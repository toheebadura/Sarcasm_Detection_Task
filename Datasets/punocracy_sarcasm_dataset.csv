Holy holy — and other Nigerian diseases,https://punocracy.com/holy-holy-and-other-nigerian-diseases/,2025-04-19T08:46:49+01:00,"By:Gift Ijeoma
Nigeria, the country, is dead. Gone. Kaput. But the Nigeriancommunity? Oh, it’s alive—and not just breathing, but singing, shouting, arguing, and dancing azonto at the same time. Somehow, in the middle of dysfunction, poverty, and persistent power cuts, we’ve built a community that thrives in spite of the chaos. We are masters of survival, comedians in suffering, and experts at pretending everything is fine—especially on Sundays.
At the core of this loud, complex survival is a set of unspoken societal viruses. Diseases that walk around looking like culture, that dress up in agbada and gele, and sometimes lead prayer meetings. From performative holiness to generational trauma dressed as discipline, these issues have become so normalised that anyone who dares to question them is quickly labelled disrespectful, unserious, or worse—”un-African.”
This piece is not a solution. It is a spotlight, a mirror, and maybe even a loudspeaker. Because some things need to be said, even if they ruffle a few feathers in the elders’ WhatsApp group chat.
Elders and entitlement – a chronic condition
In the Nigerian social ladder, age is currency. Once you cross a certain threshold—usually 40 and above—you are automatically awarded the right to speak anyhow, demand respect, and avoid accountability. Questioning an elder, even politely, is interpreted as rebellion. Correction is disrespect. And if you insist on boundaries, you are reminded that “na person born you.”
This unchecked reverence allows toxicity to grow under the excuse of tradition. The result is a society where young people are expected to swallow insults, endure injustice, and keep saying “yes sir” until they eventually become the elder that no one can question. A generational full circle of silence.
Bleach and believe – colourism as tradition
We don’t talk enough about how deeply colourism has rooted itself in the Nigerian beauty standard. Skin tones are now a class system. Light-skinned girls are called “fine,” while dark-skinned girls are asked if they spend too much time under the sun.
Entire industries thrive on selling inferiority to people, convincing them to rub away their natural complexion in exchange for acceptance. It’s not just about preference anymore—it’s psychological warfare. Yet, society claps for the result and pretends the damage isn’t deeper than the skin.
Church clothes and covered wounds – religion as image control
Religion in Nigeria is less about transformation and more about reputation. We have churches on every street and morality in every mouth, yet corruption, abuse, and oppression remain national hobbies. The problem isn’t faith—it’s the culture we’ve built around it.
People are raised to believe suffering is spiritual. They’re told to fast their way through emotional abuse, and to forgive predators if they can quote Psalm 91. We have glorified silence and called it submission. And because nobody wants to offend “men of God,” many people suffer in silence, hiding wounds under long skirts and choir uniforms.
Parenting or psychological warfare?
The Nigerian parenting handbook is often a collection of trauma responses. Children are expected to be obedient, grateful, brilliant, humble, and strong—usually all before the age of 12. If you express emotions, you’re weak. If you express opinion, you’re stubborn. If you speak up, you’re disrespectful.
Love is rarely spoken. Instead, it is implied through food, school fees, and the occasional “go and bring my slippers.” Many grow up craving validation, only to repeat the same patterns with their own children. It’s a cycle that goes unchecked, because discipline and emotional abuse are still mistaken for the same thing.
Classism – rich people also cry (but in Range Rovers)
In Nigeria, being rich doesn’t just give you access—it gives you a different passport within your own country. The wealthy float above societal issues like potholes and NEPA. They speak with accents that only come out in Ikoyi and pretend not to understand why minimum wage can’t buy fuel.
Meanwhile, the poor are mocked for daring to exist loudly. They are told to hustle more, pray harder, and be patient—as though poverty is a choice, and not a symptom of a deeply unequal system. Instead of fixing the ladder, we’ve made a culture out of blaming the people stuck at the bottom.
Ageism – too young to matter, too old to change
Young Nigerians are constantly told they’re “the leaders of tomorrow,” but when tomorrow comes, they’re told to wait a little longer. You must earn your right to speak, usually by watching your elders make terrible decisions in peace.
Innovation, new ideas, and fresh voices are often silenced—not because they’re wrong, but because they’re young. At the other end of the spectrum, elders are allowed to grow old without growing up. Their age is used as a shield to deflect any and all correction. And so, the cycle continues: silence the young, excuse the old, repeat.
A nation of survivors, not citizens
In Nigeria, we survive more than we live. We normalise trauma, decorate dysfunction, and market suffering as part of our identity. But beneath all that madness is something oddly beautiful—a community spirit that refuses to die. We share food during hard times, laugh during blackouts, and somehow make magic with madness.
The country may be failing, but the people are fighting. And that’s the paradox: a dead society held together by a vibrant, resilient, fiercely loving community. We may be sick with many diseases, but we are not dead inside. The question now is—will we keep managing the symptoms, or will we finally treat the root?"
How to become a campus politician in Nigeria: A satirical guide,https://punocracy.com/how-to-become-a-campus-politician-in-nigeria-a-satirical-guide/,2025-04-05T09:46:45+01:00,"By:Erinola E. Daranijo
Congratulations! You’ve made it to a Nigerian university. Whether you got in by passing the matriculation exam (on your third or fourth attempt), bribing an uncle in the admission office, or mistakenly getting transferred to a department you never applied for—Agricultural Extension and Rural Developmentwhen you originally wantedLaw—you are here now.
But you must understand something: you cannot just be an ordinary student. Ordinary students go to class, write exams, and graduate. And then what? Join the teeming population of unemployed graduates roaming the streets with brown envelopes? No! You mustblowwhile on campus. And I have just the perfect career for you—Campus Politics!
So, dear future leader (who might never actually lead anything), let me take you through the holy commandments of becoming a campus politician in Nigeria. Follow these rules, and I assure you, by your final year, you will be giving TEDx speeches on “The Future of Youth Leadership in Africa.”
Every great campus politician must decide early what type of leader they want to be. Do you want to be thesmooth talkerwho never actually does anything (asenator)? Or thetyrantwho clings to power like a Nigerian landlord refusing to refund a tenant’s caution fee?
If you’re the smooth talker, your job is simple: form alliances, overuse words like“representation”and“inclusivity,”and write long WhatsApp broadcasts nobody will read. If you’re the tyrant, be prepared to threaten, manipulate, and intimidate—yes, even your own campaign team. Either way,nothing must actually change on campusunder your administration. That’s the golden rule.
Your campaign needs a slogan—something deep, yet vague. You don’t want people actually understanding what you stand for. Here are some options:
As long as it sounds inspiring when chanted at night with a megaphone, you’re good to go.
A good campus politician never promises small things. You mustpromise the impossible:
But here’s the trick—when you win and fail to deliver, just blame“structural challenges”and“administrative bottlenecks.”Your job is not to solve problems but to master the art ofEnglish without action.
A politician is nothing without a strong campaign squad. You need:
Remember, a good team is the difference between winning the election and watching your opponent throw a victory party while you cry in your hostel.
Every campus politician must win debates without actually saying anything meaningful. Here’s how:
If stuck, just shout “ARE YOU READY FOR CHANGE??” and let the crowd respond. If your school has a Literary & Debating Society, join it, but do nothing. During interviews, claim they helped you build your public speaking skills.
A campus politician must shake hands and smile at every event. Whether it’s a lecture, a cultural night, or a burial ceremony—be there, hand out your flyers, and shake hands with a pained, rehearsed smile.
You must know every student by name (or at least pretend to). If you forget someone’s name, just say“Ah, my bro/sister, you’re looking good! Don’t worry, we’re winning this for the people!”When you are running for a post, your mother becomes a mother of plenty.
It’s not enough to campaign—you must also damage your opponent’s reputation. Spread believable but unprovable rumors, like:
Fear not, nobody will bother to fact-check anything. However,do notspread fake rumours yourself. That is what your team is for. If you’re lucky and find a 2017 press article about a misdemeanour your opponent committed, you are in luck; resurface it.
If you follow these steps, congratulations! You have won. But remember,once you win, disappear.
Now that you have mastered the game,why stop at campus politics?Your next step is real-world Nigerian politics. The skills you’ve learned—lying, making fake promises, dodging responsibilities, and using big grammar to confuse people—are exactly what you need to contest for office in Nigeria.
After all,isn’t campus just a rehearsal for the main thing?

A country of people aspiring to madness,https://punocracy.com/a-country-of-people-aspiring-to-madness/,2025-03-29T11:08:55+01:00,"By:Hurricane Dave
Many years ago, I left my country to escape a tragic end.
Now, as I remember home, I can assure you that it is not nostalgia I feel. Instead, I remember my country with a shudder of disgust. Things have changed, but not for the better.
Today, I will tell you the tale of a country that imprisons her freedom fighters and immortalises corrupt leaders. I come from a country where the wicked are proud to flaunt their wickedness, and good men hide to avoid being called weak.
I come from a land where things are far from ideal. The saddest part is that the citizens take pride in this. They call it “uniqueness”. Weird, right? Well, what do you expect from a country where you can see two perfectly “sane” men on the street arguing about who is madder?
“Guy, ask about me, I dey craze gan o,” the first man would assert. To which the second man would say, “Na where your madness stop, my own begin o!” That should have been my first clue that something was terribly wrong. How could sane people want to be mad so much?
When I thought I had seen the height of it, they showed me an all-time high. It was time for elections, and I realised that some of the citizens who appeared to be the sanest were actually the most insane. I come from the “most educated” ethnic group in my country. Yet, during the elections, those same educated people were convinced to vote for a man who had no plans — just because he claimed it was his turn. Emilokan was the slang on everyone’s lips, and he won the “election”.
Clueless Emilokan came into government and turned a land flowing with milk and honey into a land where birds no longer sounded like birds. Yet, through all of this, the citizens kept smiling and suffering.
Of course, some complained about the government on social media. Some made videos and had to apologise afterward for speaking the truth. Others stood by their words and were thrown into jail by criminals. Yes, the country was a living paradox.
The truth was that no one dared protest on the streets, not after the incident during the last protest. The military opened fire on peaceful protesters, then conveniently disappeared the bodies and ensured that the CCTV cameras in the area were mysteriously off duty that night. That was the night they finally crushed the collective soul of the citizens.
“You can imprison my body but you no fit capture my soul”? They didn’t just capture our souls. They squashed it. We were broken and never recovered. The rulers got what they wanted. Docile followers, incapable of nothing but a few dissents here and there. The prison song is still a great song but I sincerely hope that there are some citizens in that land with liberated souls. I hope, because I am an indefatigable optimist.
In my country, corruption is the order of the day. Bribes have become so normalised that even kids demand bribes from their mates. Collectively, the citizens decry the corruption of contractors who execute government contracts shoddily. The giant craters called “potholes” on our roads are evidence of this. Yet, those who decry the corruption of these contractors also seek bribes before doing their jobs.
I come from a country of religious people, yet we are the most corrupt nation on earth. In my country, even the oppressed oppress other people.
I know you are waiting for the events that led to my departure from my country. Sadly, the events are yet to occur. I am a dedicated citizen who still harbours hope for a better country. Yet, a part of me wants to leave it all behind. I feel like a caged bird that dreams of freedom. Freedom to spread my wings. Freedom to attain my greatest potential.
Well, until this is fulfilled, these remain the dark thoughts of a disillusioned Nigerian youth who wants the best for his country but also wants to escape the cage.

The ordeal of the Nigerian Twitter feminist,https://punocracy.com/the-ordeal-of-the-nigerian-twitter-feminist/,2025-02-01T12:58:40+01:00,"By:Omamofe Esther
Feminism:“A social theory or political movement which argues that legal and social restrictions on women must be removed in order to bring about equality of the sexes in all aspects of public and private.”
Nigerians witnessed a full-blown gender war on Twitter in the first two weeks of 2025. “Gender war” — a term Twitter Patriarchy FC has abused like paracetamol.
A woman who wakes up at 5 am to prepare her husband’s lunch, do chores, look after her kids (if there are any), does not wear makeup or wigs, and wears an overflowing boubou 24/7 is tagged an “ideal wife or a virtuous woman”.
You know who you must avoid? A woman who does not cook or clean every day, who outsources food and cleaning services regularly, who has a career, who is ambitious, or — God forbid — who hires nannies to watch her kids while chasing her dreams and living her life. The icing on the cake would be an unmarried woman, a divorcee, and a feminist who is also a baddie. LOL! This category of women are tagged “bitter, wicked, frustrated witches”.
According to Twitter Patriarchy FC, a woman who cares for her man offline and “fights” for her rights or the rights of women online is merely a “Twitter feminist”. When a woman advocates for equal rights on Twitter, she is merely pretending and grandstanding. To Nigerian men, she lives a much different reality that revolves around her man and family. This misogynistic concept is deeply rooted in Nigeria’s patriarchal society, which has constructed the belief that women were born to become homemakers and men’s footstools.
The termTwitter Feminismis misconstrued by many people, and this misunderstanding diminishes its importance and undermines its purpose. Many see the participants of this movement as “bitter” women who have nothing to offer but antagonism against men. Maybe it is true that some women use feminism as a weapon to get revenge on men for their experiences, but that is not the goal of “Twitter Feminism”.
Twitter feminists are women who are not afraid of shutting down misogyny and abuse against women in any form. A lot of women and girls have taken refuge under this movement as it allows them to reach out to feminists who are willing to protect them from the snare of men. This protection has caused feminism to spread like wildfire among women.
There is an enlightenment on the patriarchal standards and mindset of Nigerian men, which has caused men to feel threatened and outsmarted. Because of this, the feminist movement on Nigerian Twitter has put a strain on the relationship between both genders in the country.
Is it not true that one of the greatest fears of the average Nigerian man is that his wife says she cannot cook or do chores or identifies as a feminist? They will run naked on the streets of Twitter and weep like a jilted groom.
Twitter Feminism in Nigeria is a movement set to liberate women from the patriarchal chains that bound their wrists, hence, the strong opposition. Women are “witches” for wanting to fly above the patriarchal walls, but whoever flies over that wall has seen the full brightness of the day.
“Nigerian Twitter Feminism is the last stage a lady gets to before becoming a full-blown witch.”

Voltrons: Defenders of the rising sun,https://punocracy.com/voltrons-defenders-of-the-rising-sun/,2025-01-25T10:41:53+01:00,"By:Ekene Ezebuike
Like the spirited efforts of the government to fight corruption, this story is meant to elicit concern but not be taken seriously. If you are looking for a serious piece, look elsewhere. And, please, don’t let the title fool you. There are no animated characters, giant robots, or aliens in the story, only real people with real follies and real solutions — solutions that work even to this very day.
Once upon a happenstance, the people of the valley where the sun rises were beset by all forms of marginalisation, subjugation, intimidation, exploitation and all other—tionsthat bode despair. They were treated like strangers — nay, pariahs — in their own country. Who would blame them for seeking to break away and forge a new path? There is a limit to what a people can endure.
And like all oppressed people, there arose amongst them a band of warriors who took it upon themselves to free the people from bondage. This band of warriors cleverly employed the most unconventional and bizarre strategies in their pursuit of emancipation. At first, the people applauded them, arguing that an ailment that has never been seen before cannot be cured with everyday herbs. And so, the band of warriors grew very powerful and were admired and feared in equal measure.
But how does one vanquish an enemy that has both the yam and the knife? How does one engage a foe who is better armed and organised? The band of warriors, in their ingenuity and clairvoyance, developed an excellent plan:terrorise and inflict so much pain on your own people that the enemy will tremble and wonder what will be done to him if the very people he oppresses are so afflicted by their own kin. Sadly, this brilliant idea divided the people. While some applauded it, others advised caution, arguing that terrorising the already afflicted dwellers of the valley where the sun rises would be tantamount to going into full self-destruct mode.
The naysayers were swiftly rounded up, labelled enemy collaborators, and exterminated like the rats they were. Having rid the valley of rats, the band of warriors proceeded with their patriotic idea. And so, in order to strike mortal dread into the heart of the enemy, the warriors banned their own kinsmen from gathering, selling, buying, or working on the first market day of each new week.
But the enemy did not recoil or flee in horror. On the contrary, the enemy found new vigour and even better ways of afflicting the people of the valley where the sun rises. Then, the band of warriors proceeded to abduct, kill, and maim their own brothers in order to put the fear of God into the enemy. But again, the enemy remained indifferent and resolute.
The band of warriors had to up the ante. They burnt down their own markets, schools, and hospitals, but when the enemy showed no signs of retreating, they burnt down their own houses and became displaced persons in their own ancestral lands. Freedom comes at a cost, they argued. ‘And like a phoenix,’ they boasted, ‘a new republic will rise from these ruins and ashes.’ The people scratched their heads in doubt but kept their thoughts and opinions to themselves as the band of warriors had become so powerful that they now made naysayers disappear.
The enemies, with satisfaction and pride, observed from the safety of their fortress across the great river as the house they sought to pull down caught fire of its own accord and was reduced to rubble. With no enemy to fight, the band of warriors who have since taken refuge in the dense jungles in the valley now haunt their kin, burning more houses, killing more people, and making more naysayers disappear, all in an effort to emancipate the dwellers of the valley where the sun rises.

The tax collectors,https://punocracy.com/the-tax-collectors/,2024-12-31T10:36:28+01:00,"By:Abdullahi Oladeji Popoola
The last time I coughed, I looked around to confirm that Banku was not at my back to demand a tax. Anything you do here, you must pay for it. This is how we live in the Bolebaji community. The only thing Banku and his bloodthirsty boys are satisfied you do for free is shedding tears of agony. Tears of joy are not free.
Banku and his boys do not own a parcel of land anywhere one could think of. When they show up while you are turning the sod on your site, you don’t argue with them. Those who have argued with them in the past do not only blame themselves after the dust of chaos settles but also risk court proceedings for manslaughter. Those who know Banku do not argue with him when he and his boys infest a site or ask for a tax.
It is only on a few occasions that he comes with ten boys to ask for his levy when someone is siting a building on a plot of land in the community. He comes with ten thugs only when he has been informed the landowner won’t cause trouble. However, if it were otherwise—that is, the landowner would also station thugs—Banku would be accompanied by a drove of thugs in a cloud of marijuana smoke.
Many things can be said about Bolebaji, but how Banku rose to the status of god is especially interesting. Hearsay has it that as a young boy, he was known to cause trouble in school. If he was not caught in a fight with a classmate, he was walking around the premises engaging with vagabonds and political thugs. One day, the principal was fed up and expelled him. This drew the curtain on his education, and Banku began to build his name on the street. He first gained prominence in the media when he snatched ballot boxes for an opposition party announced as the winner of a free and fair election some years ago. He wines and dines with politicians. At one point, he began to grant press interviews. It is right to say the media helped him gain more popularity.
In Bolebaji, Banku owns a house he received as a gift from a generous politician. From this house, he receives first-hand information about whatever goes on in the community. Perhaps it is better to say it is from here he governs the community.
Everyone knows Banku’s house. It is painted white, and as the day breaks, throngs of old women and men line up at his gate for alms. On many occasions, his boys chase them away with canes and curses. That is Banku’s boys anyway, but sometimes they leave them while they await Banku, who might not show up till dusk. The Baale of the community wines and dines with Banku. No one even cares to report Banku to Baale when he and his boys threaten the community with tax. On a few occasions when people report to Baale, his response was always the same, “Go to station.”
There was one bloodletting event that claimed the life of a man in Bolebaji. The news is still everywhere on the Internet. One famous newspaper’s front page proclaimed, “Banku Saves Bolebaji from Thugs as Man Feared Dead.” Funny enough, that they do not attribute the thugs who murdered the landowner to Banku. They simply say Banku’s swift intervention led to the restoration of peace. What makes everything helpless is how other media outlets copycat the distorted stories.
What caused the death of the man is not sketchy. Banku was informed that he had bought land from Baale and was planning to begin the construction of a building on the land as quickly as possible. It was said that the man who bought the land had just returned from a foreign country. That morning, people were already working on the site when Banku’s boys descended on it. They came on a hundred motorcycles, and there were around three hundred thugs holding all kinds of substances and weapons.
On sighting them, the landowner spokevocabulary, but none of the thugs seemed to understand a word. All they wanted was money, not stories. When the landowner said he would call the police, the ringleader said the police were their patrons. This became clear when the landowner phoned a police station and was informed to “settle them.” The landowner threatened them with soldiers; they claimed the army was their “padi.” Baale told him to give them what they wanted when he called Baale. That was when the landowner furiously told the ringleader to go to hell. The words did not sit well with the ringleader, who ordered his boys to treat the man.
It was the second day after the man received the treatment of Banku’s boys that he was pronounced dead in a private hospital. How Banku intervened is what every sensible person in Bolebaji is still asking the government and the media.
When the family of the deceased threatened Banku, he told them — half-laughing — to go to court.

An apology to literary magazines I bombarded with nonsense,https://punocracy.com/an-apology-to-literary-magazines-i-bombarded-with-nonsense/,2024-12-17T08:23:21+01:00,"By:Chisom Benedicta Nsiegbunam
I choose to write this now because I believe I have matured. Yes, I am mature enough to call this an apology because home training taught me to greet first and apologise first—doing these things makes you a more mature person.
If I had written this a few months ago, forget this apology and maturity thing. It would have been filled with my honest, esteem-shattered two cents because these magazines can cause serious depression. Heartbreaks worse than breakfasts. It doesn’t give room for tears many times; it just sits in the chest.
The one that is still paining me—not in a deep way because maturity does a lot— is the way they make rejection emails sound so sweet. If you won’t publish my work, simply say, “Sorry, we won’t publish this. Try again next time.” At least I’d get it straight up. But no, some magazines that love drama will first raise your heart rate with the arrival of the email. Then, in two lines, they deliver their ‘thank you’ speech about how much they appreciate the opportunity to read your work. Such an honour. Then, they state, with as much sincerity as they can muster, how carefully they have considered it. Just when your hopes peak, they drop it—their regrets for rejecting your submission. If you have this much regret, why not just accept it and stop pulling the brakes on somebody’s heart?
Let’s not even get started about magazines that send rejection emails five months later—even after stating in their guidelines, “We do not accept simultaneous submissions.” But they still have the audacity, the kind that can’t be bought in the market, to send their email first thing in the morning, on a day the Lord has made and we are supposed to be glad. As for the ones that don’t bother sending any mail, don’t mention.
Honestly, there are two types of rejections I still don’t understand: the ones that tell you how promising your piece is but they can’t publish it (interesting) and those ones that inform you that you made their shortlist but got knocked off by stronger competitions (intriguing). Is that so? What is the use of this information? To tell me how close I got but how I was still not good enough?
Ehnn, when they add, ‘I hope this piece finds home soon,’ please o (curiosity made me ask), is it out of courtesy or they just want end on a smooth note?
But as I stated earlier, all these are not why I am writing this. I am more mature now, and I definitely wouldn’t write these things anymore. I understand now: rejections are a push to try elsewhere, read more, and write better. After all, taste in literature, like in everything else, differs and evolves. Sometimes, who knows, it might actually mean you should trash the work, but having faith in one’s writing is important.
Lastly, I am here to apologise to some very particular magazines—I will not call names; they should know themselves. I am heartily sorry for using you to train my perseverance muscles. Truly, only you guys have earned my apology because I understand now why you no longer bother to send me any rejection emails. Don’t worry; I understand the silent treatment. This is my mature self saying sorry for bombarding you with half-baked stories out of desperation to be published or validated. This apology does not in any way mean you should not expect more entries from me because, as they say, go hard or go home. With strengthened muscles, maturity and learning, I intend to continue going hard.
Sincerely,
A Nigerian Writer.

What it means to be a fine girl in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/what-it-means-to-be-a-fine-girl-in-nigeria/,2024-12-07T08:11:27+01:00,"By:Chizitere Madeleine Nwaemesi
There are many types of Fine Girls. We have the Fragile Princess, the Femme Fatale, and the Fancy Feminist—to mention just a few. Before you start assessing where you fit in, I need you to know that being a Fine Girl will cost you. It doesn’t matter what type of Fine Girl you choose to be. Not being a Fine Girl will also cost you; this one is certain. Remember that you are a woman: everything you do or refuse to do in this life will find a way to pull your wig.
This is why there are many societal expectations placed on Fine Girls but none for Fine Boys. It’s important for you to know these things, which is why I chose to write this essay—for every aspiring Fine Girl to gain the knowledge and insight required to successfully navigate through life.
As a Fine Girl, it’s possible that your life might be heavily influenced by the expectations others place on you. These expectations could relate to how you should behave, dress, or live your life, often shaped by societal norms, cultural values, or the perceptions of those around you. In essence, you must have the humility to accept that external pressures or standards may dictate significant aspects of your identity or choices rather than allowing you the freedom to define your own path.
Last year, I hopped on a Keke Napep on my way to somewhere I cannot remember. Before I got in, a schoolboy stood with me and wanted to get on too. But he was not able to agree on a favourable fare with the driver and he stepped back. Meanwhile, I was already seated in the front seat beside the driver, because I didn’t want the schoolboy (obviously a child) to sit at the front. A lot of people do not like to sit at the front because it doesn’t give passengers the comfort and prestige they crave when boarding public transportation. You have to sit with one of your knees facing out. Not forgetting, you have to hold something, anything, to keep your balance. Also, you have to brace up for the ride because you’re going to be sort of an assistant driver, enduring the feel of his body against yours while he drives.
Based on these factors, a woman is not expected to sit there. Not to talk of a Fine Girl. I wallowed a while in regret after we left the schoolboy behind, not because I chose the wrong seat but because I didn’t make sure he got on that ride. I was awoken from my regrets when a man who took the place of the boy touched me to ask, “Why did you sit there? Don’t you know a fine girl like you should not sit there? You will not be comfortable.” I didn’t need him to say more to know I had failed in my duty as a Fine Girl.
What is a Fine Girl not supposed to do exactly? Let’s start with the basics.
A Fine Girl is not supposed to be found squeezing her face. When you’re deeply offended, just cry. Sweet tears. Don’t fight. Don’t shout. Don’t swear. Just cry. Silky tears smearing your beautiful cheeks and heavy makeup. That is how to be a Fine Girl. The trick is to act emotionally vulnerable enough that you will get treated as a victim. Men love the idea of a damsel in distress, and they will shower you with sympathies and support (most times monetary) even when you don’t need either. Once you understand how easy it is to exploit the masculine worship of beauty, manipulating men becomes second nature to you.
There are some unwritten laws in this world, laws that define the social contracts governing human relations, and one of those laws states that a Fine Girl can do no harm. Call it pretty privilege or whatever, but as a Fine Girl, never take for granted the fact that you can get away with murder. All you need is some tears and smiles for your innocence to shine through. People look at your beauty and see not only your own goodness but they imagine it reflecting back on them. It’s in this way that your beauty isn’t merely a passport to having a good life but a gift you are meant to treat with care and respect. Yes, as a Fine Girl, you must respect your own beauty enough to place it on a high pedestal so that when others encounter it, they instantly recognise the immense value yourFineGirlbilitybestows on you.
On the subject of value, it’s important to clarify that a Fine Girl is not supposed to put anything other than her beauty first. It’s not enough for you to be a narcissistic diva. You must be the world’s greatest narcissistic diva because what is worth doing is worth doing well. A Fine Girl who has failed in her responsibility to her beauty would most likely be confronted by some of the following aura-demystifying enquiries:
What do you mean you don’t use skin care products? Fine Girl like you? What do you mean you are trekking? Fine Girl like you? What do you mean you don’t go clubbing? Fine Girl like you? What do you mean you haven’t been to Candlelight before? Fine Girl like you? What do you mean you’re drinking green bottle? Fine Girl like you?
What do you mean your perfume is three thousand five hundred naira? What do you mean you paid with your money? What do you mean you don’t bill men? What do you mean you don’t stay out late? What do you mean you want to study Engineering? What do you mean you’re studying Mortuary Science? What do you mean you cannot buy a handbag for a hundred kay? What do you mean you don’t have Vietnamese bone straight, or even Brazilian? What do you mean you cannot pay for Bolt? What do you mean you don’t use an iPhone? What do you mean you sit in front of Keke Napep? What do you mean by you’re still a virgin? What do you mean you don’t have a boyfriend? What do you mean you have one boyfriend? What do you mean you eat swallow?
—Fine Girl like you?
A lot of girls don’t even know they are Fine Girls until they are hit with a “Fine Girl like you” statement. This is how our enjoyment started. Because as a Fine Girl, you’re not supposed to be found wanting, broke, or desperate. These three inconveniences will mess with your self-esteem so much that when you look in the mirror, the only thing you will see is a girl rather than a Fine Girl.
The transition starts with being called a Princess, Angel, Pretty, Asa, to – boom! – an obvious Fine Girl. And please, when you’re being called a Fine Girl, remember to smile shyly, pat your hair and make comments like, “Like this? With this my hair? I’m not that fine. My friend is finer. My sister is finer.” Being in denial strengthens yourFineGirlbility.
Though I must warn you, being a Fine Girl comes with a lot of hard work. That voice that is telling you that everyone is staring at you? Believe it. Do I need to say more? When a man is being overly nice to you, it’s in your best interest to assume he only wants what every other man wants from you. Make sure you are smart. You don’t need to be perfect, but be good at projecting a sense of perfection. Be soft. Speak slowly, no matter what. People have patience for Fine Girls. But that’s not what matters. What matters is what and who you have patience for. Never make the mistake of being patient with someone or a situation that doesn’t deserve your grace.
A Fine Girl should be selective, painstakingly selective in her choices. Because why will you be giving an audience to a boy inside Keke Napep? Yes. You boarded Keke too but you’re a Fine Girl, you deserve better. What happened to men in flashy rides? Have you forgotten a Fine Girl aims higher? And what will people say when they see you with a boy who cannot even send you dinner dress, money for lashes, nails, hair, a boy who cannot book Bolt or pick you up? Even when the boy is fine enough and speaks fine, he needs to step up or stay down. Fine Girl cannot be with a boy she met in Keke Napep. Fine Girl needs maintenance. Fine Girl doesn’t send men money; she only has time for men who ask her how much she wants. Fine Girl doesn’t reply to messages fast, doesn’t ask a man if he’s eaten, or visit a man at his house. If he can’t take you out to the newest restaurant in town, he can forget about ever seeing your shadow.
Before I forget, if anyone ever questions your taste, ask them whether they know what it means to be a Fine Girl? Of course, they would never know. Only Fine Girls know. A Fine Girl never settles. Always remember that. You’re not expected to be content. You have to always want the newest, latest, fanciest, silkiest, loveliest, and costliest things.
The world is your playground. Play everything and everyone, but make sure not to play yourself. You deserve everything beautiful. It doesn’t matter if you come from a family that cannot afford milk. You’re a Fine Girl, and a Fine Girl can go from zero to a hundred.
Carry your shoulders high. You can be rude to strangers, waiters, servers, housekeepers, ushers, Bolt drivers, handymen, service technicians, anybody except the big boys and big men, of course. You’re a Fine Girl.
Now, here are people to avoid.
People who do not care about yourFineGirlbility. People who accuse you of things like using bone straight to cover an empty head. People who look you dead in the eyes because they’re not swayed by your expensive makeup, your blue/pink contact lenses, silky blunt cut hair or your exotic perfume. They’re ready to point out your foolishness for paying for that Peekaboo handbag instead of registering for masterclasses. These kinds of people do not know that being a Fine Girl is enough work, a lifelong career. You do not need another. People who think you’re like every other girl out there. People who call you a woman instead of Fine Girl. People who ask you what you want to be in the future. People who think you can be so much more aside from being a Fine Girl. People who believe that your beauty will fade. People who think you spend unnecessarily on trendy stuff. How can they not know that a Fine Girl only wears what is trendy? People who think you’re entitled because you’re demanding an allowance as a Fine Girl. People who have no prospect of being rich. People who are not already wealthy. People who are classless—having neither old money nor new money. People who take life too seriously. People who think you’re being insensitive for sending “I need hundred kay” to fifty men at a go and blocking those who didn’t deliver. People who expect you to stand in queues and wait for your turn. People who ask what you bring to the table. People who wouldn’t catch a cold when you sneeze. Avoid all.
On a final note: A Fine Girl’s life is precious, and her prime is short. Las las, somebody has to take an everlasting responsibility for your life. Always keep that fact at the forefront of anything you do. Choose wisely from the flock and fast. Again. All that stress of thinking about anything aside from how you look and feel should be abolished. People will disagree, but take it from me. You are the prize.

Nigeria’s masterclass on fighting corruption,https://punocracy.com/nigerias-masterclass-on-fighting-corruption/,2024-10-19T10:46:25+01:00,"By:Abdullah Ajibade
Before long, Nigeria, with its wealth of experience in the fine art of fighting corruption will extend its Masterclass to many African countries—because who is better to lead the charge than a seasoned expert in the field?
As a Muslim, Fridays have always been special for me, but the most recent one came with special juices, credit to the words of Mr. Humphrey Geise, Namibia’s Ambassador to Nigeria, while paying a courtesy call to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) headquarters.
He said, “The fight against corruption is taking a new dimension in the continent and we believe Nigeria should lead in sharing its expertise in the fight against corruption and we hope it will open its doors to other African countries like Namibia to learn.
“We feel ICPC and the EFCC should be able to go the extra mile to share their remarkable achievements. It’s not good for Namibia to go outside the continent to learn this.”
When I stumbled upon this glorifying perspective, I had to fact-check—not because it was false, but to beat the question: is this all? I had expected more from the Ambassador. Something not far from the glamorous way the former governor of Delta state, James Ibori, was welcomed after serving his jail term in a UK prison—a true carnival! (Ibori, as you know, had been convicted in a British court on charges of money laundering.)
On this, I advise Namibia to step up its efforts. If you want Nigeria’s help, you have to acknowledge the full extent of the country’s anti-graft magic.
In a proper big brother flex, the ICPC chairman confirmed that the agency is open for partnership and even highlighted that the training arm of the agency would come handy to see to the training request for personnel of the Namibian Anti-Corruption Commission.
Beyond this training, I will also contribute my part—free of Value Added Tax—by sharing a brief but insightful practical experience of fighting corruption in Nigeria. But before I do this, allow me to address a part of the Ambassadorʼs statement where he mentioned that it’s not good for Namibia to go outside the continent to learn the art of fighting corruption.
Sincerely, there is a lot to consider here as it is hard to imagine the possibility of any African country going Brazil’s way. In 2023, the countryʼs Supreme Court sentenced former president Fernando Collor de Mello to eight years and 10 months in prison for “passive corruption and money laundering.”
Why look outside when we have more useful case studies back home, such as the White Lion of Ajaokuta Garden, who moved a meagre $720,000 from public funds to pay a child’s school fees as a way to demonstrate that the youths are truly the leaders of tomorrow and thus deserve proper care.
Moreover, African leaders and politicians are less corrupt compared to their abroad counterparts. And before you mention the Maina Pension Scam in Nigeria, don’t forget that the accused isn’t a leader or politician. Abdulrasheed Maina, the chairman of the Pension Pension Reform Task Team, was accused of looting N195 billion of the pension funds that affected about 141,790 pensioners. Per African standards, he’s a chairman, not a politician or leader.
Now, based on practical experience, I will be discussing six proven methods that has helped to solving corruption cases faster and easier in Nigeria.
While these are proven methods to fighting corruption based on practical experience, the icing on it is organising a group of loyalist state governors to lead campaigns against the anti-corruption agency and even pursue legal action. This strategy will spur the energy to fight corruption.
Contrary to Ngozi Okonjo Iwealaʼs view that fighting corruption is dangerous, these outlined methods make it easier when executed properly. Meanwhile, Nigerians have been too ungrateful to celebrate the countryʼs anti-graft efforts. One even said the attempt by Namibia is like Tottenham seeking insights from Arsenal on how to win a Champions League.

God is slow,https://punocracy.com/god-is-slow/,2024-10-05T07:49:47+01:00,"By:Michelle Nnanyelugo
when I think about God
I picture his love for me in parenthesis
(a passover meal of burnt beans)
/ mashed into a fillet of leftover alms /
beseeching my starving soul for a revival
like pretence, our conversations taste bitter
except for the morning, my sister yelled at God
chronicled my agony into a bowl of tears
/ lavish offering /
this mourning: a tingling wake-up call
/ at ungodly hours /
I hatch my supplications into an ark
a drawing book where I sketch a memorial of platitudes –
/ fine art /
a patina of prayer requests
for an immersive solo exhibition at God’s courtyard:
/ a gallery of mockery /
my affliction is trapped in God’s armpit
/ me /
/ a wilderness /
genuflect for deliverance under a pulpit
buckle my soul into prophecy
professing my sermon note
/ hoping God talks to me /
yet he never does
on this canvas, I contour my problems onto a talking stage
brew a foretaste of this testimony
acclaim this wait; an alleluia
/ but God is the genesis of my lamentations /
he puts asunder
/ in our listening party /
so, I abide on urgent commentary – solemn, riddled monologues
because he is forgetful
the love he has for me is in past tense
/ shrunken /
a heartfelt persecution cleft for my penance
in this vigil, I crumble
swoon my posture into a prayer pod –
/ contrite vessel /
wiggle my petitions with trembling lips
a bouquet of unknown tongues brimming
/ me and 11 others /
dazzle our altars with amplified groans
in fervour
summoning my problems before God
/ asking heaven to help me/
today, I would bleed on paper
swindle this body into a fake smile
haunt memories I have long forgotten
paddle this anguish into abyss
and rapture this guilt unto judgement
/ God is slow /
or maybe he’s taking his time
and now,
/ for this finale/
I exodus this longing to a pilgrimage
/me /
/ prodigal /
pronounce this worship
/ a plague /
with no words left
in this medley of
/ frequently asked questions /
I surrender this relic befitting for repentance
knowing I have been utterly forsaken
(for my trespasses)

The parable of the shrewd father,https://punocracy.com/the-parable-of-the-shrewd-father/,2024-09-07T09:18:25+01:00,"By:Ekene Ezebuike
It is truly amazing what hunger can do to the human psyche. As Nigerians gradually gear up to resort to open grazing, I decided to travel to my ancestral home in search of greener pastures. Do not laugh, please. I figured there would be more edible grasses and, if I am lucky, vegetables in the village. But it was not only hunger that forced me to travel home. I wanted to spend some time with my grandfather.
My grandfather? A jolly old chap he is! But he forbids politics and all government-related palavers. Such things bother him a great deal. Only two things matter to him – pool betting and palm wine. He is simple like that. Anyhow, when I got home and my grandfather pulled me aside to lament how the hardship caused by some imbecile government policies had affected pool betting and the price of palm wine, I knew there was trouble. Real trouble! Since he forbids political discussions and government hocus-pocus, he spoke strictly in parables.
‘Have you heard of theParable of the Shrewd Father?’ he asked as he took off his pair of glasses, which he only wears to forecast and search thesystemfor bankers.
‘No, Papa,’ I replied, sitting up.
‘Well, listen then. I’ll tell you. A shrewd father once decided to cut household expenses in order to save up money for more important family needs. He made his wife and children eat only once or twice daily. Medicine was replaced with herbal concoctions and prayers, while for clothing, boutiques were ditched in favour of thrift shops. And so the shrewd father was able to save a substantial amount of money with which he bought himself a very important thing – a Rolex!’
All my efforts at persuading my grandfather to reveal the true identity of this inconsiderate father or how the parable relates to the current state of the nation failed. He merely asked me to use my tongue to count my teeth as he put his pair of glasses back on to resume his search for hidden draws. My grandfather can be strange like that, but I like him.
That night, when I retired to bed, I found it difficult to sleep. The elusive meaning of the Parable of the Shrewd Father kept me awake. When sleep finally came towards the early hours of dawn, it was laden with strange dreams. First, I was the president addressing the nation via a televised broadcast, and then I became a lamassu-like creature bursting with energy. And suddenly, I heard my grandfather’s voice:
‘You must take flight immediately and, from the sky, observe what is going on in Nigeria and report back to me right away.’
I was confused because my grandfather does not care for all the national, political nonsense. I was about to ask him if he was sure, but he was gone. So I flapped my wings, and in a few seconds, I was soaring over the length and breadth of my beloved country.
First, I arrived in Lagos. And from the sky, I observed long queues in all the filling stations within sight. Then I saw NNPCL’s Vice President (downstream), Dapo Segun, sweating profusely as he addressed a restive crowd. Mele Kyari stood at a safe distance and merely watched.
‘Be patient with us,’ Dapo pleaded. ‘Shango and Amadioha conspire to sabotage our efforts to make fuel available to Nigerians. The incessant rains, lightning, and thunderstorms are behind the fuel scarcity. We have set up a standing committee to look into the matter and find appropriate ways of appeasing the unpatriotic deities. Soon, there will be fuel in abundance, and the treacherous gods will be put to shame. We are aware that this act of sabotage is aimed at toppling the government. But it won’t work!’
I was about to change direction when a confused-looking fellow asked Dapo Segun if the standing committee would be given a sitting allowance amidst the hardship in the country. The NNPCL executive ignored him. An old woman tugged at the shirt of the confused-looking fellow and explained to him that since it was a standing committee, they would not require a sitting allowance. Then, a frail old man asked Dapo to explain the difference between fuel subsidy and shortfall. He dabbed off perspiration from his forehead with his immaculate white handkerchief and muttered something. I am not sure whether it was renewed despair or renewed hope he mentioned, but the crowd went wild with rage. I did not wait to see what happened next.
Shortly after, I was soaring over the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Wow! Looking at it from the sky, it was a great display of wealth and splendour! At the entrance of the Villa, I saw His Excellency addressing newsmen, unaccompanied by aids and security operatives. I could not believe my eyes. To be sure, I flew at a low altitude, and behold, it was His Excellency himself. His unmistakable trademark cap extinguished all my doubts.
‘Be patient with us,’ His Excellency urged the newsmen. ‘Our anti-people policies will soon begin to yield dividends. Tighten your belts and persevere a little longer. To say my father told me is to swear the greatest oath. I am your father, and I cannot lie to you. It is beneath the president to tell lies. What are my media aids and numerous spokespersons paid for? Such tasks as telling lies and reeling off misleading statistics are reserved for them. The president cannot lie.’
One of the newsmen raised his hand to ask a question, but His Excellency ignored him and continued with his monologue:
‘I told you I would hit the ground running. Did I not do so at Eagle Square during the celebration of Democracy Day? Be patient. We will keep all of our promises. All of them! As for the fuel scarcity, I will hold a meeting with the Honorable Minister of Petroleum Resources, who is, by the way, my humble self. We will have a closed-door meeting to address the issue. But the ‘shortfall or subsidy’ semantic palaver will not be discussed. We don’t want the meeting to end in deadlock, do we? It’s not a meeting between the Federal Government and ASUU. It’s a meeting between me and my humble self. Rest assured, Ajuri Ngalele and Bayo Onanuga will release a joint statement, after a brief fight, to inform Nigerians of the outcome of the meeting.’
As the newsmen were about to fire missiles of questions at His Excellency, he vanished, leaving a cloud of dust behind. Then, I changed direction again and found myself in Kano. As I hovered over the ancient city, a particular sight caught my attention. An Islamic scholar was addressing a group of students in an alley. The students had empty bowls in their hands.
‘We have been sentenced to eight years of imprisonment,’ he announced painfully as he adjusted his babariga. ‘We have successfully served just over one year. So, we have less than seven years remaining. We must remain civilised and patriotic. Protests and complaints will only compound our woes. If Allah wills it, after serving four years, we might be released on parole on account of good behaviour. Allah will not forsake us.’
At this point, the pitiless sun was beginning to sap my energy. So, I decided to fly back home to tell my grandfather all I had seen. Then I flew even higher into the sky, and behold, I saw the Niger Delta. I was drawn by the majestic creeks. I glided over narrow rivers blackened with oil. As I flew further into the hinterlands, I came across what looked like a big ceremony.
I came down to a lower altitude and realised it was the burial ceremony of a very important chief. An Amanyanagbo, I think. A truly moving sight it was! Misty-eyed mourners wailed violently and rolled about on the floor. I was moved to tears by this great show of grief. I landed immediately, and my arrival was heralded with both fanfare and ululation. Then, I was taken to a special table, away from the dirty mourners. The table was labelled IOCs. There, I was served a big bowl of starch and a plate of Banga soup filled with fresh fish and large chunks of beef. I unbuckled my belt, which I had kept fastened very tight in line with the directive of His Excellency.
Just then, I woke up to a loud bang on the door to my room. It was my grandfather. He had come to summon me to partake in his early morning breaking of kola nut and pouring of liquor to our forebears for protection and strength to face the challenges of a new day. I stumbled out of my room, my mind clouded with thoughts of starch and banga soup and fresh fish and IOCs. What a sad ending! The things being a Nigerian can do to one’s psyche.

Japa syndrome and the madness of staying,https://punocracy.com/japa-syndrome-and-the-madness-of-staying/,2024-07-13T10:29:04+01:00,"By:Okwuasaba Flourish
A small fish asks a larger fish, “I want to go to the ocean.”
The bigger fish replies, “The ocean?”
”Yes, the ocean.”
“My dear, you’re in the ocean.”
You stand in the scorching heat outside the Shehu Shagari Complex in Abuja to secure a visa for your pursuit of education abroad. You’ve meticulously rehearsed your speech, your documents clutched firmly under your arm. Although there were some last-minute tweaks that morning, you committed them to memory.
Naturally, you’re not a fast learner. You never were. Back then, when your classmates effortlessly recited the definition of business studies, you were still grappling with the phrase “business studies is a five-in-one pre-vocational subject,” squinting your eyes over the textbook repeatedly for the next phrase.
However,this na japa things. It can’t be played with. You’re nervous, and your hands are sweaty, yet you recall the advice of Uncle Kanayo, who sponsors you from Tulsa.
“Don’t give them a reason to doubt you. Look them straight in the eye and with confidence, without unnecessary trembling. Let them know you love your country and be brief. Noshalayetoo much.”
So you whisper your lines.
“Omooba Jesunifemi Torikogbo.”
“Student.”
“Educational system is poor in Nigeria.”
“No plans to extend my stay.”
“I own a small startup in my home country, which I put on hold to pursue my education in the US. Upon completion of my studies, I intend to return and grow my business by applying the skills and knowledge I’ve acquired.”
As hours pass, you reflect on the lengths one must go to in order to leave Nigeria, driven by the deteriorating state of the country. This phenomenon, often termed “brain drain,” prompts a critical question that you ask yourself: Why do so many Nigerians seek success outside their homeland?
If you looked at the top 100 investment bankers in wall street today, you’d find a healthy percentage of them are Nigerians. The top brain surgeons in the world – Nigerians, top investment banking – Nigerians, top lawyers – Nigerians. How is it that Nigeria is struggling with issues we’re struggling with but some of the smartest people in the world are Nigerians. And then you look at where you’ll find those Nigerians and typically, they’re not in Nigeria. It means you’ve got this incredible base of talent whose skills, competence and abilities are being harvested by another economy and not their economy of birth.
The Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) has said that citizens living abroad have been adjudged to be the most intelligent and educated in the US and the UK.
We see the likes of Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, the seventh director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and Chimamanda Adichie, who was named on OOOM Magazine’s list of the World’s Most Inspiring People in 2019. We also have the likes of Oluwatobi Amusan, who made history by becoming Nigeria’s first-ever gold winner at the World Athletics Championships, British-Nigerian boxer Anthony Joshua, neuropathologist Dr Bennet Omalu, computer scientist Philip Emeagwali, and billionaire businessman Aliko Dangote.
Uncle Kanayo received a chance to start anew through a stroke of luck in the visa lottery. Remarkably, he even contributed to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Among your acquaintances, there are neighbours, coursemates, secondary school classmates, church members, friends, and distant relatives who’ve sought a better life abroad, propelled by the means to do so.
Not long ago, you had a conversation with your aunt, who balances her life between Nigeria and the US. To your surprise, she suggested marriage to a stranger as a way of escaping from penury in this country. Her daughter, whose life is perfectly curated, is destined to continue her education abroad simply because she can.
If you can’t, you fall into the set of people who send messages to congratulate, to felicitate, to be happy for, to be glad to celebrate with. However, who remains to navigate the challenges at home?
Though you may not claim to have attended the finest schools, residing in the bustling brown-roofed city has stretched not only you but also your friends. You began your educational journey in a private primary school in Ibadan. You recall vividly how your headteacher attempted to persuade your father, then a lecturer and deputy provost at the State Cooperative College, to enrol you in the school’s college. Your father, valuing quality education, was adamant in sending you to a public school, oblivious to the grim state of the educational system.
Experience proved to be the finest teacher as you navigated your way in a public school. The same school Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala attended, albeit a more dilapidated version. You stood with your pink Barbie bag on wheels, shiny Bata shoes, perfectly white socks, and neatly ironed uniform, a stark contrast to your peers. The conditions need no elaborate description — inadequate facilities, makeshift seating, and rudimentary chalkboards. You have to bring your own furniture, and if it was a stool you had, that would do. You were exposed to the lives of students who, though guilty of no crime, simply lacked the opportunities most of us have.
After a year, you found your way to a more tolerable public school. From there to a private one where you were pushed beyond your own imagination.
Now, at the University of Benin, you find yourself challenging the system, not competing with anyone. We often fail to give ourselves credit for our resilience in a hard economy.
Given the opportunity to showcase our Nigerian excellence abroad, we’d undoubtedly be celebrated as some of the brightest and most talented Nigerians who have succeeded.
The lesson is clear: our environment shapes us.
The next question arises: How can we create an environment that nurtures talent and inspires it to flourish at home?
You’ve often wondered what Nigeria would be like without its persistent issues—fuel price hikes, depreciating currency, erratic power supply, substandard infrastructure, and lack of essential amenities.
You’ve also come up with the solutions. Ensure access to quality healthcare, mental health support, and well-being programs to enable individuals to flourish; implement policies that promote talent retention, fair competition, and economic stability; invest in accessible, high-quality education that equips individuals with relevant skills and knowledge; improve basic amenities like roads, electricity, healthcare, and sanitation to provide a conducive living environment and establish programmes, grants, and resources to encourage innovation.
You hold the belief that if Nigeria could provide its citizens with the same opportunities as the US, UK, Canada, or Britain, we wouldn’t be so different from them. It’s the subtle distinction between having and not having that defines our nation and its citizens. Many of us would rather cross that line into an unfamiliar land, endure potential discomfort, and be reminded of our blackness or our country’s unfortunate inability to provide what we seek. We’d rather bend, start over, and escape the suffering, the lack, the penury.
Just today, you purchased a sachet of pure water for 20 naira. You wonder if you will ever return to the days when it cost just 5 naira? As we seemingly progress with a congo of rice priced at 2000 naira and a dollar exchange rate of 1500 naira, where are we truly headed?
You might need to check again. The doctor who will prescribe malaria drugs will probably be in Toronto the next morning. Do our leaders even comprehend the path they’re leading us on?
Many Nigerians, yourself included, have reached the conclusion that our lives can only truly begin at the airport—one hand clutching our suitcase, the other gripping our visas.
As you wait in line, contemplating your journey, you realise that the issue of brain drain must be addressed, as it threatens to deplete the nation of its talented individuals. Nigeria’s potential for greatness lies not only in those who leave but in the collective effort to create a conducive environment for success at home. It’s time we envision a Nigeria where every citizen can thrive and no one is left behind.
So you tell the American ambassador’s representative when it’s your turn that you’re in the ocean. You will stay. You will fight. The lady’s face turns red, and you leave, with everyone looking at you in pity.
“Na village people,” you hear someone whisper, but you don’t stop.
You walk out of the complex and you take the next plane back to Ibadan.

How to roll a joint: seven steps to self-destruction,https://punocracy.com/how-to-roll-a-joint-seven-steps-to-self-destruction/,2024-06-29T11:12:42+01:00,"By:Obafemi Shedrach
A man is nothing if not a cloak of conscience and consciousness. At least, that’s what makes him different from the beast of the field. It means he has a clear mind and can make conscious decisions. Well, until he gets inundated by the white substance. Then, he loses consciousness and conscience and becomes no different from the crawling beasts.
But I digress; today, I will teach you, in seven steps, how to roll a “joint”. Don’t ask how I learned how to do that. In fact, I don’t know exactly, but I am sure of how to self-destruct, and I will teach you.
To get on the journey towards societal oblivion, you need your materials ready and available. You’ll need some rolling papers, a filter tip, and the most important ingredient: your preferred substance. Now, I don’t know where to get them, but I can point you to people you can get them from. I see them rolling in the gutters (I mean, “roll a joint to roll in a gutter” doesn’t exactly sound bad); some are chained to beds in the hospital; in fact, I saw one roaming the streets fully unconscious, yet mobile. Haq! Before I forget, you will need a matchbox or a lighter just to lighten the spark of your downward spiral.
Now, you need to find your way from the judging eyes of the society. You know they can be a bit nosey. They want to tell you the dangers of drug abuse, such as psychosis, depression, addiction, poor performance, and, in extreme cases, death. I mean, arecent studyshows that 70 per cent of young people with substance use mentioned in their health data also had a record relating to mental illness, but really, that doesn’t concern you. You and I know they will not mind their business, so choose a place where your poor life choices will go unnoticed, like your parent’s basement or a dimly lit alley, or maybe in the company of friends-in-crime. How else will they know you are a “responsible adult” if you are not indulging in activities that could lead to health issues, legal problems, and social alienation?
I had an experience a while back in my place of work. By the way, did I tell you I work in a hospital? Yes, I do. So, I see people brought in daily due to drug overdose and substance abuse. The experience I had was a patient who had downed seven cans of bullet, being rushed in. I mean, he was literally almost lifeless. Further questioning revealed that it was a bet amongst friends, and the prize was (just guess) … a whooping sum of ₦5,000. Yes, “Tinubu naira,” not “Biden dollars.” 5k dollars? I might just try it myself. Okay, I wouldn’t. ₦5000, and he was ready to risk his liver, kidneys, and heart; a perfect exchange, in my opinion.
I mean, you are in Nigeria, you can easily get a transplant, and with your minimum wage, you can afford the medical bills. Easy-peasy. Again, I digress! Step 3, yeah? Make the filter.
You need to make the filter tip and roll it carefully into a tight cylinder. It serves as a gateway to coughs, chronic bronchitis, and the inevitable lung damage. Okay, there could be some moments of “Why did I ever start this?” But then, if you back down now, what will happen to your steeze?
Steeze >>>>>>> Organ damage.
This step is quite easy: spread the substance evenly on the rolling paper. Someone said it must be even to get the false layer of hope and disillusionment. Haq! Big grammar. I meant a false layer of high. Well, according to the law of gravity, anything that goes up must surely come down. When you attain that high, you are sure to come down with mental disorders and organ damage, amongst others. But who cares, you’re here for a good time, not a long time.
Now, in life, precision is key. What is worth doing at all, they say, is worth doing well. Ensure the paper is well packed. Then, carefully lick the strip and seal it with saliva. Now that I think about it, isn’t it interesting that you could seal your journey to destruction with just saliva?
The most important step is here: Light it up! This is the peak of it. Light it up and take a puff. I know you plan to stop just after the first puff. Inhale deeply, letting the smoke fill your lungs and your mind with delusions of grandeur. Now, that feels good. Maybe one more puff, and you ditch it. However, have you actually come this far for just two puffs? Nah! Let it not be heard. Take one more puff. And then one more. And one more! Okay, why not just finish this and then stop afterwards? The sense of misguided pride you get is second to none; even though your ambition, productivity, and clear-headedness may dissipate into the air along with the smoke from the joint, nobody cares.
Like everything, the moment of euphoria is ephemeral. Anxiety is creeping in. Your mind is getting foggy. Your mind is clear. No, not clear mind. I mean, your mind is completely void. You see clearly. Clearly enough to see your friends hailing you. Sadly, not clearly enough to see that your body is getting damaged. Or that your parents are in agony watching you puff your future away. Enjoy the false sense of creativity and profound thoughts you won’t remember tomorrow.
Now, the key to sealing your destiny lies in repeating this process until you sufficiently numb yourself to the world around you. With each puff, you bid goodbye to opportunities, relationships, and overall health.
See that! If you have followed these steps religiously, you are definitely a stone’s throw from destruction. I’d say safe journey, but you and I know there is nothing safe about this journey. So, enjoy the ride!
NB: Substance abuse is a menace that negatively impacts every area of your life. If you have not engaged in this dangerous activity, steer clear of it. Invest your time in things that can help and improve your life. And don’t mingle with friends that do. If you are into it, the best time to stop and seek help was yesterday. The next best time is today. Seek help! It is not over for you.

Nigeria as a dilapidated Micra cab,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-as-a-dilapidated-micra-cab/,2024-06-29T10:18:52+01:00,"By:Okwuasaba Flourish
This development crisis situation that still confronts many African countries today has four dimensions: bad driver, bad vehicle, bad road conditions, bad strategy —and angry passengers. Fixing one without the others would make little difference to the development journey.
The story you’re about to read is an absurd metaphorical one. If you hope to read a happily-ever-after story, it’s not here. Maybe elsewhere when youjapa. However, if you’re interested in stories about corruption overload, poverty cases, hungry and angry Nigerians and one irrelevant bill, then go on.
I am Kuru and it is my sad duty to narrate this ridiculous story as a fellow passenger and participant in theshege.
The Nigeria of today is an accumulation of various events and tragedies that have made it what it is. The country can be likened to a dilapidated Micra cab. The type that Ibadan drivers lord over and is riddled with faults. The driver of this beat-up car calls himself Jagaban, and his number plate reads “8-point agenda”. His passengers call him “Man of the Pee Poo”. His fellow friends in the business call him “Asiwaju”. Others simply refer to him as “City Boy”. The driver is our beloved leader.
Our leader–Man of the Pee Poo pulls out the car manual, but it’s written in Chinese, a language he can’t comprehend except for the “one-year warranty” part. So he begins the journey with the words, “We go run am.” But not long after, a stench reaches the noses of the passengers. With concern, they suggest he hand over to Obi, a more qualified driver, as the journey is too far. However, he dismisses their worries with a nonchalant, “Just get me quality diapers.”
The heat makes the stench unbearable and to make matters worse, the air conditioning system is malfunctioning. Man of the Pee Poo tries to balance the wheel but fails at it. The headlights are epileptic and dim throughout the dark night (epileptic power supply). The driver increases the fare in a bid to get more fuel and adjust the electric panel (fuel subsidy and electricity tariffs). The brakes are not functioning, and the shock absorbers are down (checks and balances). The horn produces a shrill sound (Nigerian press), and the mirror is riddled with cracks, but this is just the beginning.
The bumper is disfigured, the windscreen is fogged up, the wipers are useless, the radiator fan is defunct, and the cooling system is leaking profusely. The smoke-belching junker pushes forward a coffin filled with old naira notes that a former driver, Abacha, had left there. The passengers are oblivious to its existence.
As Africans are wont to lament, we struggle very hard to remove one cockroach from power and the next rat comes to do the same thing! Haba!
This ride leaves a trail of recurring problems revolving around fuel subsidies, electricity tariffs, a suspended cyber security levy, a pending minimum wage bill, tribalism, foreign debt, a crumbling educational system, a devalued naira, and a weak passport.
The battery begins to touch, and Man of the Pee Poo attempts to flag down a passing vehicle for assistance, but the road is quiet.
It is customary for two passengers to sit in the front seat so the driver can profit more, even though it is at the expense of the passengers’ comfort. So one of the passengers in the front seat complains, “Mallam, shift, this place is too tight.”
“Why I go shift? I dey sit on top brake,” the mallam responds.
Another passenger from the back supports the Mallam and says, “Ngbati wan ya sef, no one here is comfortable.”
Ngbati, frustrated, disembarks to join another British vehicle but is met with disdainful looks and the words, “Aren’t you from that tattered vehicle? Please scoot over; I don’t want any of your colour on me”, said in a beautiful British accent.
Another Ngbati, still in the rugged vehicle, pleads, “Please, I can only pay half of the exorbitant fare.”
Man of the Pee Poo has a listening ear, so he responds that it’s all part of the austerity measures and nothing can be done since his debts need to be paid.
A street vendor advertises a flying broom that will “carry you to the abroad”. The Mallam attempts to say, “Aba boys at work,” but is abruptly interrupted by the car stereo blaring, “Nigeria, we hail thee!” Ironically, it seems the only thing functioning perfectly in this dilapidated vehicle is the stereo system.

The ant colony—or political parables about a certain country,https://punocracy.com/the-ant-colony-or-political-parables-about-a-certain-country/,2024-06-01T11:20:17+01:00,"By:Adewuyi Taiwo
Imagine this country’s flag is a field of green corn, white cotton, and succulent grass. Ants scurry over the soil of their fatherland, everybody in their castes. The soldier ants obey the whim of the new colony-al masters by harassing everyone who doesn’t quietly do his work but chitters like a cricket about the national strikes. The crickets are treated like criminals for blaspheming the democratic gods.
The worker ants are those government workers commuting between anthills of metal and glass, wearing threadbare suits and those fancy puppy leashes they call ties. They weightlift crumbs of the national cake bigger than their own financial size to pay homage to the colonial masters before ultimately falling apart, appendage by appendage, to be sustained only by the trickle of nutrients we call pension.
As a journalist in this field of corn, you dare not preach good governance and the gospel of political repentance anywhere because some politician-pharisees can bear false witness against you. Before you know it, you are carrying the cross of the country’s corruption and all its democratic sins. The police will mock you by calling you the King of the Nigerian Jews and spit on you. Your sweat will flow like blood, or your blood like sweat. And you will be brought before many Pontius Pilates who adorn their heads with blond wigs and wear black coats. They have bowls of water beside them to wash their hands off your case and wash it again to start eating their rewards for not letting you go.
But don’t you think that last statement reminds you of those pre-Independence Moseses who told the white Pharaohs to let their people go? It shocks you deeply that even in the Promised Land, your people are still enslaved to new Pharaohs who sprouted from among them. They will nail you to many crosses on social me,dia but your reputation will not rise again on the third day or the fourth or the fifth because, number one, they will never stop killing your social image. In fact, don’t be surprised if you take the blame for a political Barabbas. Number two, you don’t have a Godfather, a political equivalent of God the Father, to resurrect you.
The scarecrow also resembles a man on the cross, the only distinction being that a scarecrow is often a stuffed humanoid used to scare away the crowd of crows that would reduce the field to shreds of leaves if left unchecked. But what if the crows are lawful citizens and the scarecrow’s hands are each made of a single yet deadly rifle? This nation is full of plot twists, and it often feels like we are watching a suspenseful, funny, yet tragic thriller with our corneas being the huge cinema screens. Mind you, we can’t afford popcorn, not while the dollar is flapping its papery wings towards the horizon of the future, and our naira is crawling like a crippled snail.
If we move on to that part of the flag that is like cotton, we will see that it is actually made of the white wool of millions of sheep following a shepherd who promised in his campaign to lead them to greener pastures. Sadly, the country’s pastures are not as green as the flag, and one can think of this country as a green wilderness if there can ever be such a thing.
It is also quite unfortunate that the shepherd has a wolfish face, replete with cold, cunning eyes, black fur and fangs, and the sheep are only safe inside his stomach. But like sheep destined for the slaughter, they stand before the shepherd and say nothing because they understand they are living sacrifices for this country.
Our fathers who art in Aso Rock.
Hallowed be your names (despite your glaring acts of corruption).
Thy will be done in this country as it is done in your hearts …
Now, what I am about to tell you may sound like a scene from a horror movie or one of the bizarre episodic dreams we have when we are feverish, but imagine that the eagle in our coat of arms suddenly becomes animated and flies off the shield on which it has rested for so many years. It then goes around pecking into the basket on every Nigerian head, like the dream of the Egyptian baker or pecking our eyes like almond fruits.
Have you ever seen large women pounding yams in a mortar? Now imagine the horses in the coat of arms trampling a man into paste. Gory, right? Many have had their rights trampled upon by these horses. But we have gotten used to it. We have gotten used to the bloodless coups that take place during our ridiculous elections, and every driver remembers to drop a tiny crumb of money for the military hounds while plying the federal roads lest they bark at him and beat his car up or change the topography of his face and he becomes cured of his boldness.
There are still others in the same sinking boats with us who would rather fill their bellies with the most minuscule crumbs of the national cake than tell the truth. And like they say, table manners demand that they cannot talk against the prevalent corruption while eating.
What, then, shall we do?
I, personally, cannot make a proposition as to how we can make this nation better. Besides, I wouldn’t dare say much because, like they say, there is freedom of speech, but the freedom after speech is not guaranteed. But I can admonish us to persevere until our heads go bald. And not to forget to recite the pledge like a mantra.
It helps, I think.

where I come from
our mothers change prayer houses like fancy clothes
and fathers sometimes ain’t so spiritual
because it’s a woman’s duty to pray for them
They call them a praying mother or wife
and my people suffer from a common sense pandemic
they have grown fond of the messengers and ignored the message
partially deaf to hear from the maker of the universe but worship his servants
with their tongues, they would make holy excuses for these deities to exonerate their assorted shortcomings
and crucify anyone who dared tender allegations
because…
clerics are like polaroid portraits
affiliated to a loyal congregation
who censor their characters and flicker between programmes
seeking revival of seasons
and vague expectations
my people love God but can’t give him a head start in their long-distance relationship
so they fast-track answers from heaven through his clergy
because God must be sluggish
desperate to genuflect in benediction to any
but their source
right here,
intercession is a daily bread
where worshippers outsource prayer to delegates
because they are short-sighted to see God
in the wee hours,
households would dabble in forced devotions
and fabricate reasons to profess fire and brimstone on their enemies
a wholesome lip service to appease their creator
religion is a screenplay where I come from
a comic relief featuring fake prophecies and a stampede of the highest bidders
sit back for a thriller
today,
a cleric would scourge his followers with empty threats and psychological blackmail
at dusk,
a broken fellowship would take praying lessons
beseech heaven for miracles
and clap their petitions into deafening applause
my people have an obsession with miracles
tossed by every wind of doctrine
they belittle God
but expect multiple folds when they have not planted any seed
sacrifice their salaries on the altar of extortion
sponsor a pocket-friendly homily
and languish in poverty
next door,
a crowd would chatter supplications to shake the rooftop of their dome
dent their image
and cause neighbours to scoff
tonight,
a cleric would serve half-baked sermons to hungry worshippers with voracious appetites
who scramble for crumbs
spark pandemonium on the pulpit
sign an autograph on the lips of intercessors
and watch them fidget
wallow in guilt
and chirp in loud tones
my people cannot have a profound dialogue with divinity
but can lift jars of requests
and offer pockets of condensed sanctimony
in slaughterhouses of prayer
these brethren would instigate a catastrophic public acclaim
with other denominations
inflecting a noisy tragedy on the streets
to compete with fervour
for a slot at the grand finale in heaven

This government will favour me and my family,https://punocracy.com/this-government-will-favour-me-and-my-family/,2024-05-18T11:23:45+01:00,"Wole has never cared much for politics. But when Bunu ran for president, he whipped out his voice and dedicated every second of his Internet hours to support his campaign. He doesn’t know about the man’s ethics or competence, but he’s from his side of the map and his neighbour’s in-law’s cousin used to work at his company. So you never know.
Wole was sure that he stood a better chance of benefitting from a political windfall with Bunu in power than any of his opponents. When he finally won the elections, one slogan rang in his mind so often it had to be true: “this government will favour me and my family”. But as days turned into weeks and weeks into months, that slogan started to take on a life of its own, increasing in length and locking onto one condition after another.
Aunty Busola was the first to go.
There was a stampede at the stadium. Women leaders of the ruling party had organised a pro-Bunu rally and they had started sharing cash and cartons of indomie. Some of the people had not tasted noodles in months. Three people were knocked unconscious that day as the crowd swarmed towards the goodies like bees. One of them recovered. Busola wasn’t so lucky.
“Well,” Wole thought, “this government will favour me and my family, except Aunty Busola.”
But the tragedies poured like they had been edged by providence for far too long and suddenly had permission to come. Brother Lekan was abducted alongside his wife and two children. After the ransom was beaten down to N20 million and delivered two weeks later, thanks to at least donations from far and wide and at least four loan apps, only the wife and children returned. They said Brother Lekan found a way to untie himself in the thick of captivity and bolted, leaving his family behind. He couldn’t run faster than the bullet. He was buried there in the forest.
“Well,” Wole said, “this government will favour me and my family, except Aunty Busola and Brother Lekan.”
Then, one morning, he received a call from a strange number. “Are you Adewole?” the person asked. “Do you know any young man in his late twenties who lives in Lagos and wears a beard and locks?” That must be Moses, he replied. “Why are you asking?” Moses is dead, the strange number said. He jumped into the lagoon. By the time help got to him, it was too late. Wole was one of the last people he called and since there’s a prefix of “bro” next to his name, they figured they must be family. Moses studied Petroleum Engineering, graduated seven years ago, and has been unemployed for longer than he has been extremely underemployed.
Death seemed to have a yawning appetite because the tragedies kept pouring. Armed robberies. Road accidents. Starving to death while crossing the desert into Europe. Extrajudicial killing. Judicial killing. Jungle justice.
One day, when Wole walked away from the fresh grave of his last family, his heart was heavy with grief and his eyes were laced with tears. Then he checked his phone. Bunu had just announced that he was giving trillions of naira in grants and loans to business owners to breathe life into the economy. Each beneficiary could get up to ₦5 million. By a stroke of luck, Wole’s neighbour, whose in-law’s cousin used to work for one of Bunu’s companies, posted on WhatsApp that he had access to a few slots. All you had to do was pay him ₦500,000 for his troubles. This was his chance.
Wole sold his washed-up generator, which he could not afford to fuel anyway, and scraped up the rest of the money by delaying paying his rent. As he transferred the money, he reluctantly muttered to himself, “This government will favour me …”"
The lion and the billions,https://punocracy.com/the-lion-and-the-billions/,2024-05-18T10:40:53+01:00,"By:Abdulrahman Yahaya
In my first-year literature class at the university, we read Professor Wole Soyinka’sThe Lion And The Jewel, a rich play about a village head and a village belle. Notorious for marrying regularly, Baroka, the Baale of Ilujinle, is set to take another wife and he has settled for the most beautiful girl in Ilujinle, Sidi, the village Jewel. But Sidi will not stoop low to marry Baroka, thescourge of women, the old fox. She will not do that to herself, especially now that the white man has captured her beauty, and she will soon be known beyond Ilujinle. The young girl dismissed the lion’s proposal with disdain.
But what the lion wants, the lion must get, come what may. Isn’t that what lionhood is about? Nobody denies the lion its food, lest that person becomes the food for the lion. But Baroka was a different lion. Though as deadly as all lions, Baroka does not have to run to eat. Where wisdom brings you food, what do you need speed for? With his wisdom, Baroka lured Sidi into his den and in no time, she was back home, preparing to be his latest wife. You will get the details of how he did that in the play. Yes. Go read it.
That’s the Lion of Ilujinle. Let’s talk about the Lion of Kogi, a self-acclaimed White Lion. Like Baroka, the Lion of Kogi did not have to run at full speed to have access to the billions in the coffers of his state. It was given to him on a gold platter. In what will remain one of the most controversial political verdicts in Nigeria, Yahaya Adoza Bello was declared governor-elect in an election he wasn’t a flagbearer. He became governor by virtue of being first runner-up in the APC primaries, benefiting from the shocking death of the party’s candidate, Abubakar Audu, on the day of the election.
A legal declaration unearthed Bello and the people of Kogi would be introduced to the “White Lion”. They would soon learn how leadership worked in the jungle. But in the meantime, Kogites and Nigerians celebrated the emergence of a youth. Bello was 41, so it was expected that he was coming with something different from what the oldies had been doing. They thought the one who would show the importance of youthful exuberance in leadership had finally arrived. The first of many to come.
It is important to note that this was what they thought of Yahaya Bello; he did not ask for the high expectations. Moreover, he had his own plans. He was a lion, and it was now time for the people to feel the unique way a lion rules his kingdom. The people must shiver down their spines whenever he roars. Nobody, be they a mere voter or traditional ruler, must question the lion. That you work for 31 days doesn’t guarantee you pay at the end of the month. You get paid when the lion feels up to it. After all, it is the lion that provides you security; that much should be enough.
The Lion assumed his throne, and in no time, Kogites felt the scorching change in the Jungle. Civil servants queued more for screenings than they did in banks. Salary came like the Ramadan crescent, once after eight months. Teachers couldn’t teach because their mouths did more yawning than speaking. Doctors fled for greener pastures. The Lion couldn’t care less. He double-dared anybody to protest. Who could be fit enough to protest? The lion roared everybody to silence.
It will be over in four years, the people spoke hopefully. He will be voted out. He is a disgrace to the youth. The people barked despite themselves. But the lion couldn’t be bothered. He was governor and would be for eight years. He had every means at his disposal. He would simply pay the wolves to cause uproar and see how other animals would scurry into the woods on election day. The lion knew his onions. He was back again for another four years. Civil servants wept silently, cursed in their dark corners as the lion celebrated.
Four years later, the lion delivered even better. This time, there were no dogs. “Let them vote. We can just write a favourable result.” The people voted, and the Lion wrote the results for them. His stooge emerged, and yet again, the lion survived a supposed democratic process, once again roaring everybody to silence. That is the lion of Kogi!
Strangely, recent developments have cast doubt on the bravery of the once-feared lion. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) beckoned on the former governor to explain how ₦82 billion was looted. In a character unexpected of a lion, he has been hiding in the woods. The Lion, who is renowned for hunting, is now being hunted. How the might has fallen!
One would have expected the Lion to honour the invitation of whoever dared to invite him. One would expect the lion to look anybody straight in the eyes and say: “Yes. I am the White Lion, the best and the most feared Governor Kogi state has ever seen. What is it you want from me? How dare you invite me? Do you not know what the consequences of your actions are? I have people in high places that will deal with you. Oh, you allowed that fair lady to put you up to this? Or is it that antelope from the East? Go tell them that I am the White Lion! So what if I didn’t pay civil servants? Did the former governors pay? Excuse me, please. I have to address the press!”
That is how the lion of Kogi is expected to have replied. But now we don’t know what has incarcerated the lion. The lion no longer roars. We do not see him even. What we see is a portrait of him being shared online, wanted for looting.
This reminds me of the character Tyrion Lannister of Game of Thrones. He said, “A man who must say I am King is no true King.” The former governor was no lion. We were scammed.

Becoming a bus conductor in Nigeria 101,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-bus-conductor-in-nigeria-101/,2024-03-23T10:53:09+01:00,"By:Faith Ekekwe
Just in case you wake up and the unemployment rate has you considering options,conducteeringis a rather lucrative endeavour. You might be worried about getting harassed by tax collectors (otherwise known asagberos), but this can be managed. I mean, what is small harassment that you can’t endure at maybe 50 different bus stops?
Here are some tips if you are ready for this exciting venture:
A thunderous voice:If you don’t have this important tool, how do you hope to attract people from their homes into your vehicle? Mind you, beyond loud, it must also sound capable. People want to be sure that the people ferrying them to their place of work or the places they need to get to are pros in the game.
A perpetually angry look:Imagine getting to the bus stop and seeing a conductor smiling at you.Ni kini? Kiloshele gan gan?This career path you have chosen doesn’t have smiling as part of its job description. I mean, take a look at the economy. What is funny about it?
Scars:These are your souvenirs from battles lost and won. How are people supposed to be convinced of your fitness for this job role if they can’t easily see proof of your former Viking career?
Ability to get angry:To go along with the no-smiling policy is the ability to get angry. Get angry for no reason. Raise that thunderous voice at a passenger who is refusing to adjust. Get angry at the passenger who is asking to pay ₦500 from Iyana Ipaja to Yaba. Snap at the nagging passengers and even the smiling ones. Again, what exactly is funny about this economy?
Red murderous eyes:Ever looked at someone’s eyes and just shivered? That’s what I am talking about. This can easily be induced with a quick bottle of Chelsea gin.
Hold out giving change:Where does it happen that you give out money to a conductor and you get your change immediately? Kindly note that you must hold on to a passenger’s change and only let go of it when they won’t stop pestering you or they are very close to their stop.
Mad argumentative skills:This is particularly useful when negotiating, a vital survival skill everyone should possess. With it, you can exhaust passengers. You definitely don’t want to be the one who gives up in an argument.
Looking forward to hearing how helpful these tips are. Do not forget to give some feedback.With love and hope that you thrive at this job.

Those who do not see the need for timely commendations of praiseworthy leaders. If we do not thank exemplary leaders like Abacha, Buhari, Tinubu, etc, who will? The Americans can’t do this for us when we are the core and direct beneficiaries of the comfortable and stabilised economy — though, in many ways, foreigners are also benefiting from the Nigerian economy. God bless Tinubu!
This short work is written in the appraisal of a man who has proven himself to be the best we may have ever thought of. A man who has shown that old age is unarguably an advantage in enviable leadership. The older, the better for the people and the policies formulated.
His Excellency Bola Tinubu became the best option during the campaigning period the moment he screamed ‘Emi lokan!’ We just knew he was the one for the job; thus, the reason we went out en masse to vote him into power, leaving other top candidates with one or two votes.
Remember that during his days as Governor, he bought all the lands with his hard-earned money, built houses, raised indigenous companies, and singlehandedly funded the entire development of the place known as Lagos. From his influence and authority, Lagos was made the Federal Capital Territory. He made Lagos what it is today. The state must, as a matter of appreciation, be named after him.
Nigeria is gradually becoming a replica of what he made Lagos to be. He has wielded his leadership powers, adeptness and mastery to ensure the workability of everything in the country. This is well evidenced in the Naira-dollar exchange rate, which has improved prices of everything — except for employee salaries, which have to remain static, or else employers will die.
The higher the prices of goods, the better the economy of the nation. The higher the fuel price, the richer the masses (as a matter of fact, the fuel subsidy removal was timely). A bag of cement is reportedly sold at around N15k, only N15k o! We are even lucky it hasn’t increased to N50k yet.
Prices of foodstuffs have mildly skyrocketed, and so? Are the Senators complaining? Are the Ministers lamenting? If they aren’t, then why should you? If things are hard, the most affected are the first-class citizens. Politicians are the most concerned because the hardship they face to satisfy the common man is astounding. They dump their children in public schools and ensure they donate and distribute sewing machines, clippers, exercise books, bags of rice, and so on to Nigerians, especially during electioneering, to alleviate their penury. God bless them!
Some Nigerians just lack patience.  Sometimes, inflation is a perfect way to boost the economy. Nigeria’s economy is not dwindling but rather growing rapidly and going at a rattling pace. Hallelujah! (Note: The nation’s economy is the politician’s account status. I’m aware most students aren’t taught this in school.)
I’ve read people make comments like, “The man who built Lagos is destroying Nigeria.” Such antithetical, false, and careless statements should be ignored. It could make one think that things are not going well in the country, and it might as well paint the whole issue to look as though people are suffering.
Tinubu is building Nigeria, though many of us may not be singing his appraisals to avoid complacency on his side. Frankly speaking, his messianic moves cannot go unnoticed.
The hope of an average Nigerian is renewed daily, courtesy of our saviour, Tinubu. We are a people of hope. Besides,‘e go better’and‘this government go favour me and my family.’Let’s give him a little more time. Say the next seven years. Rome was not built in a day.
It shall not be well with those who consider the previous and current tenure abhorrent and appalling. These ones are the real attention seekers and bad belles. And even if this administration happens to be the worst democratic administration, what is your concern? Hasn’t Seyi, Jagaban’s son, admonished everyone to endure the small hardship? What else would one expect him to do? The dad is working round the clock — tirelessly for continuous growth — whilst the son is admonishing.
The present administration’s impact on people is impeccable and conspicuously beautiful. Indeed, it was a good transition of power — from Bubu to Jagaban. And as promised, we are experiencing a perfect continuum. Buhari’s mandate was to purge the country of corruption, which he did successfully till Nigeria became the most sanitised country in Africa and second in the world. A leader who cleansed his cabinet of corruption and thereby revealed to the world how possible it was to have corrupt-free leaders during his time. Now, we have a renewer of dead and lost hope leading the nation. How luckier can a country get? Hence, the core reason our jaws are filled withthank yous. Indeed, Tinubu’s administration is the best thing that can ever happen to you.
I know those in the diaspora must be really jealous. They wish they never left the country.
P.S.Nigerian leaders should organise masterclasses for world leaders on Leadership, development, and strategy. There’s provision for this. Ibom International Worship Centre can serve as a venue for the masterclasses. Some can join virtually now that we have the best network coverage in Nigeria across all service providers, especiallyEtisalat and Globacom."
"In Nigeria, prayer is the opium of the poor",https://punocracy.com/in-nigeria-prayer-is-the-opium-of-the-poor/,2024-03-02T08:47:49+01:00,"By:Avami
It sounded like I had heard this before, but it was still profound to me the first time I heard my lecturer say it.
Granted, in his next breath he went on to shame his wife for spending his money on more clothes than she could fit into a school bag so maybe he isn’t the most reasonable person to be getting advice from but that saying stuck with me.
Nigeria is the poor, and prayer is our opium; what more needs to be said? We hold on to the belief that prayer alone without action will work. To us, prayer is our action.
When things get worse, we don’t rise to the occasion and actively seek a solution, like all God-fearing people we only raise the volume of our prayers.
I used to take pride in the fact that Nigerians are adaptable people. Whatever comes our way, we easily adapt to and overcome it. But I was wrong, what we do isn’t adapting.
When animals adapt, they adjust themselves to their condition in order to thrive in it, but also not to fall victim to those same circumstances again. But we Nigerians fall victim again and again and again to those same conditions.
Maybe we did adapt, adapt our bodies to become comfortable with mediocrity, that is. When the economy drops, we pray and lament about how things used to be better; when the economy drops even further, we pray even more and continue lamenting about how things used to be better.
The formula clearly isn’t working, but we stick to it. Adaptation involves going through a sequence of changes till you find the one that best suits your optimal survival in a situation.
We keep adhering to the same process until maybe, probably, our situation becomes better and then we say, ‘See? It worked, after all. Shame to all naysayers.’ Even though it took nine decades of toiling in severe hardship. Even though it happened because of those naysayers and not despite them.
Then again, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride. If the poor thought they only had opium, what else are they to do except become addicted to it?

Naira’s journey through birthday wish lists and lace wigs,https://punocracy.com/nairas-journey-through-birthday-wish-lists-and-lace-wigs/,2024-02-03T10:58:08+01:00,"By:Esther Omoye
Over time, Nigerians have wondered whether or not the currency collapse was more than it seemed. This became more apparent as the national economic landscape changed since the free fall of the naira. With so many companies fleeing the country over the last year, worries keep rising as we mourn the economic powerhouse that Nigeria used to be.
The currency crisis in Nigeria is just like the biblical flood but without Noah’s ark.
The root of any collapse stems from a lack of faith in the usefulness or stability of the currency to serve as an effective store of value or medium of exchange. Yes, you read right. Naira is that babe with seven change notes but with little to no confidence. This can be brought about through improper valuations, monetary policy, chronic low growth, and Nigeria’s not-so-pleasant close cousin, inflation.
It is important to know that Naira isn’t an international reserve currency, too, and that’s because it is not a theoretical alternative for the rest of the world. Yes, you read right again. Naira is an inherently monogamous babe, but her undefined relationships with Dollars and Pounds give her anxiety and eventually build resentment, which every Nigerian is suffering for now. For example, if one Naira can be exchanged for one U.S. Dollar, the currencies are described as being at parity. If the exchange rate moves and one dollar can now be exchanged for ₦890, the naira has lost value relative to its U.S. counterpart and has, therefore, depreciated against it.
The Central Bank of Nigeria floated the national currency in June 2023. Its only reason was to boost the liquidity of the currency in the foreign exchange market. But it seems the only liquidity being boosted is the already eroded standard of living in Nigeria—the rich are crying, the middle class has been evaporated with the carbon emissions of this depreciation, the poor are getting poorer, and the Dollar is asking for more from Naira.
Naira barreled toward a 51.21% loss on Tuesday in what would be its worst performance ever. The naira index was on a tear between early December and mid-January, surging by more than 7% as a slew of negative economic data continued to fuel worries that the exchange rates might remain high.
A limper naira is bad news for Nigerian consumers, who can expect to pay more for imported goods and reduce their purchasing power. A weakening currency makes Nigeria a little bit poorer because they pay more for the goods they import and get less for the goods they export.
In recent times, if you think far enough as a Nigerian, you could cry so hard that there’d be nothing left in you, like how the wind shakes a tree in a whirlpool until every part of it is run through with wind. There isn’t even enough to cheer Nigerians into their no-gree-for-anybodi-energy anymore. It feels like the harmattan came running, drying all of the elasticity that Nigerians are known for, or this might just be the year where their backs are finally broken. We don bow for the results, Burna.
The indomie generation can no longer afford indomie. The millennials reminisce about when the naira used to be ₦130 against the dollar in 2004. A UK-used iPhone XR is ₦310k, ₦140k more than its price in 2021. Nigerian Twitter is cheering the Naira on to fight back as if this is another AFCON match against Cameroon, and economic analysts are backtracking from their favourable predictions of the Mayday policy.
As if this isn’t enough, ourcity boyis perfectly tucked away sipping French wine, stepping us up with his dance moves, and receiving congratulatory handshakes like Osimhen after a well-played match in his presidential staycation villa. It will always be our job to hold our leaders accountable, especially during a time when we might finally speedily grow into a national starvation routine. But Arise TV always comes to the rescue, doesn’t it? Early to bed, early to rise indeed.
There has never been a time that the TV station missed a chance to be part of a political discourse or felt discouraged from extensively discussing the country’s raging problems. With its most recent, the station had the host and producer of their Global Business Report, Aruoture Rotus Oddiri, extensively spoke about the devaluation over a banner headline that read like a political manifesto: PWC HIGHLIGHTS 2023 NAIRA DEVALUATION. The devil works hard, but partisan politics in Nigerian media houses is a 9-5er.
The analyst started by talking about the reactions to the increasing exchange rate and stressed that demand was the main reason for the hike. He continues by saying, “I have three examples,” in a voice that one could practically imagine the chart and statistics that should come next, but a screenshot of a random WhatsApp birthday wishlist follows.
The wishlist contains seven items, but he focuses on the first and second items: money and human hair. He ends with the statement, “You can attest that the demand for human hair by Nigerian women in particular … If you look at the market for glueless wigs, according to Allied Market Research, it is a $719.2m market.”
He continues with so much precision that I wouldn’t be surprised if he sits on the right-hand side of a presidential candidate come 2027 as a finance manager: “It is projected to reach about $1.3bn by 2023.”
He further adjusts his voice to its proper stance of textbook government apologism: “Here in Nigeria, despite the devaluation of the currency, demands for wigs are extremely high.” “The Ayos, the Seyitans, Hauwa Mukans, and everybody else that uses these wigs, they are imported and not made here.”
Key takeaways from Rotus’ analysis
1. The demand for money on birthday wish lists is one of the top applicable examples of why the exchange rate keeps trying to stifle the breath out of Nigerians.
2. The importation of lace wigs is also one of the top examples of why the exchange rate keeps whipping the heads of Nigerians back and forth.
The applicability of his analysis
One, since the Emefiele-cash-scarcity-tenure, Nigerians almost buy naira to have access to naira. While Rotus is correct that demand often affects exchange rates, it feels very lazy that he uses the request for money on a birthday wishlist as one of the top examples of why the exchange rate keeps skyrocketing like it has to tower Lagos house rents.
His analysis is devoid of depth and almost seems like a rush through the hustle and bustle of Lagos. There is no mention of the politics behind the new naira design and its effects on the accessibility of money. He had also seemingly forgotten the fact that Nigeria is a public-debt-friendly country, a renowned onigbese. Large debts encourage inflation, and if inflation is high, the debt will be serviced and ultimately paid off with cheaper real dollars in the future.
In the worst-case scenario, a government may print money to pay part of a large debt, but increasing the money supply inevitably causes inflation. So, when the CBN recently announced that it has ₦3.4 trillion in circulation and blamed hoarding for scarcity, the question to be asked isn’t who are the people behind this hoarding but, as a country, how do we handle our international dollar obligations and financial transactions? No, I’m not talking about the Grenada birthday bashes, the COP 28 or presidential staycations.
Second, Naira has never had a fixed rate; it has always been a freelancer, prancing around everywhere, looking for its next big byline: “Nigeria Naira Records an all-time low, with ₦1,490 to 1 USD.”
Typically, a country with a consistently high inflation rate, like Nigeria, exhibits a depreciating currency value as its purchasing power decreases relative to other currencies. For example, let’s say that lace wigs are the only product on the market and Nigeria imports more lace wigs from China than it exports. As a result, it needs to buy more relative dollars to naira sold. Nigeria’s demand for dollars outstrips China’s demand for naira, quite alright.
The market for lace wigs in Nigeria cannot be compared or placed in the top 10 imports. So why is the demand for lace wigs a feasible example for such a critical analysis of the naira devaluation? Nigeria isn’t even listed as the country with the most importation of lace wigs, and most of Rotus’ analysis is on the hair market generally across Africa and the world.
Nigeria’s top 10 imports
1. Mineral fuels, including oil: US$23.9 billion (39.6% of total imports)
2. Machinery, including computers: $6.9 billion (11.4%)
3. Electrical machinery, equipment: $3.5 billion (5.7%)
4. Vehicles: $3.3 billion (5.4%)
5. Plastics, plastic articles: $2.32 billion (3.8%)
6. Cereals: $2.27 billion (3.8%)
7.Optical, technical, and medical apparatus: $1.2 billion (2%)
8.Pharmaceuticals: $1.1 billion (1.7%)
9. Other chemical goods: $1.03 billion (1.7%)
10. Organic chemicals: $1.02 billion (1.7%)
Two examples Rotus could have used
1. Debt servicing: As I stated earlier, Nigeria is a debt-friendly country, and our debt servicing cost has increased by 55.71 per cent to ₦1. 24tn in three months. We are a truckload ofgbese, and this is truly a deficit for our currency.
2. Forex demand for foreign tuition: Nigeria’s kwashiorkor educational system is part of the reasons Nigerians are travelling abroad to acquire qualitative education. It is also putting so much pressure on the Naira and could have been yet another top credible example.
In critically hard times like this, it is almost impossible to believe that the demand for our own currency and lace wigs on a WhatsApp birthday wish list could be seen as possible reasons for the devaluation. Well, this is Nigeria; the last time, it was seedless grapes, and now it is lace wigs. Perhaps it would be the iPhone next.

A brief list of things to leave behind this year,https://punocracy.com/a-brief-list-of-things-to-leave-behind-this-year/,2024-01-20T10:55:43+01:00,"By:Edwin Mamman
Congratulations! You ended 2023; it didn’t end you. Your village people called several times, but it went to voicemail.
A new year is always ripe with promises of new beginnings and renewed hopes. While most of that is true, something else holds true as well: Real and lasting change begins with you. Like the legend, Michael Jackson sang, “I’m looking at the man in the mirror/ I’m asking him to change his ways.”
If you want to eat from that ripe fruit this year, you must look at yourself in the mirror and face your bullshit. With that said, I will go full ghetto on you from here on and judge you on your bullshit from the past year.
In no particular order, here are some things you should leave in your past:
New Year New Me BS:
So you partied throughout 2023. On 31st December, you attended the New Year’s Eve party instead of the cross-over night in church. Then 7 a.m., the next day, you’re updating your WhatsApp status with ‘new year, new me’. Nigga, please! That update is fake as your girlfriend’s lashes and wig. Drop the act and do better this year. You can start by fixing the mindset that the new year is the only starting point for any life improvement, reinvention or implementation of change in your life.
Giving Politicians Your Mumu Button:
It is a universally accepted truth in this our land that if you give politicians your mumu button, they will press it until it’s broken. Yes, they are shameless like that. And you sef you need to have self-respect. They told you the poor would breathe, and you opened your lungs waah as if that promise itself was oxygen. Now look at you nine months later, suffocating. Our mumu no too much? Politicians are like that demon who will assure you you’re the only flower in his garden. News flash: One flower is not enough to make a garden; e no even reach to make bouquet sef. So this year and beyond, shine your eyes and hide your mumu button; otherwise, dem go press you, press your destiny.
Your ‘Twitter Warrior’ Title:
Oshey o, Elon’s strongest warriors! Twitter generals. Yes o, that hot take you posted in response to a tweet did more damage than the atomic blast in Hiroshima. Oppenheimer is most proud of you. I hope Elon has paid you in dollar bills. Anyway, it’s a new year. Carry that Twitter warrior trophy, put it in a box and stash it in a basement or that ugly wardrobe in your house where things enter and never see the light of day. Let your Twitter fingers rest this year; not every tweet requires your equal and opposing reaction. Yes, you arewoke,we get it, and wisdom is plenty in your head. But sometimes you need to calm down. It’s not always that deep.
Religious Derision and Divisiveness:
“And on this sallah day, not a single sallah meat was given to me.” You posted that update with your full chest but forgot all the times you called your Muslim co-workerAbokior called Alhaji dirty for performing ablution in front of his shop. And you wonder why nobody fucks with you on sallah day. Ehen, and you, that rubbish you posted on Christmas Eve in the wake of the killings in Jos. You also forgot how you spun a narrative on the ongoing Israeli-Palestine issues and tried to cast aspersions to push Christian-Muslim propaganda on your timeline. You even call Christmas a pagan celebration. Still, you’re beefing your Christian neighbour for not sending you chicken and chin-chin on Christmas day. Do better this year.
Japa Syndrome:
You want to japa, but you still think people in the north live in mud houses and move around in wooden carts peddled by cows. You that cannot tell an Australian accent from a British accent; you don’t even know any foreign currencies besides the dollar and pound. What you need is to first of all japa to another part of the country and acclimate to the environment. Learn the people, their cultures and traditions before you think of Canada. Expand your worldview first; abroad does not need you and your shallowness.
Fake Life:
Auntypelebe, we have watched from the mountains and we have seen the 1000 photos of you in front of your neighbour’s polished gate, posing with the same G-wagon. And we’ve about had enough of the pictures of the same food shot from 20 different angles. We are tired. Abeg change restaurants and try new cuisines. Better still, lock your phone in a bank vault and attend at least one book event without a camera following you. Surprise yourself even and ask the panellists an engaging question rather than filming Instagram livestreams while panel discussions are going on. Do better this year.
I have more to say, but my village people are calling again, and I have to hit decline. Peace. Happy New Year!"
Why it is so hard to write about Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/why-it-is-so-hard-to-write-about-nigeria/,2023-12-30T12:25:47+01:00,"By:Abdulrahman Yahaya
I want to write. It has been long since I did, you know, and they say such breaks are not good for the craft. That if you stayed away from writing for a while, the skill would slip away from you gradually. That you would conceive the thought, but to put them on paper would be a Herculean task. So I really want to write. But what’s there to write about?
“Lamentations about our suffering?”
No. Here, we don’t lament. We endure; we suffer and smile because we understand suffering is a global phenomenon. Lamentations are for the weak. Besides, we do not have the luxury of time to lament.
We are busy propping our national grid lest it collapses.  It is not like when it collapses, we would be plunged into darkness. No! We can afford fuel for our generators; ours is the cheapest in the world. But we don’t want to waste our golden resources. A nation that wants to progress must be frugal. We are busy pulling up the Naira too. Lately, the dollar has been bullish, striking down the Naira for all it’s worth. So, you see, we have no time. We must be busy surviving.
“What about a travelogue?”
Travel… what? We don’t write about our travels here in Nigeria anymore. There is hardly anything to write about on our roads. Forgive me. There surely are. I could write about our beautiful landscapes, well-constructed roads, and subsidised transport buses. I could write about these and more if not for the praying bead in between my fingers and the Qur’an on my lap as I travel. I need them for protection against any bandits that may be fortunate enough to escape our armed forces and try to waylay us. We are a religious country; no bandits or terrorist fashioned against our highways should prosper. We must pray.
“But you surely can write about the economy.”
The Nigerian economy? I wish I could, but I do not have the right words. To write about Nigeria’s economy, you need to possess words that would leave your readers more confused than enlightened. You need to speak in billions and trillions; you know we are that rich. Besides, why would one need to write about Nigeria’s economy when its effect is very conspicuous? You only need to run yourself by billions budgeted for renovation and refurbishment of structures that house our workaholic executives, legislators, and the judiciary. I trust you will be impressed. And if you still are not impressed, take a tour of their parking lots. These are places where the economy is visibly and truly portrayed. You need no unintelligibly written analysis.
“Maybe you should write about the effect of subsidy removal.”
You really have not been paying attention. I have told you anything that is implemented to make us suffer is dead on arrival. We have grown thick skins. Our backs do not bend to suffering, no matter the straw. And if you must know, our civil servants have been smiling to the banks to cash out an additional ₦35k to their salaries. We are doing well.
“But the authorities recently reported that the unemployment rate has hit72 per cent. How do the unemployed ones get their own palliative?”
You don’t quit! The unemployed need no palliatives. They do not spend money transporting themselves to the office every workday. They are not the breadwinners of their families. Nobody expects a dime from them.
“So what will you write about then?”
There’s really nothing to write about.

My day is filled with tireless campaigning
Adequately escorted by my bullet-proof SUVs
To promise heavens to the masses
With the intention of filling my pockets first with heavenly gold
Don’t judge me

What better home than my pockets?
My nights are usually for strategising
Accompanied by some bottles of Moet and Dom Pérignon
With chunks of ego in place of ice cubes

With a little touch of Messianic vibes
You know it won’t sound nice without fake promises
Of poverty alleviation, development and the idiomatic greener pastures
And better days, which are always ahead
I may not have a PhD in any governance-related course
But I sure am a Professor of diverting public funds
While maintaining my reputation as a beacon of hope
It is not an easy task
It requires the perfect balance of charm and cunning
I have taken my oath of office
I don’t really care whether you have wheat and oats
The funny thing is that my two terms are assured
The cycle continues
I earnestly hope that the people continue sleeping

Media’s marvelous makeover: From honest messengers to political puppetry,https://punocracy.com/medias-marvelous-makeover-from-honest-messengers-to-political-puppetry/,2023-12-16T08:36:58+01:00,"By:Mustapha Lawal
Once upon a time, in a land where the media held the lofty responsibility of being an independent body, the guardian of truth, and the voice of the people, a grand transformation took place. Citizens, in the good old days of handwritten messages and small societies, could engage directly in their democratic processes. Alas, as populations grew, communication had to go through the inevitable makeover – first newspapers, then radio, television, and finally, the Internet, where misinformation found its virtual playground.
The media, once a valiant watchdog exposing excesses and corruption, found itself in a theatrical role as a tool for political propaganda. A twist of events led to the media being more concerned with sensational headlines and unverified reports than the dreary business of reporting.
A wise Naija warrior had pointed out the absurdity in the recent media circus that passed as election coverage. In a post from the realm of X (Twitter), the sage was caught exclaiming, “In elections filled with drama – violence, ballot box snatching, and corruption – Naija Media reports generously sprinkled with fantasy tales like ‘Hope of the masses clears polls, Grand(god)father Dello wins all LGAs, Egbon Dapo delivers polling units against opponents’… It’s simply obscene!”
This peculiar line of thought isn’t isolated; it seems the Nigerian media has developed a talent for weaving baseless narratives, even during times of national crises. There’s a new drama unfolding, and it’s happening on Naija National Television! Shakespeare would be stunned.
What could possibly be the driving force behind this riveting media makeover, you ask? Enter the wizards of technology, particularly social media. The enchanting world of online platforms, with their dynamic nature and a distinct lack of fact-checking spells, has become a breeding ground for the spread of misinformation.
According to great scholars, the internet’s ever-connected nature and the need for speed over accuracy have birthed the false news phenomenon. In this virtual race for attention, online content providers are in a zero-sum competition – winner takes all, sanity be damned!
The once noble guardians of truths, faced with the frantic pace of the online realm, are now caught in a dilemma – to go fast or go home. Unlike the leisurely print media of yore, online publications are forced to publish hastily, racing against time and sanity. To poetically put it, “Because they are fighting for attention, many are driven to post first and verify later, which is harming our sanity.” A moment of silence for the dearly departed sanity.
But fear not, for there’s more to this tale! The landscape of journalism and media ownership has taken a dramatic turn, steering the media away from its once-independent stance. Independence is so last season; being a puppet has never been so chic.
Now, dear reader, brace yourself for the consequences of this media metamorphosis – the erosion of public trust. Journalists, once revered truth-seekers, now face the Herculean task of maintaining independence and credibility while juggling political pressure and interference.
But fret not, for in the face of these challenges, there is hope – the kind that springs from fostering media literacy among the masses. Imagine a world where individuals can critically evaluate news sources, separating fact from fiction. Ah, what a utopia that would be! Responsible journalism, committed to truth and ethics, becomes the sword that can slay the dragons of fake news and political manipulation.
Dear reader, as the media embarks on this marvellous makeover from independent thinkers to political puppetry, let us don our satirical glasses and view the absurdity with a discerning eye. Nigeria, in all its dramatised glory, becomes a stage for this cosmic comedy. Only through a vigilant and critical approach to media consumption can we hope to navigate this theatrical landscape, where truth and accountability wear the masks of political puppetry.

A message from the camp director,https://punocracy.com/a-message-from-the-camp-director/,2023-12-16T08:07:03+01:00,"By:Abdulazeez Mustapha Opeyemi
Good day, Prospective Corp Members, and welcome to Batch A, Stream I orientation camp. We are glad to see that so many of you could make it. About ten or twenty of you were kidnapped on their way here, but their parents are already busy gathering the ransom, so there is nothing to be scared of. That’s why we keep telling them to fly rather than drive, but some people prefer the road scenery to their lives. Shameful. Hopefully, their parents can get them out soon enough for them to join us before the camp closes. May Almighty God not let their cases be like those four corp members who are still in captivity after four months. Amen. Anyway, we are glad those of you here could make it.
Now that you are here, I should inform you that whatever you thought you knew about NYSC was probably a mirage. Were you told this is about unity? Don’t make me laugh. We gave up on that project a long time ago. You thought it was about serving a country? Even the ones whose full-time jobs are about service don’t serve anymore. You thought it would be a fun adventure? Haha haha. Pardon my laughter, but oh dear Prospective Corp Members, don’t be so naïve.
You, my dears, are here to be prepared for the future as proper Nigerians. Everything you learn here will be teaching you about the real Nigeria you are about to enter.
We prepare you for Nigerian democracy by choosing Platoon Leaders for you even though we assure you it was your election. The young man we had been secretly pushing towards you because we knew him to be more gentle and easier to accept our suggestions is who you finally voted for? Oh no, we are shocked. (Nahh, we’re not.)
Like the world you are about to enter, nothing works here. We will give you lots, about 1,950 of you, I think, three water taps and Storex tanks to share. There’ll be a lot of queues but manage them. This is a camp, not your father’s house. Sometimes we will fuck with you by not pumping the water on time. What’s a Nigerian life without screams and struggles? Everyone knows that corp members who fight together stick together.
On the subject of queues, there will bealotof them.A lot. Here, you will queue to eat, queue to bath, queue to shit, queue to pee, queue to be paid, and queue to be heard. In a way, you should be glad that there are queues instead of those rowdy things thugs and miscreants do in motor parks, but you are graduates — we expect that much orderliness from you. Oh, you’re waiting for the catch? The catch is that we don’t give you enough time to do anything. After queuing for water, you have to queue to do your laundry. After doing your laundry, you have to queue to dry those clothes. After spreading those clothes, you have to queue to get food. These queues take time, you see. We know that, and you know that. So, like the fun people we are, we only give 1,950 people an hour for all these things. The trick is for you to choose a priority; you either eat, do your laundry, or get that strange thing we put in the timetable as a siesta.
What will an ideal Nigerian society be without soldiers? Our history is not complete without them. As future leaders, you should get to know them too. Many of you have fancy ideas in your heads, probably because of the bloody fancy schools you just got out of. There will be no protests here, I assure you. There will be no civil disobedience, no matter what we do. There will be no shouts and no disagreements. Just look at those uniforms and feel the fear of frog jumps envelop you. You can already tell that they are shaking so much because they cannot “punish” you as much as they would like since you are Federal Government children. However, do not give us a reason to unleash them.
As proper Nigerians, we cannot keep you here for three weeks without wasting your time. Make no mistakes; we are not talking about our time but yours. We will not let you sleep a minute past 4:30, but we will keep you in the social night past your bedtime. We do not care that some of you do not enjoy that night because we are always there to chaperone you. It is funny when you think you have a say. Hahahaha; oh my God … We will not let you spend a second past your lunchtime, but we will keep you for some time after your parade. What will you do, huh? Cry to Mama?
Also, many of you will faint during these three weeks. We tell people it is because you are not used to the stress, but we both know that is bullshit. It is usually because of the filthy food that people prefer not eating and the hours you will either spend in the sun or sitting in a plastic chair. The script, be informed, is to tell everyone it is the stress. We already have a bet in the staff quarters about how many of you in this stream will faint. I’m betting on 106. Please make that the magical number. Be informed that our clinic is only present in name. Like all things, it exists, so we can tell people it exists. Treating you for any emergency is not part of the deal.
Finally, social media is a double-edged sword, my dear PCMs. The phones you hold in your hands are dangerous spirits. You people are fond of turning your Instagram Live on immediately if any slight issue happens. We will not allow that here. This is Nigeria; freedom of speech is allowed, but freedom after speech is non-existent. Your various universities should have taught you that much, especially you people from Unilorin. I hear they run that school like a military dictatorship. That school really creates the ideal Nigerian citizen, the type that keeps quiet even when fire is set to their balls.
There is more information that I want to share with you, but let us stop here for now. Welcome again, and thank you for not acting like these politicians who do not attend the corps they keep promoting. Thank you."
Letters to Nigeria and planning a party through rough times,https://punocracy.com/letters-to-nigeria-and-planning-a-party-through-rough-times/,2023-12-09T09:11:26+01:00,"By:Osedebamen Mary Julius
October 2020.
Dear Nigeria,
The saying goes, “A fool at forty is a fool forever.” Happy sixtieth birthday! Harsh, isn’t it? The dawning reality that you are nowhere close to the better tomorrow you have been clamouring for.
So, what now? Do we talk about solutions to your ever-prevalent problem, or should we just catch cruise on social media? Let’s check the latest trend on Twitter and retweet.
It’s too bad you are turning sixty during this pandemic. That your friend would have thrown you the wildest party,the guy just dey cash out from HK. Just imagine it! Imagine the babes that would have come — in more ways than one. Amaka and her baddies would definitely have attended. Did you hear?! One of them is going to be the fifth wife of one rich senator so better knack your last one well o. She has now gone from that small girl of yesterday who was asking us for urgent 2k to big man’s wife. How time flies!
We would have invited a few guys over, but not Chidi, because we have to invite Mohammed. Then maybe we might invite that pastor to pray for you and bless your new age. I hear he wants to add a new car to his collection, so why not donate some cash so he can celebrate you in church on Sunday, a front-row seat kinda of celebration? We would get drinks (beta one o) and food. Plus, I have a shisha guy.
Guy, the party for go well! I heard you’ve gotten your cut of the national cake, so everywhere must stew! Invite Bisi, send her some cash, and I’m sure she will stop playing hard to get. With this ASUU strike going on, she has just been sitting at home, and I hear her dad lost his job. I’m sure she will be in dire need of money now.
So, we would have babes and ballers. Oh! We would have also invited that your friend who just became a governor. He called yesterday to tell me he was acquitted of the charges of electoral malpractice, so he would definitely have been in the mood to celebrate. But you have to remove that one-legged beggar who is always sitting in front of your gate. If we ever have a party, we wouldn’t want the guests to see such an eyesore.
One last thing before I go: remember that after all the congratulations and gallantry, your problems will still be waiting for you. Your debts are rising, people are getting poorer, insecurity and much more. But it’s your day, enjoy it! Bask in the praises they are going to make up about you. Maybe, just maybe, this sixtieth year will provide you with an epiphany on how far you have fallen.
Your friend,
Satire.
October 2021.
Dear Nigeria,
Dis year no go work for party o. Our pieces from last year are still scattered around like shameless rags.We gats pick them up.
Your friend,
Satire.
October 2022.
Dear Nigeria,
Dis year sef no go work. How do we throw a party when students have been out of university for eight months? I’d advise we use the money to settle ASUU. We also need a month of silence for our dearly departed, those invited by death and those invited by the diaspora.
Your friend,
Satire.
January 2023.
Dear Nigeria,
Time sure flies. Your sixty-third birthday is coming. Did that epiphany ever hit you?
Guy, I dey hear some kind things for street.People no dey send you again. I hear citizens have little to no faith in you and the other nations look down on you now. Mighty giant of Africa! It can’t be true, can it? Did you not see the call for change resounding years before its time? How did you not notice your sagging shoulders slowly dropping your pride like a loose-fitting agbada?
When I caught wind of these talks, I just knew you needed a birthday bash like no other to pick you up. Because that has always done the trick; it just takes a good flex, meme, or cruise to pick us right up.
But when I heard of that deadly massacre at Lekki toll gate that happened just nineteen days after your birthday. I thought to myself, “What meme can bring us back from this?” But, men, are we resilient!Naija no dey carry last!
We should have just had that party two years ago, deadly virus ravaging the globe be damned. Then, there was the whole ‘hoarded palliative’ debacle. That virus really did a number on you, didn’t it? But depressing matters aside, we must plan a party this year!
First things first, we need ballers! Mad money ballers! Who cares what age they are? I hear the current guy painting the town red is just 17. But you wouldn’t believe the things he has gone through at such a young age. The things he suffered and the things hesacrificedto get where he is now.At such a young age!
Bisi don get sugar daddy o, one old papa with more money than he knows what to do with. Even Amaka is married now. She got married during that eight-month-long strike, a new record for ASUU if you ask me, and she is already an expecting mother. She sent me an invite, but I was too busy trying to work my way to Yankee. Believe it or not, even I caught the japa syndrome. Almost all of our friends have fled for ‘greener pastures’ in another man’s land. It’s funny, really.
Truthfully, the real reason I wanted to leave was  I had taken enough. Just one year ago, my friend lost her dad to kidnappers whose origin we shall not mention. They paid the ransom, but the man was never found. As if that was not enough, I lost another friend just last year to the Ondo shooting. Great guy, god-fearing and kind. He just wanted to serve his God.
I digress. So we could try inviting Bisi and Amaka. Maybe they would honour it for the old times’ sake. Then there is your politician friend, still very much available to party. Besides, he is going to need all the support he can get; elections are around the corner, and I don’t think his sugar-coated tongue is as powerful as it used to be.
We have also got to think of funding for the party. With this cashless policy that is choking everyone, alongside the rapidly increasing cost of living and the scarcity of fuel that has added to the price inflation, times are hard.Shey we no go just do small chops? Bag of rice dey go 50k o. And this is just the start of the year, how will things be when we get to your birth month?
Your guy has got himself a girlfriend though. A real baddie. She is currently being investigated for examination malpractice at her university and needs to blow off steam. His defence is that she spent eight months taking the government’s advice of learning a skill but was only given an impromptu one month to gather an entire semester’s worth of knowledge and write exams the next month. What’s the point of the certificate sef? I hear there are no jobs with open arms out there anymore.Microbiology graduate dey sell wig, Economics graduate don turn perfume plug.
I don’t know if you feel it too, but we need a win badly.
Your friend,
Satire.

"Lyricism for Nigerian male pop stars, sexism for women?",https://punocracy.com/lyricism-for-nigerian-male-pop-stars-sexism-for-women/,2023-12-05T12:00:06+01:00,"By:Esther Omoye
While Nigerian pop music may have an approachable, upbeat sound, those accessible rhythms dominating the airwaves actually contain just as much violence and misogyny in their lyrics as hip-hop and rap music.Many popular Nigerian songs have lyrics that degrade or demean women by portraying them as submissive or sexually objectified. Sometimes, when we are too busy dancing to a catchy beat, we tend to lose sight of what is actually being said. And, more times, this is socially acceptable in Nigeria than those lyrics, which might actually be holding some pretty misogynistic messages — from artists where it may be expected or maybe not so much.
It shouldn’t still be possible to listen to music with misogynistic messages without being worried about the kind of messages they could possibly be putting out there, especially as stories have feet that travel farther than a Nigerian politician’s thirst for a second tenure.
Misogyny has always been an issue in the media. The over-sexualisation of women is appalling and degrading. This problem also often slips because we have become desensitised to it by simply applying the popular Nigerian factor: “it is just a song.”
If you listen to Nigerian pop songs, you can easily pick apart that women are nonchalantly objectified, demeaned and exploited in several ways, like bone away from agidi jollof. Misogyny in music is a huge problem that can perpetuate rape culture, stereotypes, objectification, and exploitation towards women everywhere.
But what actually makes a song misogynistic? Well, it is not the Nigerian green white green flag or the fact that Burna Boy has a hit anthem for ourcity boy,but it could be a number of things. It could just be how a few of the lyrics are worded, the overall topic that the song is focused on, or even the song’s title. And here are just a few Nigerian pop songs that hold not-so-hidden misogynistic messages —whether these artists actually knew that’s what their lyrics were hinting at or not:
“Opotoyi” by Naira Marley
Naira Marley can be considered the contemporary pioneer of the genre, Songs-That-Hate-Women-and-the-People-that-Love-Them. In 2019, Naira Marley dominated the airwaves with his hit song “Opotoyi”. One of Marley’s finest throwaway pop songs is packed with his precision and power for such representation of women.  But before then, his previous songs were littered with thirst traps for men with an unvanquishable desire for his lewd lyrics.
In Opotoyi, Naira Marley applied so much bravado, I am sure that all the egbon adugbos at Oshodi underbridge questioned their sense of power in bridling harassment towards female passer-by. He had everyone on a hook and spurted theMarlianmovementlike a long-awaited messiah across Nigeria.
However, as fun as the song was to dance to for his fans, Opotoyi had lyrics such as: “She’s looking at me like she wants to fuck me o”, “ She wants to suck, baby girl can you suck big”, “ Big boobs, just like tiger pussy, sexy girl, let me put my head on your boobs”, “ What do you wanna drink, she requested for Coke, Coker! I called my dealer, he sniff am with my weed Ganja!”, “Quick and fast just like sugar, I wanna release, pussy sweet just like sugar”, and “So it’s big like this, You used clothes to cover it.”
While Naira Marley never responds to the claims about his songs, his endorsement of such lyrics to a degree reflects the broader societal opportunities for affirming hegemonic masculinity —allusions to sexual acts or male domination, where the blatant abuse of women is uncommon or fairly subtle.
The acceptance of his songs draws more attention to the subtext of censorship rather than the misogyny and exploitative ravaging of women in them. There are no questions for him, just an understanding that undermines and condones the interpretation of his lyrics.
“Cast” by Shalipopi, ODUMODUBLVCK
When Shalipopi released his debut hit single Elon Musk, half of the country was ready to jump into a spaceship to Pluto with thePluto Presido.The other half was caught in between his cartoonish lyrics in his later releases and the later appreciation for his audacity in creating a new platform for Southern Nigerian artists.
But what some of his listeners didn’t expect was how quickly he picked a nasty dialect rich with the imagery of sex and the degradation of women. Although some listeners claimed it was expected and attributed it to the Ghetto-Benin-Hustler syndrome, saying the artiste had to pimp for himself a localised form of cultural expression that promoted his roots. I am quick to question if the degradation of women in music is somewhat attributable to ethnographic aesthetics. If Patoranking was singing about consent in 2016, “if she no give me, I no go take o”, why is it any different for the young crooner and his Siamese twin ODUMODUBLVCK in their recent feature, Cast?
A heated public debate is not required to confirm that ODUMODUBLVCK has a great ascendancy of misogynistic content in his songs, and the rapper takes no keenness in accepting such criticism against his songs. As he continues to be marketed as the new face of alte music in Nigeria, our IT’S-NOT-HARD-TO-BE-A-MISOGYNST-OUT-HERE pioneer further prides himself in the normalisation of his lyrics disregarding the complaints of violation of gender etiquettes in them.
As much as a handful of the reactions from men on Nigerian Twitter towards his lyrics are more impressionistic than systematic, it perfectly puts the bigger picture together — that currently, the most honoured way of being a man requires the acceptance of attitudes that objectify women, practices that subordinate them, and derogation of men who adopt a different orientation. This requires all other men to position themselves in relation to it.
In Cast, after Shalipopi does some Queen Premier warm up with his trademark word“say-say-say”he continues with lyrics such as: “Presido with the big machine. Your girlfriend friend wanna suck my thing”, “Put your girl on phone, 12 o’ clock for night”, “She located my location, Pluto, are you feeling the vibration?” Then our sensational wannabe-abobitransitions with lyrics such as: “Willy-Willy practitioner”, “Big kala need your bunda bam bam”, “If she no fuck o if she no suck”, “Who go pay for her wig and handbag?”
Although the mainstreaming of pimp chic has become a fascinating cultural trend, it is pervasive to attribute women to prostitution. Nigerian male pop stars take pride in singing about women being drilled, wrecked and otherwise roughened up that Cast doesn’t disappoint with its now very popular catchphrase: “if she no fuck o if she no suck” “who go pay for her wig and handbag?” A bend-down-select variety where it remains uncommon for the female persona to be considered intelligent, independent, or equal to men.
In recent times, it is even more like cosplaying the street heroic and accessorising misogyny as conventional. The sexual objectification of women is adjacent to the hypersexuality and gratification of men, and this plays to the larger archetype of women being regarded as gratuitous.
“Heartbreaker” by Blaqbonez
Blaqbonez can be allowed all the accolades he receives for his PR stunts and his creativity in music videos, but one thing that will always linger behind is how the rapper further objectifies women in a culture that already objectifies them over time. Emeka mustshine, indeed.
Much of the rapper’s personality might be perched between his days in OAU, humor, and shock value on Twitter, but his music output shouldn’t be treated with such forgetability and engagement.
In his single, Heartbreaker, featuring Nigerian favourite-darling, SA rapper Nasty C, Blaqbonez effectively creates an example of how insidious rap songs can be with C caressing his verse with that false prima-donna praise around words like “pussy and hoe”.
Heartbreaker opens with Blaqbonez rapping melodically to lyrics like: “This hoe tell me she like me”, “Hope this dick is enough for ya”, “Saw my old crush and I f-ck her”, “Like I missed her but the pussy average”, “Only fucked you because you stunted on me”, “Five bad bitches, fuck a lockdown.”
Then our distant cousin from Johannesburg takes over with lyrics such as: “I’m a savage”, “She knew it when I banged her”, “I got manners though, I still banked her”, “Gave her five stars, I ranked her”, “ I got wood, she a wood chipper”, “Eat me up like good dinner, I beat it up like Suge”, “Pussy caught a L, on hell”, “Dick hard like a stale”, “Would you still wanna come ride me?”
Most of Blaq’s songs sing like a queasy-not-too-filthy ode to femininity, like the way Lagos mobile toilet rentals litter the city, promising a better treat than public loos only to still forcefully pinch your nose into disappointment from its not-so-different stench. Throughout Heartbreaker, Blaqbonez and Nasty C fixate on the power they hold over women sexually—and the power they can hold over them financially.
Hip-hop music has struggled to comfortably fit with other genres in Nigerian mainstream music for years. But the versatility of most Nigerian rappers continues to piggyback sexism from Shitta to Ojuelegba. And this bias is further fostered and recapitulated into the kind of rap music that gets the greatest airplay on radio stations across Nigeria.
When so casually overlooked, sexist lyrics reflect the rooted misogyny in our society. It also hinders the societal perception of women and their progress in modern society.
“Madu” by Kizz Daniel
I like to think of Kizz Daniel as the star boy of profitable misogyny. One of the biggest moments of misogynistic lyricism that placed the pop star in the spotlight was the adlib in his hit single Yeba, where a girl can be heard saying “Uncle stop touching,” with the reply “sorry madam.”
In 2017, the multiple hitmaker faced a lot of criticism for disregarding consent from women, and he responded in a PR haul, describing it as rather his support for women’s consent and silencing victims of abuse.
This wasn’t the first time too that our Cassava Boy has travelled through this territory. There is this veiled but pervasive theme of male ownership and satisfaction over women’s bodies that colours his output. Take his 2019 hit, Madu: “Look at me baby, call me Zaddy”, “Come to my bedroom, cassava dey for you”, “Are you okay, are you okay?”, “ I want to use my, to shift your womb permit me”.
Perhaps you could write this off as posturing machismo, or Kizz Daniel simply continuing a tradition of misogynistic lyrics in music. Maybe even more politely: “separate the art from the artist”.
This casual misogyny shouldn’t exist in a blaise of artistic expression, especially with the rise of the “manosphere” online and their constant subjugation of women.
What does this have to do with Kizz Daniel? Obviously, the singer’s lyrics aren’t analogous to outright violence. However, they do contribute to and align with a worrying normalisation of misogyny within mainstream culture. The ant that eats up a vegetable lives in the vegetable itself. His continued production of such songs is another tributary that feeds into a thirst that not only celebrates the objectification towards women but rewards it, too. Male narcissists have been shown to have hostility towards women due to them being “sexual gatekeepers,” it is also unsurprising that they display a sense of sexual entitlement.
Kizz Daniel might not be offering you the red pill, but he can probably tell you how to get one. I don’t know if he has similarly been radicalised, but he has honed in on this same type of song for years. He’s mostly refrained from the type of a-word, b-word, and h-word slanging that has permeated mainstream Nigerian music, but his soft-boy-gimmick aids and abets the misogyny it puts together.
“Igbeyawo” by Oritsefemi
When Igbeyawo was released, the whole of Lagos danced in their expensive dry lace and aso oke every Saturday. And half the others probably thought we had a proper, well-seasoned Yoruba rendition of Bruno Mars’s “Marry You.” You know, the type with the bata, sekere, agogo, omelette and the percussion of Oritsefemi vocals to carry it into wedding parties bump to bump.
But Igbeyawo opens with what I would better describe as paint-in-water misogynistic lyrics: “What God has joined together, Let no man put asunder, Shey ori iwo iyawo, Gbo ti oko eh (Eh o), Ounje lasiko, Pon’omi lasiko, (Oya) Fo’aso lasiko, Fun ni tibi yen lasiko, Tori oun ti a gbesile oun ni omo eran gbey, Oruko taba so’omo ni’omo aje, Eyi tio bimo ah bimo, Gbogbowa lashi ma gbе omo jo, Eh se jeje, Sе jeje.”
which translates to: “You, wife, listen to your husband. Cook on time. Fetch water on time. Wash in time. Give him sex on time. What we leave is what the goat takes (what we don’t value, someone who values it takes it.) The name we give a son is what he bears. Those who do not have a child will give birth. We will all carry our child. Take care.”
Given that the music we get is mainly dominated by male artists and caters to dance floors, it is no surprise that many songs by Nigerian artists scavenge for loot around lust and the domestication of women, which is also aided by our society’s deeply valued patriarchal system.
It has become the norm for women to serve as objects for affection, function, and desire, more or less reinforcing the unideal ways men have been conditioned to view and communicate with women. You most likely would have danced to Igbeyawo, praising Oritsefemi for such an over-the-topgbedu.
But while Bruno Mars was busy making us question the depth of romance in our lives, Oritsefemi was giving us bite-size chunks, which seem valuable but, to an extent, require a necessary negation to self-impose.
Marriage is ultimately whatever the people in it decide it is, but the hitmaker has such plainness to his lyrics that a listener might easily miss him subjugating woman into a typical subservient position, just the way Nigerian politicians easily preach the gospel of choice of candidacy freedom, but enslave the electorate with its existing statesmanship.
The “Flog Politician” hitmaker sings with such precision, cutting through sex role specialisation, the way anObiomawill expertly cut through the extra garment in the outfit for your nextparteafterparte: Women overcoming role inflexibility in marriages can be very hard. As marriage and gender are both societal constructs specific to locations and cultures, variations are expected, especially across social groups.
The last thing we need is yet another song that tidies up such stiff mentality in today’s society.
“Story For The Gods” by Olamide
A pioneer of indigenous and reality rap, Olamide’s musings about street life, its brutality and its survival system date back to his award-winning debut album, “Rapsodi”.
Baddo Sneh is known for the glorious storytelling in his songs, and sometimes, it is not hard to read into his lyrics. However, it is this same incredible lyricism that makes it nearly impossible to go through his 2014 hit “Story For The Gods”.
In a genre that hasn’t skipped on the degradation of women, the rapper stands out for his alarmingly disturbing lyrics sometimes, and it is questionable to an extent because he could put out a new album about just anything, and people will still vibe to it.
Nonetheless, the evidence of our culture’s unwillingness to address the reality and ubiquity of men’s violence against women is not merely contained in Olamide’s Story of the Gods lyrics: “O ti mu dogoyaro, Like monkey tail Caro, Ba mi wey Claro, I want to do sina today, She say she cannot wait o, She say its getting late o, She say she wants to faint oo, Haaaa Story for the gods, Now she say Mo ro go, O ti kan mi lapa oo, O ti kan mi leyin o, Story for the gods, The gods oh.” It is also contained in the unsophisticated understanding of the social functions of art. And it takes no great leap of logic to see that sexism works that way.
The imagery in these lyrics is so cringe, advocating for the use of substances to cross boundaries. The whole song is about blaming these actions on booze, and it brings up so many issues in victim-blaming. It’s one thing for rappers to brag about getting sex, but it’s another thing to think the sex is owed. And it’s another thing to demand it and not take no for an answer because of it.
Unquestionably, Olamide typically centred on the initial rise of his notoriety and now to the heights of Nigerian pop cultural fame. Olamide’s fans can argue that his lyrics aren’t meant to be taken seriously. “Just because we listen to his music doesn’t mean we are going to go out and harass, rape and murder women. We know it’s just a song. These Twitter women are doing too much these days.” But then, the fact remains that the local rapper was singing melodiously to lyrics that suggested rape.
Rather, one of the most damaging aspects of the rapper’s virulent misogynistic lyrics is how normal and matter-of-fact this violence comes to seem as if one is just casually saving oneself from falling off the crooked seats in a molue.
Rapping about rape has the effect of desensitising people to the real pain suffered by victims. Also, the process of desensitisation to violence through repeated exposure has been studied for decades. Excessive amounts of fictionalised portrayals of men’s violence against women in mainstream media could likely lead to real-life violence.
“Philo” by Bella Shmurda, Omah Lay
Bella Shmurda had warmed the hearts of so many Nigerian listeners with his 2019 hit, “Vision 2020,” telling the typical Nigerian cash-cow story of “grass to grace.”
The Ikorodu singer went on to release other hits like “Cash App” and “Rush” the following year, and in 2022, he released his hit single, Philo, off the album “Hypertension”, featuring Afro-Depression crooner Omah Lay.
Omah Lay might have an album that feels like couch therapy, soothing your angst and heartache all year long, but one thing the singer effortlessly flaunts aside his mastery in crafting timeless ballads is his appreciation for lyrics that sometimes brandish women.
The “Bad Influence” hitmaker can literally start a cult named The Heartbreak Society, and half of the country wouldn’t mind being a part of it. His lyrics have this potent force of shaping even the simplest of experiences into the extraordinary. It’s like the emotional regulation you never realised you needed until you hear one of his songs.
Omah Lay’s songs are time capsules of failed relationships that were never our fault, and sometimes declaration of our love, that evenwatapiapiacannot kill.
Listeners don’t go to the 26-year-old singer for emotional maturity and promises of true love; they know he has curated an image that simplifies the intricacies and shortcomings of human emotions. But this world of consistent heartbreak is cut short by the momentary bliss of his 2022 hit, with our most stylish Ikorodu-boi, Bella Shmurda.
Philo starts with lyrics: “Nothing wey I no go do for my Philo, Rest on me like pillow” sculpting emotive longing but the next verse of lyrics “Nothing wey I no go do for my Philo, My personal olosho” is honed into a sharper, petty edge.
Then, there are verses with lyrics that follow with machine-like precision and intent: Emi lo kan, Dangbana Vuvuzela, blow me zella Me, I no like wahala, I dey run from yawa, I just like your matter Sister Esther, off your pata”
“Nothin’ I no go do for my baby oku, We cause and then discuss and fuck oh, She no dey record oh”,  “Oh, when I hit her my hammer, my sledger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, she dey take amPenpene, penpeneda, I can not play with her Arsène Wenger,” “Ah, put it in, Put it in, ah, make I put it in, Put it in, shey if I put it in, Put it in, shey you go leave it in?”
The hypersexualisation in Philo is shielded by the muscle fibre of Bella and Omah Lay’s romanticisation, and we are presented with a new question and narrative arc: how should having sexual relationships with women be talked about in songs; POV: sex is something a man needs to do to a woman.
Over the years, the lyrics of Philo remained sustained by the sheer force of internet savour and became a meme: “Sister Esther, off your pata.” However, it isn’t surprising that this phrase has somehow become a cheese trap online. It is supremely one of the many examples that explain that the chaos done to the identity of women isn’t a pit; it is a ladder.
There’s comfort in the realisation that the internet and listeners understand how awful these lyrics objectify women, but at the same time, how much longer are we going to wait for these pop stars to stop giving us a good portion of sexism?
“Sun Seyin” by CDQ
Exploring the effects of song lyrics should be a relevant undertaking in our society. It will come as no surprise that people listen to music daily. More often than not, lyrics get stuck in our heads.
Therefore, songs deemed especially popular might have a stronger hold on us with their lyrics. Indigenous rapper CDQ is best known for his single “Nowo E Soke”, and his catalogue has continued to grow significantly over the years.
Right from his early days, the rapper has never failed to include sex into his songs if he needed to. Well, sex sells better than a cold drink in Lagos traffic for most of these rappers. It’s continued to be a hot topic that often finds its way into rap lyrics. Due to the machismo that’s hawked with the genre, rappers are mostly renowned for bragging about all the gratuitous sex they have and how trophy-worthy they are.
Most rap songs about sex are brazen and dispersed like the stench that guards your nose jealously through Oshodi underbridge. In Sun Seyin, there are lyrics that screech similarly: “Swear say you no know say balloon no be condom, Bad girl she say i be like tom tom, Oni owun o mind lati fi kinimi fo’yin, She say make i knock on her door when i wan come, A jomape comment cava, Ojo ko’n pelu auntie nofi how far, Gbagbe pe mo wu’rugbon o mio kin se Alfa, Ti’n ba kolue wamo pe pound o se egbe cefa.”
At the surface level, these lyrics might seem without malice for some listeners, but they become extremely problematic in context, especially since they show a significant influence on male culture, and this reaches far beyond the music industry.
“Calm Down” by Rema
Rema might be our resident banger boy, our H-I-M, our DND Afrobeats rock star, but sometimes, one thing the pop star fails to do is to place aside his urges to add unpleasant lyrical descriptions to some of his hits, no matter how subtle they can be. And when he does fail, the 23-year-old singer wears this just beneath his belly button like a swaddle of real-time Beninwahala.
His songs swarm with references to women, heartbreak, transitions and sometimes bravado. Perhaps the most recent of his pseudo-chilling portrayal of sexism is his global hit, Calm Down.
Despite its gender-essentialist lyrics revolving around the singer’s inability to control his manly urges, Calm Down had and still has the world in a chokehold, and perhaps this just legitimises the idea that everyday misogyny is rife —often it catches you unawares in the form of toe-tapping, club-thumping hit singles.
With its catchy rhythm, Calm Down arguably takes the spot for the most mainstream and mixed-up on this list. Lyrics include: “See this fine girl, for my party she wear yellow, Every other girl they dey do too much but this girl mellow, Naim, I dey find situation, I go use take tell am hello, Finally, I find way to talk to the girl but she no wan follow, Who you come dey form for?, Why you no wan’ conform?, Then I start to feel her bum-bum, But she dey gimme small, small.”
These lyrics run over the age-old problem of consent. It describes how the singer decides to start feeling up a lady after approaching her and she shows reluctance. While there have been defences on Twitter describing the act as a normal act in parties and clubs, groping is a huge problem in Nigeria. Women get grabbed in buses, traffic, markets, clubs, parties, and everywhere you can think about, and it is not a topic that should easily be brushed off as the norm.
Rema might be enamoured with this girl in yellow at his party, but it necessarily doesn’t translate into his decision to grab her without asking her first because he thinks she’s interested in him and just playing hard to get: “Who you come dey form for? Why you no wan’ conform?, Then I start to feel her bum-bum, But she dey gimme small, small.”
Consent is never implied; it is specific, enthusiastic and reversible. This doesn’t even need a textbook definition because it perpetuates the idea that women’s boundaries can be violated and their complaints and indifferences invalidated because they are found in certain environments.
You may have pushed your way through the crowd to get as close to the stage as possible and you might have even screamed “Calm Down” lyrics at the top of your lungs. I think I would have had a better time than you at this concert too, screaming louder than the trumpet playing from the church beside my house, though, if I wasn’t so observant and sceptical as if a whitlow will gradually grow to eat up my fingers for steadying my incredibly bad dance steps to this bop.
“Red Flags” by Ruger
Now, Ruger might be one of the most rising stars in Nigerian Pop, with an eye patch that could rival Jack Sparrow; his impact can be measured just by his 2.7 million monthly Spotify listeners and 2.2 million Instagram followers.
But the D’ Prince’s signee has a history of blatant misogyny and disrespect towards women, specifically during his concerts, and his songs are not shy of such attention.
Personally, I cannot hold my breath for a society that will always favour profit over the value of its people, but I always think to myself, sometimes, if the young star’s treatment of women during his concerts is yet another corporate marketing strategy, or simply a flex of his cis-ness?
“Red Flags” is nearly three minutes of incel rhetoric and objectification defined chiefly by Ruger’s open-and-shut mannerism with dealing with his partner. Ruger successfully delivers a musical equivalent of an incel anthem: Especially for men who can’t get women or the women they expect to attain, and when they get these women, they discard them as a validation of their own insecurities.
Performative, toxic masculinity has always been a major part of being a successful Nigerian pop star. Women bear the most significant consequences of these norms from allegedly destructive men like the lyrics of Red Flags suggests: “She said, RU, baby this ain’t you!”, “You’re not the sweet guy I was knew”, “Did I do anything wrong or you don’t love me anymore?”, “Why did you change so bad towards me?”
“You’re treating me like shit” and Mr Cuckuroockoo continues singing: “You saw the red flags baby, and you ignored the red flags”, “ See I can’t change, baby you better rest or you end this now”, “Time’s not on your side, Check the clock”, “I know you fell in love with my cock and glock”, “I’m a billion reasons why we can’t work o baby”.
While Ruger paints himself as a lost soul without any need for redemption in Red Flags, all he has to do is mature from his covert narcissism. He may have the vocal inflections, but his percussive trope in Red Flags still surrounds the maltreatment and disregard women face in Nigerian pop songs. Covertly manipulating women into fast-forwarding roles after creating a bond early on and later showing resentment and cold withdrawals to maintain the carousel isn’t a message that should be out there.

Dear PCM,
Good evening, and congratulations on your call to service. You were called to a compulsory one year of service because you successfully graduated from a Nigerian university or a polytechnic. We thought we had not wasted your precious youth enough through the endless strikes of that certain group (wink wink), so our think tank devised a better way to waste one more year, but I digress.
I am writing to inform you that the NYSC, the regiment you are now a proud member of, does not pay ransoms. Yes, you think we are sending you to a hot zone in a country where travelling is now an extreme sport, but our security analysts have declared your posted states safe. To ensure an accurate report, we used the same intelligence agencies that did not see the attack on the NDA coming, that have not made any headway with the incessant bandit attacks on the highways, the same ones that did not prevent the attack on the President the other day. You can, therefore, rest assured that when they say you are safe, you are indeed safe.
If you are attacked, we advise you to please cooperate with your captors. They have short fuses and itchy trigger fingers (our intelligence agencies still have not figured out where they buy these guns in bulk). When you are taken hostage, please contact any of your family members who can pay the ransom. When the ransom has been paid, you can continue the journey to the orientation camp all over again to fulfil your responsibility. If they shoot you despite these hints, our condolences to your family. You are 21 after all, you have lived a full life.
Yours faithfully,
The Camp CSO.
P.S.:Do not hold your breath for the Army or any of the numerous special forces we have either. Military intervention, like all things in Nigeria, can only be accessed through premium citizenship. Your surname does not ring a bell, so good luck.
Dear CSO,
I saw your letter the other day and would like to decline your generous offer.
First of all, my parents would prefer me to be home with them rather than take a 15-hour bus from one edge of the country to the other on behalf of an unserious organisation like yours. I decided not to go against them because they would be the ones to pay that ransom if the call came. If I leave despite their protests, what will my fate be if they also abandon me? My parents did not send me across the country; you did. Why, then, should they pick up the check that came as a result of your (in)action?
Speaking of responsibility, do you even understand what the word means? Thousands of Prospective Corp Members leave their state of origin — What the hell is that state of origin thing anyway? I thought the idea of this whole thing was unity — because it is their responsibility to serve. Do you think they want to wake up at 4.30 a.m. to hear a soldier bark orders at them? Do you think they want to sleep in the same room with 20 other dumb idiots? They do all that because it is their responsibility. You think the law forces them to? Oh please. Neither our past President nor the incumbent even has a credible school certificate between them.
In summary, if a country that spends more than 500 billion naira on its Defence Budget can not even guarantee the safety of fewer than 200,000 people she called to service, maybe it is time to pack up and send theseotondoshome. Thank you. Corper Wee!
Yours humbly,
PCM."
The Nigeria we sigh for,https://punocracy.com/the-nigeria-we-sigh-for/,2023-12-05T09:33:29+01:00,"By:Frankline Chisom Ebere
Ah, Nigeria, a kaleidoscope of cultures, a mosaic of many, a land of… well, let’s just say it’s a bit of a mixed bag. It’s like a tapestry woven by a well-meaning but slightly distracted artist. You know, the kind who starts off with a grand design in mind but gets sidetracked by the odd loose thread here and there.
Now, don’t get me wrong, it’s not all doom and gloom. But let’s face it, we’ve got a bit of a cloud problem. And by cloud, I mean poverty. It’s like a perpetual eclipse, casting long shadows over our dreams and aspirations. But hey, who needs material wealth when you can have a wealth of… lack of opportunity?
So, how do we brighten up this rather sombre picture? Well, we could start by giving our paintbrush a good shake and splashing some vibrant colours around. Imagine a Nigeria where every child has a shot at a decent education, where entrepreneurs are not just tolerated but celebrated, and where work is not just a means to an end but a source of pride.
But let’s not stop there. Let’s paint a Nigeria where success is not just for the privileged few but for everyone who’s willing to roll up their sleeves and put in the hard yards. A Nigeria where diversity is not just accepted but embraced, where creativity is not just encouraged but nurtured.
Of course, to make this masterpiece a reality, we need to invest in our future artists – our children. Education is the palette from which they’ll draw their colours, the canvas on which they’ll paint their dreams. And it’s up to us to ensure that this palette is rich and diverse, that this canvas is broad and welcoming.
Now, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the elephant in the room – corruption. It’s like a termite, gnawing away at the foundations of our society. But imagine a Nigeria where corruption is as welcome as a poop at the dining table, where our leaders are as transparent as a pane of glass.
To bring this vision to life, we need to ensure that our leaders are not just accountable but held to account. We need a police that’s free to shine a light on the dark corners of corruption. And we need a government that’s as open as a book, where information is not just available but accessible.
So there you have it, the Nigeria we yearn for. It might not be perfect, but hey, what tapestry is?
Ah, the judiciary, the supposed beacon of justice in our society. Let’s paint a Nigeria where it’s as free from political interference and corruption as a unicorn is from reality. And while we’re at it, let’s ensure our judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers are as well-resourced and trained as a team of superheroes because, you know, doing their jobs effectively is apparently a novel concept.
Then there’s the not-so-small matter of insecurity. Terrorism, ethnic conflicts, communal violence – it’s like a smorgasbord of chaos and destruction. But fear not, for we shall paint a Nigeria where security is as common as air. A Nigeria where our security forces are as well-equipped, well-trained, and well-motivated as a squad of action movie heroes.
But how do we achieve this utopia, you ask? Well, we start by addressing the root causes of … Wait, you know it all. So, just paint!
But painting a new Nigeria isn’t just about addressing our challenges. It’s also about celebrating our quirks, our idiosyncrasies, the things that make us… well, us. So let’s paint a Nigeria where our cultural heritage is as celebrated as a national holiday, and our ideologies as appreciated as a viral meme.
And let’s not forget our natural beauty. From the rolling hills of the east to the beaches of the south, from the savannahs of the north to the rainforests of the west – it’s like a postcard from Mother Nature herself.
And then there’s our people. Resilient, creative, entrepreneurial – we’re like a pot of delicious edikaikong soup, filled with different ingredients coming together. So let’s paint a Nigeria where these qualities are as celebrated as a 2022 World Cup victory by Messi supremacists, and where our people are given the opportunity to succeed and lead fulfilling lives.
But to paint this new Nigeria, we must first dream. Dream of a Nigeria in all its glory. But dreaming isn’t enough. We must also take action. Because turning dreams into reality is apparently what it takes to paint the Nigeria we sigh for.

Tinubu appoints special adviser on the appointment of special advisers,https://punocracy.com/tinubu-appoints-special-adviser-on-the-appointment-of-special-advisers/,2023-11-18T09:16:24+01:00,"Nigeria’s city boy president, Baller Ahmed Tinubu, has appointed a special adviser to counsel him on the previous and future appointments of special assistants and advisers, a move analysts say is long overdue.
The president’s media aide, Ariyo Ngelale, announced the appointment through a press statement released yesterday, November 17.
“Mr Femi Oduduwa will advise the president on the very important issue of where to get the right candidates for special aide roles and how many the country needs at any point,” the statement read.
The media aide said the appointment shows that the president has listening ears after having heard many complaints about his recent appointments.
“Such an office is important to ensure that subsequent appointments are made with the people’s needs and demands in mind. We should be considerate. Instead of appointing thousands of aides, for example, the president could have hundreds. We all know the problems bedevilling this country are too many to be handled by a few people.”
Mr Oduduwa is the perfect man for the job, he explained, because he has fifteen years of experience as a serial political appointee and has dedicated his life to nothing else.
“He is also versed in seeking talents into political fan clubs and associations of keyboard warriors/media propagandists, especially during election campaign periods. He will not only be advising the president on the appointments but will also be providing counsel on all the advice that comes from the other aides,” Ngelale said.
Charles Kogbodokojami, a political commentator and rights advocate, described the move as long overdue.
“One of the most critical positions in any administration is the special assistant and adviser offices because those are the people who have the president’s ears. It is important we have someone to help the president decide who to appoint into those positions,” he argued.
The T.A. Report learnt that Kogbodokojami might himself be readying to join the government once the fortune of renewed hope smiles on him."
"Palliatives? No. SUVs, Yes!",https://punocracy.com/palliatives-no-suvs-yes/,2023-10-28T10:49:15+01:00,"By:Quadri Yahya
It is unacceptable to be doling out plenty of palliatives to the masses when they deserve Sports Utility Vehicles. We cannot justify giving one thing to one group of Nigerians and something else to another. Nigerians deserve the best things in life.
It would be a great injustice if a member of a privileged group gets an SUV while the less privileged are only given palliatives.
In the same vein, if a person can own three Land Cruisers and two Prados, why can’t the people equally have SUVs? Think about it! But first, we must begin with the people’s representatives. Eventually, it will go round.
Our current state does not prove that we are not blessed to ride in SUVs.
We are not living in penury, nor are we desperate to pay off our token debts. What some people call poverty is just an economic condition where some 133 million people have food but no mouth to put it. What some puppet experts call high debt is just a penny for chicken feed. What others call insecurity on the roads — where we intend to ostentatiously joyride our SUVs while minding our business — are just minor incidents. What naysayers describe as terrorism can be settled overnight once we mount our SUVs to the front line. What some traders and households lament as inflation is just a figure that can be rounded up. What the Bureau de Change calls unfriendly foreign exchange is absolutely friendly. What some schoolboys and girls decry as high tuition are simply charges on bank transactions.
So, what problems stop us from tossing a few coins in return for swanky SUVs?
Why SUV of all cars, you ask.
The answer is on the road. The roads are tarred and very smooth, and an SUV is the best car to explore them, regardless of the outing.
Another reason is that an SUV is an automobile designed to fight poverty and insecurity; it can impress poverty and restore peace before a parliamentary session ends.
SUVs are also great cars to distribute palliatives to the GRAs nationwide.
Finally, bear in mind that people don’t care about the price; they just want their well-deserved and desired SUVs."
10 songs to hold your hand through the Nigerian breakfast experience,https://punocracy.com/10-songs-to-hold-your-hand-through-the-nigerian-breakfast-experience/,2023-10-28T10:24:06+01:00,"By:Esther Omoye
From heartbroken Afrobeats singers to soul rockers ready to burn love to the ground, these are some of the best Nigerianbreakfastsongs ever written.
Were you dumped or did you do the dumping? Do you want them back or do you never want to see them again? Are you happy, sad, or you’re just caught in between? It doesn’t matter; there’s a song for you.
Nigerian breakup songs don’t fit one simple pattern because breakups don’t fit one simple pattern. (Okay, maybe they fit three or four patterns.) Breakup anthems are complicated things that run the full gambit of emotions. Sadness and grief are certainly the classic ones. But some are righteous cries of joy that signal the end of a bad relationship. Others are thoughtful meditations on human connection. And others… well, frankly, they’re a little toxic, songs about burning the very concept of love to the ground, forcing passionate screams so loud that your landlord threatens to evict you.
The best breakup songs distil raw, universal human emotions. On this list, you’ll find wounded Afrobeats singers, singing unbowed from the ashes of bad relationships. They are indignant and full ofpara. Simi is lurking in the shadows of her ex’s place, Nkem Owoh reminiscences about Susana’s betrayal, and Ric Hassani is asking Ogun to strike his ex and her friends down.
Among these ten breakup songs, you’re certain to find something to relate to. And if it’s all too bleak, well, I’ve got a list of pick-me-up songs to help kickstart the healing phase.
1.Last Lastby Burna Boy
This is literally the Nigerian Gen-Z GOAT breakup anthem. Since it hit the radio, it’s been the go-to anthem of many post-breakup situations. It’s the breakup anthem you listen to after being served a proper, unexpected Nigerian breakfast in bed. And as you reel over the leftovers, you completely come to agree with Burna that indeed,“last, last, na everybody go chop breakfast”,because you’ve been served too.
One of the song’s highlights is the way Burna perfectly captures the raw intensity of his emotions.
‘Why you say I did nothing for you? /When, I for do anything you want me to do /Maybe another time, maybe another life /You would be my wife and we’d get it right’.
One can easily tell dat Burna was ready to even klimb Olumo rock for this love. He was ready to doalabaruevery single day. He was very ready to turn her from asisi ekoto hisiyawo,and even go through14lives like anabiku,but e don cast,and it’s even more expensive to cry over spilt milk with how expensive everything is now.
The verse‘She manipulate my love, oh, hmm, I no holy and I no denge pose, Like Baba Fryo‘ is relatable, reflecting the universal experience of vulnerability, and also showing that Burna isn’t asmooth criminalin this thriller: they’re both painted inatarodo red.
2.Susanaby Nkem Owoh
Nkem Owoh’s personality naturally lends Susana its own hilarious spark and flow. Opening on a line, “Oh, Susana, shey you no love me again, money go, woman go.”This anthem plays around the idea of a woman who had promised her lover forever whilechoppinglife with him, but assapashowfaze,propasabigirlpakher love forGhana-must-gorun follow where go favour her next. And as Nkem Owoh sings in the bridge: “and you say you will love me forever, but as money don finish nau wahala.”
Susanais an anthem for those going through a breakup, realising their partner was just there for the benefits: theamalaat Mama Kasara9,suyaat 8:00 pm, the shopping spree atYabamarket, and the extra beefed double sausage shawarma. That always comes two minutes before hugging goodbye at her junction while the street patiently observes you two.
3.Thunder Fire Youby Ric Hassani
From the opening notes, it’s clear that “Thunder Fire You”is a deeply personal and emotional track. Ric Hassani’s soulful vocals deliver lyrics that are equal parts heartbroken and angry-like-someone-who-has-just-had-his-heart-pickpocketed-in-Oshodi, as he sings about a lover who has betrayed him and left him in pain.
The song’s chorus, which features the catchy refrain, “Thunder fire you, for all the lies you told me /Thunder fire you, for when you cheated on me /Thunder fire you”,is a standout moment that perfectly captures the song’s mix of raw emotion and seriouspara. You just have to know that thethunderRic is sending is the one fromOgunand not from the welder shop where he and his cheating ex used toblock.
4.Understandby Omah Lay
This is a serious jam for all myunderstandinggirlfriends and boyfriends. Omah Lay basically writes tear-soaked breakup ballads, and his catalogue plays out like the stages of a typical Nigerian breakup:anger, the endless calls, the endless messages, the questions, and finally, the Nigerian para that struggles with admittingsay e don burst.
Understand, however, is Omah Lay at his most defeated and desperate as the singer’s attempt at reconnecting with a lost love meets the hard wall ofIsale Eko underbridge. The lyrics express feelings of betrayal, confusion, and frustration. He emphasises the sacrifices he made for the relationship, such as giving his “umbrella”like Rihanna to be in the rain, andspending his “last card” only for the babe to still fall his handbajebajelike naira.
The repetition of the phrase “I under, under, I no fit under, under, under” suggests a struggle to comprehend the situation and the emotionalpalavait has caused.Understandstands out for its relatability and heartfelt delivery.
5.Angelinaby Simi
Simi’s era-shaping 2017 single,Angelina, was in some sense a declaration of independence from a cheetah. The song treats the end of a once-cherished relationship with bittersweet maturity, strength and a striking lack oftatashe. ‘Angelina you can have him oh Angelina /Wetin you do me with Angelina /I no want see am again.’This is a song about being realistic about the end – a sentiment that captures the tongue-tied desperation between beingdeluluand acceptance.
The song begins with a sense of urgency and frustration as the singer questions the whereabouts of theirwakawakapartner. As the story unfolds, they learn that their partner has been involved with another woman, referred to asAngelinaand knows right then and there that, no matter how much she cares for him,e don burst finally.
The catchy chorus, “Cause I don’t want another Angelina, I remember you with Angelina,” reinforces the singer’s resolve to move on and not tolerate furtherpotorpotorstains on her white.
6.Toh Badby Niyola
Where lots of break-up songs cover the feelings of knowing something is completely over, Niyola dives into the grey area of a relationship: the back-and-forth of an on-again-off-again love likeEko Electricity Distribution Company.
It’s the ache of wanting to be with someone and knowing it’s not totally right in a single song. ‘The more I try, the worse situation is getting /I’m trying to say goodbye, but I can’t let go’ —you can tell sista has to urgently send this non-commitalYoruba demonoff like Naija’s problems in an ABCD bus without goodbye. But she’s already too attached like okra to the pot.
The chorus, “Toh bad o, I say bobo you bad o, you bad o, But I love you,” further expresses her frustration, implying that despite the challenges and the heartbreak, her love go still deykampe.
7.Damagesby Tems
For anyone who’s ever dragged out a doomed relationship’s last breaths, you’ll recognise its mood in TemsDamages—‘But you still wanna get back with me /You tryna to be the one to deal with /Don’t call my phone, you’re not a mad man /You missed the way.’You can tell Tems is done with givingtems and konditionsin this relationship and no longer cares if they get breached or not, as long as she is not collateral damage: His rent is due, and he keeps calling her, running past Yaba left to Ojulegba underbridge to call for help to put out the fire, but Tems doesn’t care enough anymore.
Tems reflects on the past and asserts herindependencelike a trueNaija1960 babe, making it clear that she is no longer willing to endure the pain caused by her partner’s actions,‘Cause I’m done with it now /No more damages, no-no (No more damage).’
The lyrics‘So tell me what you need from me now, I’m not what you need to be now’evoke a sense of empowerment and self-respect, as she takes control of her own happiness and refuses to further allow herself to keep drinkingpanadol extraforone kain headache. One of the standout aspects of “Damages” is its ability to connect with empowering listeners to prioritise their well-being and leave behindanybodidatknacksdemakpako.
8.Egoby Djinee
Egois a classic that ruled airwaves in the late 2000s — and, in its simplicity ofkponkponand catchiness of refrain, remains timelessfor unrequited love.
When someone you love doesn’t reciprocate your feelings for them, leave it to Djinee to perfect thatkpo-kpoingmore than a decade before Omah Lay was doing it interopi secxxion.
The lyrics: ‘IfI die now, I go happy say /Say when I dey this world, I don fall in love /Which one you dey? /Wey you dey treat me so? /I don beg, I don do everything /But you tell me say you need time /And you no fit dey with me.”
If it looks like it’s not going to happen and talks and walks like it’s not going to happen, then it just might not happen; Heartbreaklogy 111. You can tell Djinee has been to church, but not to experience the love of his life walking down the aisle but to pray that she at least even goes on a first date with him.
The chorus, ‘Na so I bad? Anyway I dey go,’ also expresses a sense of self-respect and the decision to leave the feelings behind, seeking a fresh start.
But with the chorus, you can tell Djinne just served us a chilled glass ofFresh Yoinstead, ‘Ewo! If you help me see Ego, make you tell am I don go.” While this feels like the singer is trying to leave his feelings behind and find happiness elsewhere, you can still hear the sirens go off in his voice like a proper Nigerian politician who has just lost the elections but will still run until eternity for the same position, while making it seem like it’s the country they love and not their stomach.
9.Out of Loveby Chike
Off his correct album,Boo of the Booless,comes this popular anthem. Cheese factor aside, it is hard not to envision an overwrought heartbreak scene in some Netflix Naija rom-com movie as Chike’s voice blasts through thisemotionalmotionsickness.
Over a swelling, slow and deliberate melody like the drag ofLagos holdup, Chike calmly and painfully recounts the end of his relationship in this anthem. The song x-rays thebreakfast-ratingunion as told from his perspective. He has just realised that his efforts alone can’t save a relationship that’s gone with thebar beach waters. ‘Oh Chike oh, this is hard for me to say /But I’m gonna say it anyway /I’ve fallen out of love with you’belts out at the end.
Chike’s vocal delivery is heartfelt, perfectly conveying the pain associated with such a revelation like the free fall of Naira. His soulful and expressive voice brings raw emotion to the forefront, likeAboniki balmto a sore, allowing listeners to empathise with the conflicting emotions present in the narrative.
“Out of Love” captures the anguish and confusion experienced when one person’s love diminishes likenairawhile the other remains committed like theexchange rate.The repetition of the question “Did you even notice?” highlights the pain of feeling neglected and unimportant in a relationship.
Chike masterfully captures the essence of heartbreak, addressing the realisation of falling out of love head-on, even though it is difficult to accept that you’ve been askedto go hug transformerin that polite-unpolished-swavy-breakfast-language.
10.Bibankeby Asa
I am very sure that most Nigerians would deservedly link Asa’s mastery to her inKirikiri blue, behind a jail cell, singing to MrJailer.But Asa’s catalogue has aged finely through the years likepamithat Bibanke brings nothing less thantotoridown your body.
Bibankeis a powerful and emotionally charged song that showcases Asa’s rip-your-lover’s-heart-out-and-spit-on-it storytelling and vocal abilities.
The opening lines, ‘I wake up, I see you as you leave, I feel it, I see it as you leave,’ express thedouble wahalaof waking up and watching someone leave, feeling their absence deeply.
The song also touches upon the concept of putting upiro n’ bubato maintain appearances even when the relationship is no longer givingpepper dem.
One of the most captivating aspects ofBibankeis Asa’s exceptional performance in effortlessly creating ajagolovabetween gentle moments of reflection and powerful expressions of heartache.

I’m still confused over why so many people don’t like Nigeria and prefer tojapa. Nigeria is a peaceful country with bountiful grains, just like the colours of her flag.
Nigeria is an understanding country that has realised that providing basic amenities should be a last resort. It’s a country filled with powerful and strong Africans. Besides, her citizens adapt quickly to new hardships.
If “basic” amenities are so basic, why would they be provided? The government should concern itself with more advanced things. If it’s water, almost everyone has a well in their house or close by. The government provided water to neighbourhoods back in the day. But when the plan to upgrade it to enter all houses began, people started digging wells in their homes, so she gave up. It must’ve been an extensive plan that took a decade to plan, and extremely hurtful for all that hard work to go down the drain.
When Nigeria started building quality roads and gutters, her people preferred gutter refuse dump to any other option. I actually agree with them. Rain washes it away and after the rain stops, the waste blocks something somewhere or enters the river and beautifies it with floating objects. And when those roads get damaged, out of love, they are regularly patched. No gutters. Or with the gutters still blocked!
Constructing quality roads would make construction companies and their supervisors poor. And why would anyone strive to be poorer? The solution is to construct a substandard road so it can be repaired soon. If the roads are so bad, why do people continue to ply them?
It’s not that some roads aren’t good. The fault is with the people who don’t know how to adapt to hardship.
“UP NEPA,” like Nigerians usually chorus when the light comes on after a week or more of blackout, shows the love and understanding between her citizens and electricity providers. If not for love, why would you hail them? There would’ve been light 24/7, but the love will fade over time and neither NEPA nor its customers will have reasons to visit each other as they do now. And theswitcherwho flicks the lights on and off will become bored of his job.
Education would have been free if not that naive children would innocently take it for granted. Apart from this, knowledge of the streets builds children better than whatever they might absorb in class. They can take to the streets and learn its ways. Besides, leaders of tomorrow need connection with the “street” to become successful. To achieve this, since they wouldn’t live on their own, brave Nigeria decided to wring the life out of their parents and spread them to dry in the hot sun.
Yes, and security. What a safe haven the country is. You can rest assured no harm gets to you unless, of course, it was pre-destined. Yes, the country lacks streetlights and equipped security agents (and agencies). But it has more than made up for this with the abundance of vigilantes. Perhaps the only precautionary measure needed as a citizen living in his country is ensuring you get home before night time or, better still, to not step out of the house at all so you’re not noticed by haters. You may also decide to walk around with a rifle or an equivalent – at all times. You snooze, you lose.
This is a country many are leaving for other places even when nowhere can be like home. Nigeria doesn’t feel the same because many loved ones have gone out to hunt for greener pastures. Maybe everybody should come back and let’s enjoy these developments together.

How to boost your IGR if you run a university in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-boost-your-igr-if-you-run-a-university-in-nigeria/,2023-10-21T12:12:05+01:00,"By:Bello Hussein Adoto
Times are hard. Allocation is not enough. And, as a university administrator, you must balance your books. If you worry about how you are going to do that, worry no further: I’m here to help. Start with these five steps.
1. Inflate acceptance fees.
Why not? You didn’t force anyone to apply.
2. Introduce fees for things students will never use.
Yes, things like WiFi and e-library. You know the works. Good internet access would only make students lazy. They should go to the library like you did in the olden days. It doesn’t matter if your library has outdated books. You’ll restock later.
3. Force students to pay for manuals “they’ll get at the end of the semester”.
Make the manuals a hundred pages long to fulfil all righteousness. They’ll use a few pages, but you must justify the fees.
4. Charge them for convocation even if convocation materials will not go around.
Even the best universities cannot cater to everyone, so you are not expected to do magic. So, ask everyone to pay, but gowns would be first come, first served. Those who don’t have gowns can wear agbada. Or suit.
5. Bake bread.
They say man must not live by bread alone, but that is because they’ve not tasted your bread. Make your own so tasty that students can’t help but live on it.
Print your university’s motto on the label. Let the bread carry the university spirit and excellence. Don’t forget to add pure water, too.
Do these five things. Your students will remain loyal, and your IGR will rise… like bread."
The UNIBEN Twitter Swindler and how to deal with smooth talkers like him,https://punocracy.com/the-uniben-twitter-swindler-and-how-to-avoid-people-like-him/,2023-10-17T09:59:00+01:00,"By:Esther Omoye
Every Eke market day, there always seems to be a buzz about Uniben on Twitter. If it’s not stories about themen demreign duringEkosodinold glory days, it is about the revolutionary protests against school policies or some well-told passed-down school tale with small pepper from the New Beninmarket to spice up the wholeOtakhiyeke. But interestingly, some days ago, the focus seemed to have shifted to a swindler on a rampage on Twitter.
The so-called Twitter Swindler is Iriodalo Emmanuel Obhafuoso, a graduate of the Uniben Demonstration Secondary School and Uniben. Odalo used Twitter to meet multiple women and then he established lines of interactions while maintaining the same profile of being a well-travelled and brilliant man. Ultimately, most of these women sent money to him whilst he ran from one lecture theatre to another for his Eco classes on the Ugbowo campus.
How did he manage to get away with it for so long?
Like a trust fund beneficiary off the Fred Ajudua script, Odalo appeared skilful, jumping from one method to another to keep his scheme running. He obviously had his demographic target of women on Twitter and maintained a low profile for as long as he could until he was exposed some days back by one of his victims.
What kind of scam was it?
Odalo apparently followed a pattern: Sometimes, he would send mildly flirty messages to the inboxes of these women, describing himself as a financial analyst, or he’d send a couple of pictures of himself in his infamous black turtleneck shirt in fancy places. And other times, he would enquire if they were single with that overly-confident-Uniben-boy-rizz that puts us off most times and slowly build a relationship with them. His accusers claim that at a certain point, Odalo would confide in them that he was suffering from a heart condition that needed surgical attention or share a peculiar birthday wish list from his younger sister. Eventually, he would send a picture of his chats with his younger sister, and once that groundwork had been laid, he would get money for his heart condition and items off this birthday wish list.
How much money did he steal?
As of 22:17 p.m., October 13, 2023, there was yet to be an official estimate. But he seemingly has scammed more than 20 Twitter women, with one of them talking about a go-fund-me she organised for his surgery that amounted to her giving him the sum of N4 million.
How did he get caught?
Eventually, one of Odalo’s long-term victims turned the tables on him by sharing pictures of him and their chats on Twitter. After the story went viral, he took a break from his jet flights and deactivated his account.
If he only has a job on most days:Odalo described himself asa financial analyst on most dayswithout further establishing any facts about his job. He rather shared other information about the problems in his life to keep most of these women in a pity chokehold.
If he only has pictures taken in fancy places:I know, right? Why should this be an indicator? Most swindlers appropriate a fancy lifestyle to get their victims comfortable around the idea that they’re financially buoyant. Odalo used this same tactic, taking pictures in fancy places while smiling like he had won the lottery.
If he’s Edo and wears a black turtleneck:The Devil Wears Black Turtle Neck.We all know Benin harbours a secret gateway to hell on an average sunny day, so tell me why a Benin boy is confidently wearing a black turtleneck indoors. It will all make sense very soon.
If he is well-traveled and without pictures:Pictures are like a golden circle; they tell more stories than anything. Odalo confidently talked about his travelling experiences with some of these women, significantly across 26 countries, without any pictures to show for it except his black-turtlenecked pictures. Who visits Paris without pictures at the Eiffel? Who goes to the UK without wanting to visit the Big Ben? If the pictures are not on his Instagram feed, they should be in his gallery. Uncle, share them with me. I want to awwwn at your pictures.
If he has throwback rap videos on YouTube:Odalo might have introduced himself to Twitter women as a songwriter to C and D list artists, but one thing he failed to mention was that he had left a failed rapping career behind. A budding M.I., one Benin boy with nothing but his rap dream and hoodie in a 2019 Martell Rap Challenge video on YouTube.
Check for him on the streets of Twitter:Why should Twitter trust someone you’re talking to if you already do? I mean, Twitter can be infamous, but if there’s one thing they’re bound to do right, it’s to eat up a background check like Benin erosion eats up every road. And if this check had possibly been carried out? They most likely would have found out that Odalo was a repeat offender; inside that evian, another evian dey inside.He had similarly pulled a N400,000 scam with his secondary school classmates from 2014, claiming the urgent need for a heart surgery he never went through with in a recently shared video — showing him yet again in his infamous black turtleneck.
If he immediately starts billing you:I mean, if it’s an ick for dem girls to bill dem boys during talking stages, it should be a bigger ick for us dem girls. There’s literally nothing wrong with spending on a man you like, but one who immediately starts billing you?Broda lahor wowo.Odalo made sure he never missed billing these women early on with several stories. So doing, he successfully scammed them on a continuous basis.
If he suddenly has too many healthissues:I mean, I understand our health can fail us in the most drastic way and even unexpectedly, and it’s not always easy to seek fundraising online, but why are you suddenly in need of costly procedures when we start talking? From spinal surgery to heart surgery? Ahhh! Na which baba do the jazz?
If he or his sister have a birthday wish list:Wetin we no go see again? Lmao! Wasn’t it a couple of months back that women were being dragged on Twitter for having birthday wish lists? Well, I bring to you the queen of birthday wish lists: Iriodalo Emmanuel Obhafuoso. Odalo had a birthday wish list and using a system best known to him, he got his wishes fulfilled by several of his victims to the extent of having a newly bought PS5.
If he has over-the-toprizz:We all like a smooth talker, someone who can hold conversations. But there is always an over-the-top mark. One peculiar trait Odalo harnessed was his being very corny and having notice-me humour. Baba was doing 45 press-ups in a minute with his humour and you could just see him straining.
If he uses rap songs as punch lines:Who would have thought? That a day would come when I’d be laughing off the lyrics ofChamillionaire’s Ridin? In one of the chats, Odalo swiftly told a knock-knock joke, continuing with lines from Ridin, hoping the unsuspecting beautiful woman would complete the song’s lyrics. And my girlies, I can’t help but say that if he drops a rap song as a punchline in your inbox, give him a 360 analysis before spitting your own bars.
If he thinks he is the best thing since the leaf rice at Physical Sciences:Obe to dun, owo lo pa!Nobody! Nobody in Uniben can disapprove of Mama’s food. Everybody in school knows that’s the meanest plug, and that’s why I’m so angry. This man probably thinks he is the best thing that has happened since Mama’s leaf rice in Uniben. You could see it in his pictures during his time in school and even afterwards. A sort of I-am-best-thing-in-the-world-since-Mama-Physical-Sciences-leaf-rice aura? And that’s impossible. Confidence is an admirable trait, but an overconfident man online?
If he has been single for almost two years with a dead ex:May her soul rest in peace. It is easily said, but rightly so, the longer they are single, the more chances they are a bad match. Girl, if he’s been single for two years, and most especially with a dead ex, please, as you’re paying your last respects, ask the right questions. Odalo described himself as single for two years with a dead ex to one of his victims, perusing the idea of grief and placing her on a pedestal, while theinnocent sistais probably busy at New Benin market on a Tuesday night, picking up some very goodokrika. Chei!
If he pumps out of thin air like a typical Benin genie:This! Nobody comes out of thin air. This is not Aladdin and the genie lamp. If a random man texts you on Twitter, he’s been observing you; he’s been keeping tabs on you. The first thing you should do if someone like this texts you is to go through their feed and your mutuals, and if there is nothing to be worried about, be on the low so nobody flies away with your funds in a magical carpet.
Pray to God for a natural detector:I see people blaming these women and calling them unintelligent for falling into the hands of Odalo, especially during such hard times. If there’s one thing I’ve always prayed for, it is a discerning spirit for myself and my girlies. I never would have thought I would be praying for a natural detector against a Twitter Swindler. Anyone could have fallen victim to Odalo, and it is not a matter of it-could-never-have-been-me. Today, it is Odalo. Yesterday, it was someone else. We don’t know who will be next.
If he has only a job on most days, ask him about his job every day:Question him, ask him about his colleague, about his boss, his role and what he does on the other days. Make him understand you want to know every single detail about his job.
Ask for pictures in workplaces, at home, with friends, and a possible video call: Now, if there are enough pictures and videos. Make video calls.
He should send you pictures of places he has been to:If he is well-traveled, he should send you more than a couple of pictures of the places he has been to. And if he isn’t a picture person, that’s alright. Ask him when his next trip is and ask him to take one and do a tour video of the destination as a favour.
Do a background check:I know this isn’t always easy, but do a sweep. Across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and, of course, Twitter. Get to know them from their interactions with other people, with their likes, tweets and retweets. Still clean?
Counter-bill him: Nobody, not even women, should be billing men they’ve just met. This should be a big turn-off for anyone. If he bills you immediately after you start talking, tell him about your imaginary problems and bill him.If person give you, you sef go collect.
Recommend he seeks alternative help:I know we only live once, and yes, health is precious. And it isn’t bad at all to want to help someone you’re getting to know, but always seek guidance. In most circumstances, you might not have the emergency funds. Tell him about other options, about going public, while still discussing other means of helping — especially considering how, in recent times, there have been some exposed health scams on Twitter.
If he or his younger sister have a birthday wish list:For years, Nigerian men have shamed Nigerian women for having birthday wish lists and posting these online with the hope that someone buys something off it. And a Nigerian man is sharing one with you? During a talking stage? Gently tell him off, and get him a gift of your understanding. Talking stages are not for birthday wish lists; roses are red, violets are blue, but birthday wish lists shouldn’t be tolerated during talking stages.
If he tries too hard, question him:There’s literally nothing more suspicious than a man who tries too hard online. Efforts are an A+, but if he’s trying too hard? You might just want to guard yourself before considering his efforts.
If he has been single for a while, do the drill:Odalo wouldn’t be the first person who has successfully swindled women with theI’ve been single for yearsplot.Why should this be a checker? When anyone could be genuinely single for years, most swindlers create this world of being single for a couple of years to neutralise their relationship status and create a dead-end in their past. Once this neutral ground is established, there is always access to further romanticise your connection.
If he love-bombs you, ask him to start with paper roses and a first date:How do you know if you’re being love-bombed? If he over-communicates his love for you. This is mostly done with excessive flattery and extreme displays of attention. These love-bombing actions should be a red flag right away. However, you may catch yourself second-guessing them because they might appear loving. But love-bombing is manipulative. An over-the-top love declaration from a man you just met online should be carefully entertained; you never can tell.
If he appears out of nowhere:I’m a firm believer that nobody just appears out of nowhere, and I know Twitter algorithms work like a 9-5 job, but you always have to be on the lookout. If he is a mutual, why the sudden interest? Why you? What changed? Always keep the questions coming for you. Twitter has ushered in a lot of love stories, but the questions should always be there because you can never quite tell a lover from a swindler.

We are definitely happier and luckier than our forefathers,https://punocracy.com/we-are-definitely-happier-and-luckier-than-our-forefathers/,2023-10-10T01:29:58+01:00,"By:Sophie Ay
Come to think of it; we are happier than our forefathers ever were. I dare say we are even luckier. Thanks to history, we have clearly seen that no better generation ever had it all like us. Our ‘white’ education was a priceless gift from our colonisers, even if some people did pay for it with tears, oil and blood. Hundreds of moons after and in our darkest hours came electricity; the very one we are so fond of hailing our dearest NEPA for. Let’s just agree the invention of electricity, orlightas we came to call it in Naija, was a gift our forefathers badly missed out on. They would have never understood the accounting skills it takes for the NEPA people to bring the monthly bills at incredulous charges after months of no power. Surely, talks of transformers blowing up and government-owned poles falling after a warm breeze might have given them heart attacks, too.
I can almost picture my great great great grandfather in the late 1800s smoking his pipe in his thatched hut lit by an old paraffin lamp … oh, how sad he must have been, unable to see in the night.
After light, we were givenwitchy-witchy airplanes by the Americans,awon oyibo. I’m talking about those aeroplanes that fly people abroad, not the ones used for wars. I think our forefathers were not lucky people … because how else can you explain them missing out on plane crashes, hikes in air ticket prices, and the thrill of staring out of a plane as it flies high in the sky? Even awon iya can’t get that high, and they are the caretakers of the world, for that matter. Anyways, without the gift of air transport, I bet we won’t ever be this connected to our colonisers … that we now dare to enter their precious kingdom without chains, guns and violence. To think, in the past, our forefathers needed slave ports and now we … simplepass ports. Gradually from being a luxury only the rich could afford, it is now something we have in our country. Imagine that! We now own our own airplanes. Yes, we didn’t manufacture them but they are still ours.
I like to think of Democracy as a cake. Something our forefathers could only dream of. But here we are, happily licking the icing on the cake like children. I do not know much about colonialism but from the little I have seen of those elections held every four years; our forefathers wouldn’t have had the heart to live through 16 demanding years under the people’s party and eight toxic years with the ones who promised change. Surely, they would have all picked up their canes, red caps, and agbada and matched to the Big Rock in Abuja to remove the one they call president. They had no patience like us; they know not that dealing with those owners of democracy takes suuru, as the Yorubas call it. After all, Nigerian democracy is clearly of the government, by the government, and for the government. It’s ironic how they make us think we are the ones giving them the cake, but while we watch, they feed and feed, letting crumbs fall off the platter for us, the masses. These crumbs are what our parents eat, lick their hands and leave small pieces for us, the children.
If history accounts well as we have seen in movies and read in novels, our forefathers sadly didn’t know God. They called on Sango, Ogun, Obatala, Barbushe, Tsimburbura, Amadioha, including Esu. They were ‘robbed’ of sacrifices by the spirits, and even gave those priests good produce from their farms. ‘Religion is not a business,’ our saintly leaders tell us, so we only give from our hearts. Our forefathers would never have understood this difference. Their hearts were sadly not happy enough to see what you and I see when we make those donations and offerings at the altar and mosques. They would have questioned the authority of our sanctimonious priests to speak for God, something, as true worshippers, we will never do. Religion is quite different from faith; I tell you, they had faith and we own religion … the one-way ticket to heaven.
Tell me, aren’t we indeed luckier?
Our 2000s came with mobile phones and social media, two strange words that wouldn’t have settled in with our forefathers at all. They are probably rolling in the ground right now, wondering what madness we are pulling on Facebook, the cruise we are catching on Twitter, sorry … X, the lies we post as stories on WhatsApp, or why we worship influencers on Instagram and stay glued to dance videos on TikTok. They would never have understood the joy and excitement that comes from subscribing on our phones to stay online all day and watch influencers live the lives we wish were ours, or how we enjoy celebrities drag each other online, or the happiness we derive from reading the latest scandals and gossips, some untrue and others, not our business.
Given these divine blessings, I bet our forefathers surely wouldn’t think of anonymously posting a friend’s secret online, sharing a partner’s sex tapes or having international romantic affairs with women born to our colonisers. They would never have enjoyed all the benefits which we have now. To them, social media would have just been a bad influence, causing mass media destruction, juvenile delinquency, and family breakups.
Before us, marriage used to be a stay-or-die affair with our forefathers, but now, we get to choose when to stay or leave … even divorce comes with itsgoodies. We are now freer to decide who to love, whether it’s a good, married neighbour with three kids and a pregnant wife or some stranger with a cute profile on Facebook. Trust me; our freedom is so free that we do not need to seek any counsel before courtship or marriage; we just dive in and dive out if it’s not pleasant … Trial and error style.
Let’s not forget how youths like me love more than Romeo and Juliet ever did; there’s toasting, romance, paying bills and going shopping, ghosting, and so much breakfast to go around. This is something our forefathers would never have understood, especially the popular saying that the net is so large to just kick one ball without trying the others. Yeah, we love. We love deeply; ourselves, not others, if that’s what you were thinking. And don’t call it selfish; it’s self-love, which brings up another interesting word: self-identity. Our forefathers couldn’t express their interests personally. Heck, they didn’t have the liberty to decide whether to be a strong man this minute or a feminine woman the next, nor choose to be a woman after being born a man. I tell you, we are freer than any other generation that ever lived.
Have you noticed how just anyone can just go online and decide to say anything they want without fear of retribution? That’s free speech, darling. The power to speak or pass information without censorship. In our forefathers’ time, they probably couldn’t look the Oba straight in his eyes without being beheaded, question the orders of the Igwe without fear of execution or demand the impeachment of the Sultan without facing banishment. But we enjoy that freedom so easily.
In our era, we can hide behind the safety of our phones and lie about things we have no evidence about. We can chase after clouds and speak vividly about incidents somewhere up North while living in Lagos. Our freedom of speech is so free that we are never held accountable for defamation, misinformation and disinformation, the very factors ruining our country. Mind you, we do love a good protest. There is this sense of patriotism we feel when we march for a peaceful protest, fighting for a cause that we surely know nothing of — actions our elders in the office like to scold us for. Our forefathers from the 1900s defended their societies. On the other hand, we only raise our voices for peace, but not our flags for the country.
The sweetest thing about our time is that there’s always somethingtrending. Celebrity dragging, notorious kidnapper, failed attempt to smuggle drug by a celebrity, disappearance of school children, hijack of a moving train, fake certificate saga, political kerfuffle, Ebola begets COVID-19, Emefelefele and his new notes, ritual killings, yahoo boys uprising, sex tape scandals, and the many many shows that entertain and educate us … BBAFRICA, BBNAIJA, and we are waiting on the next big brothersha.
When you add fuel subsidy removal, inflation, a tiny per cent of employment, poor power supply and a host of other things, it’s no surprise many Nigerians like tojapaon time. They are so concerned about the country, I think, they are going abroad to learn the secrets of how other people, including our colonial masters, run their countries well. I’m sure after working for years, they will return to further make our Naija a happy place. Something our forefathers could never have done … they went as slaves, worked for years and never returned. I feel so bad for them.
Now, didn’t I tell you we are happier than our forefathers ever were?
Indeed, we are luckier."
Travel advisory for Naijirians going to Parees,https://punocracy.com/travel-advisory-for-naijirians-going-to-parees/,2023-10-10T00:52:23+01:00,"By:Bello Hussein Adoto
The Naijirian government hereby advises her citizens going to Parees to reconsider their travel in the light of bedbug infestation in the city. The bedbugs carry a high risk of sucking your blood, disturbing your sleep, undermining your confidence, and making you unproductive — all of which we care deeply about.
This notice also cautions against using Pareesian taxis, trains, wears, furniture, and, indeed, anything that may have been touched by the Pareesian sun.
We have reasons to believe that the bedbugs may be in other nearby cities. Given the discrete nature of the insects, they can sneak to nearby cities undetected. Therefore, do not travel to Saint-King, Gently, Montrouge, Malacough, Bagnolee, and Coup-rbevoie.
Bedbugs are stubborn, blood-sucking insects that can stain your white. The small, brown, wingless insects can hide in bags and seats through which they get to you. Use your brain. Don’t use your strong head to go out and bring bedbugs to your house.
While we watch the situation as it develops, we urge Naijirians already in Parees to be extra cautious in their movements across the city. Embassy channels remain open for round-the-clock communication. Support is available at our designated centres. Do not hesitate to reach out to us.
Please stay where you are if you have bedbugs in your home. Reach out to a local pest control unit for assistance. Don’t call us. We have other things to do than deal with other people’s bedbugs.
We stand by our ally Phrans as they resolve their bedbug issue. We hope they will adopt better hygienic practices and keep their cities clean. The ambassador is communicating with his Phrench counterpart to send experts from our sparkling and bedbug-free cities to help the City of Bedbugs, sorry, City of Lite, as they go through these dark times of bedbug infestation.

"When it comes to NEPA, the change begins with your change-over",https://punocracy.com/when-it-comes-to-nepa-the-change-begins-with-your-change-over/,2023-09-23T12:28:25+01:00,"By:Ojingiri Hannah
Do you know that moment when everything is enveloped in darkness, and the mysterious silhouette of a woman hovers over you? Fear begins to take root within you, with thoughts of impending destruction you’ve yet to fathom. A sudden hum sends shivers down your spine, causing goosebumps to form on your skin. But alas, it’s all in your imagination—a world you awaken to that seeks to steal your peace. Yet you refuse to succumb to your inner turmoil until the lights come on and banish all fears. “Ah! Finally,” you exclaim. “Up NEPA!”
The respite is, however, short-lived. The joy of seeing everything in your small room and watching your favourite show on Netflix is fleeting. They toggle the power on and off as if it were a toy they were given to play with as children. At the NEPA office, they chant their slogan before restoring power, “You foolish people, we are about to turn on the light for you.” And when they shut it off again, another slogan resounds, “Back to sender, all your curses are not for us.”
They grumble about their salaries, shifting the blame to the government. But it doesn’t end there; they have a series of other slogans they use before providing electricity to the community. They move from one neighbourhood to another, extracting money even when they haven’t fulfilled their duty of delivering power. Like pests, they feed on the people, leaving them in utter darkness.
The dismal state of NEPA leaves you in a state of half-sleep half-wakefulness, and every moment spent with your gadgets requires a quick glance at the bulb. Even in your deepest slumber, as soon as your fan, which sounds like a grinding machine, kicks in without rhyme or reason, you instinctively reach for your phone, half-awake, and plug it in before aimlessly returning to your bed to resume from where you left off.
Illusion has gripped both the youth and adults alike. The moment the cry of “Up NEPA!” echoes through the area, everyone rushes to their windows to ask their neighbours the daunting question, “Is there light?” Even those whose switches are already on can’t resist the urge to ask the same silly question.
NEPA has indeed consumed the souls of Nigerians, where having electricity becomes a curse, and the curse persists even without it. Regardless of what NEPA does, they can’t seem to satisfy you. Like a never-ending cycle, the struggles of Nigerians in perpetual darkness persist.
On most weekends, adults find themselves comparing their country to others and yearning for a nation where light illuminates every corner. Perhaps then, crime rates would decrease, and businesses would thrive even more. That’s how they conclude their weekends, burdened by the state of Nigeria in their hearts. Every time the lights come on when their moods align, they express gratitude with a simple “Thank God.”
But NEPA remains unmoved; it’s their domain, and whether you rejoice when you see the light or not, they remain undeterred. Change will only come when something else replaces them—perhaps solar power.

On Portable and Nigeria’s learned fighters,https://punocracy.com/on-portable-and-learned-fighters/,2023-09-16T09:35:32+01:00,"By:Bello Hussein Adoto
Portable and lawyers do not make a good match at first glance. But when you look at it again, the two may have more in common than they would admit. Aberrant lawyers are responsible for this similarity.
Many scoffed at Portable when he showed up to perform at the 2023 NBA Annual General Conference in Abuja. They consider him uncultured, despicable, and unworthy to perform in a comity of learned men, renowned for their refined elegance. Matching Portable and lawyers should have been an inborn error that ended as a stillbirth. But it didn’t. Portable performed… to the dismay of many.
However, events before, during, and after the conference suggest that the two may not be a mismatch after all. Portable fought with Area Boys in Ogun state last year. That same year, some learned silks were busy looting bags and conference souvenirs in Lagos.
This year, the men in wigs behaved like Portable and turned into what Mrs. Onikepo Braithwaite called “learned fighters.” Footballers representing Abuja and Onitsha branches of the prestigious NBA allegedly engaged in a free-for-all, not with their wigs and silks of course, but you get the point. A few days after the conference, the executives were busy exchanging polemics about how money changed hands, à la Portable and Kogbagidi.
Lawyers are honourable, distinguished, and prestigious people. They are renowned for their refined intellect and wit, poise and conduct. They represent the best of most societies. That’s why they have a professional code of conduct for members. In 2021, the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (LPDC) sanctioned 11 lawyers for professional misconduct; five were disbarred. That’s the conservative nature of the profession.
The problem is not with lawyers or the NBA per se; it’s with the system that doesn’t seem to take discipline issues very seriously, especially outside the court. If the 2022 looters of Lagos were caught and reprimanded, and the errors that led to loot were addressed, we may not have had fighters of Abuja in 2023. I’m glad a coach and a player have been punished for the Abuja embarrassment. At least we will not have to expect a royal rumble in 2024!
It is tough managing the largest bar in Africa. There will always be aberrant lawyers despite the existence of professional codes of conduct. Lawyers, after all, are humans too. But that they are humans doesn’t mean their gross misconduct is allowed to fester. You either punish bad behaviour, or it becomes a vice that perishes the system that failed to enforce order.
When some lawyers start to behave recklessly and executives exchange dirty laundry in public, and we don’t see any decisive step to correct it, you will realise why Portable is a good fit for their conference. It’s the open season. Let Portable celebrate with the silks. Let Ìdààmú àdúgbò dance with ìdààmú àgbejoro. It’s the clown meeting the gown.

Radio talk: ‘The election tribunal decision will favour me and my family’,https://punocracy.com/radio-talk-the-election-tribunal-decision-will-favour-me-and-my-family/,2023-09-09T07:40:51+01:00,"By:Waliyullah Tunde Abimbola
OAP:(to Barrister) Thank you for your contribution, Barrister. Now, we will open the line for callers to contribute. The topic we have been discussing is: Ahead of the election tribunal judgement, what is your opinion? You already know the rules. Move away from your radio set. Do not use swear words. Remember, we are in the state of the ọmọlúàbí[1]. And mention your name and where you are calling from. Hello, good morning.
Caller 1:Good morning. I am Mrs Akanbi from Temidire Estate. I always enjoy your programmes.
OAP:Thank you very much, Mrs Akanbi. What do you have to say about the issue on ground?
Caller 1:As you are a talker, may your mouth never put you in trouble. May people continue to listen to your programme in their numbers. Your mouth, which is sweet now, may it never become bitter. Keep up the good work. (Ends the call.)
OAP:Thanks, Mrs Akanbi, for the prayers. Good morning. Your name and where are you calling from?
Caller 2:Good morning. This is Kunle from Osogbo. If the knife is thrown into the air two hundred times, it will always land on its flat side. It is Awisaju all the way. Thank you.
OAP:All right. Mr Kunle from Osogbo thinks the tribunal judgement will favour President Balo Amhed Tibunu. Before we take the next call, Barrister, what do you think…
Caller 3:(interrupts) Abbey?
OAP:Good morning. You are on Wave FM talk show.
Caller 3:Nonso? You get Honda Accord chassis?
OAP:(Ends the call.) There must have been a mixup there. So, as I was saying Barrister, what do you think …
Caller 4:Good morning.
OAP:Good morning, sir. Your name and where you are calling from.
Caller 4:I am Pastor Elegbeleye from Oke-Oniti.
OAP:What do you have to say about the topic, sir?
Caller 4:I wish to tell my fellow Nigerians that it does not matter who wins the case. What matters is that we should plead to God to look favourably at Nigeria. Our sins are much. Psalm 127 verse 1 says, “Unless the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.” I urge all Nigerians to let us fast on the day of the judgement. When the judgment has been pronounced, we can break the fast. May God take control of this country. It shall be well with us.
OAP:Amen. Pastor Elegbeleye from Oke-Oniti says we should be prayerful. Another caller now. Hello.
Caller 5:Hello. This is Tosin from Dada Estate.
OAP:Good morning, Mr Tosin. What do you have to say regarding the topic?
Caller 5:The evidence on ground has shown that Petre Ibo is going to win the case. All the discrepancies in the election have been revealed. Let Batman dust his wings in preparation to fly away from Osa Rock. As for Akuti, he is only frying Ibo’s fish for him. All of his effort … going to Cargo University to disprove certificates, all of it will be in vain. Ibo is the rightful heir to the throne. I congratulate Petre Ibo and Nigerians in advance. Thank you.
OAP:Mr Tosin from Dada Estate thinks Petre Ibo will win. Another caller. Hello.
Caller 6:Hello. All those politicians, they are …
OAP:Please, your name first and where you are calling from, ma.
Caller 6:I am Iya Iyabo from Agunbelewo. You see all those politicians (pauses for a centisecond), they are good-for-nothing never-do-wells. If not so …
OAP:(Ends the call.) Dear callers, please do not use swear words when talking on air. We mentioned that at the beginning of this segment. Let us follow the instructions. Hello, your name and where you are calling from.
Caller 7:I am Lukman from Iragbiji.
OAP:What do you have to say concerning the topic, Mr Lukman?
Caller 7:I have nothing to say concerning the topic. But I have something important to say. I don’t know about the rest of you, but as for me, I am not used to this subsidy removal yet. (A bit slower) When they removed the subsidy, they said it was for the sake of the future. They said that the money would be used to do other beneficial things in the country. Or is that not what they said? Some of them even brought up the example of Russia. They said Russia suffered too before it became an industrial nation, so we have to suffer a little too before we start to enjoy. Agreed. Now, what I want to ask is that: The person whose head is used to break a coconut, can such a person eat from the coconut, Mr Presenter?
OAP:(in agreement) Hm.
Caller 7:Can he? No. If half of the population will die before the enjoyment comes or if they have sunken too deep in poverty, then what good will enjoyment do to them? And which enjoyment? Will we become America overnight just because we remove subsidy? Hehn, Barrister?
Barrister:No.
Caller 7:No. Which leads me to my second point. This subsidy money that we have set aside, how do we know… or let me put it like this, how can we be sure that it won’t suffer the same fate that all government funds suffer? Will the President say to the other politicians, “Come, guys, let us not tamper with this money like the rest”?
OAP:Thank you very much for your contribution, Mr Lukman from Iragbiji.
Caller 7:(entreatingly) One last thing, please. I will be very quick. This rice that they are sharing. They said it cost them five billion naira, and the rice cannot reach anywhere. Nobody in my neighbourhood got it. You see, everything the woman that called before me said about politicians is true. Later, they will say …
OAP:(Ends the call.) Thanks for your contribution, Mr Lukman. Sorry for that. Time is not on our side. We will take one more caller now. Hello, your name and where you are calling from.
Caller 8:I am Owoyemi from Osu. Please don’t cut the call. I beg you in the name of God, don’t cut the call.
OAP:(hesitant) Okay, I won’t. What do you have to say, Mr Owoyemi?
Caller 8:(very quickly) I beg you, well-meaning Nigerians, help me. I have not eaten since yesterday. I had an accident in February while trying to escape kidnappers on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. I have been unable to work since then. I borrowed ₦100 from NTM to call into this programme. In fact, I am ready to sell this phone that I am calling with. It is an Ilet A23. Bring any amount. I live at number 5, Oodua street, Osu. Help me, please. My account number is 0123456779. Gold Bank. Taiwo Owoyemi Adigun. Please, I beg you in the name of God. Thank you as you help. (Ends the call.)
Barrister:What a pity.
OAP:Indeed. We thank all our callers. We will be rounding off the programme now. I thank our Producer …
Caller 9:(cuts in) Hello. This is Raymond from Old Garage. Please play me Odogwu by Godwin Omighale.
OAP:Mr Raymond, this is not a music programme. (Ends the call.) Thank you for your time, Barrister. To our listeners, thanks for your attention. We meet same time, same station tomorrow morning. Stay blessed.
End.

"‘The outrageous dress code circular is not from us, but expect our version soon,’ Oh-Hey-You clarifies",https://punocracy.com/the-outrageous-dress-code-circular-is-not-from-us-but-expect-our-version-soon-oh-hey-you-clarifies/,2023-09-02T08:52:47+01:00,"By:Olabode Olwaufemi
TheOh-Hey-Youmanagement has debunked the viral dress code circular, which sprouted several reactions on social media in the late hours of Sunday, adding that even though it has no idea where it came from, it is working on the official version — which sources say may be just as bad.
The widely circulated document outlawed misconducts such as putting on “sexually provocative dresses, backless clothes, transparent wears, off-shoulder clothes, bomb shorts,” and so on. Unwelcome kissing, hugging and touching of the opposite sex, massaging and sitting on the laps of the opposite sex are also not allowed, with the penalties ranging from rustication for one or two semesters.
The Yunifasiti P-aR-rOw, speaking with a mainstream media outlet on Sunday, stated that the circular didn’t emanate from the in-stew-tuition, although the management is considering a review of the dress code policy.
“It is not from the university administration. Although we are working on our own, I think those who brought that out are just being mischievous. Maybe they are trying to gauge the minds of the people and the students, but definitely, this is a university and we cannot accept any kind of dress; we have decency.”
But our sources confirmed that the “mischievous” people trying to gauge the minds of the public may not be too far from the senate building.
Meanwhile, an internal memorandum from the Yunifasiti’s legal review committee dated August 8th, 2023, called for the review of the code of conduct and dress code for students in the in-stew-tuition. It reads: “The University is in the process of reviewing some of its administrative instruments as well as putting in place a security policy. In particular, (i) the code of conduct for the university community (made in 1990) and (ii) the dress code for students in the university (made in 2002) are due for review, and there is a draft ‘University Security Policy’ for consideration.”
The management, similarly, in the early hours of Tuesday, via the in-stew-tuition’s official social media handles, directed that the circular should be disregarded as it didn’t emanate from the Yunifasiti. “The University, therefore, would urge all students, parents, guardians and all stakeholders to disregard the document in circulation, as the authors of the said circular were being deliberately mischievous and disruptive.”
But despite the debunk, students still believe this is more of a thriller, and the real movie is coming to the cinema soon."
An old man’s sleep talk,https://punocracy.com/an-old-mans-sleep-talk/,2023-08-26T10:58:40+01:00,"By:Abdullahi Jimoh
Act I, Scene I
At about 3:00 a.m., just before dawn on Wednesday, 15th of March, 2023, a chocolate-coloured old man, with a bald head, deserted beard and moustache, baggy face and fading eyes, stretches on his bed made of gold in his well-furnished master bedroom and begins a sleep talk that lasts for two hours. The white blanket that shields half of his body before now folds out over his uncontrolled stretch.
Hmm. I know I’m more reserved than many people thought. I laboured all my years to play the role of a barman in the beer parlour of politics. I served the dark one, the light, even the short and tall, not leaving out the slim and the lardy, making them all eat to their satisfaction because I know where I was heading. Thankfully, I had enough resources to play the long game, from my pill-pushing and other businesses.
I’m a big player in this game. Many years back, that renowned tyrant and head of state wanted to get rid of me, but I ran into exile along with many other people to dodge his bullet. He used to feed on blood. The moment the news of his death hit the air, I returned to my father’s land. This time, I came back to lie to people to cast their votes and get me the power I wanted.
Fortunately, I secured the post and stayed the maximum number of years the constitution allowed. Then, I threw in a left-handed man to move on from where I stopped. Whether people enjoyed my time or not, I don’t care.
I know that that left-handed man I helped in is a radical and revolutionist. It makes me proud when people hail him. I can boast that he used the template I built.
He copied me to spend the maximum number of years permissible. Then, I still coopted another rotund man to have his own taste of the wine. But he fucked up! After the first term, I flogged him out so he could not sniff the seat for another four years. After that, I handed it over to a chess-lover. He is a good man and a loyalist who pays his dues regularly.
Hurrr.(He yawns again before sleeping off around 5:00 a.m.)
Act I, Scene II
Another sleep talk popped up on Saturday, April 15, 2023.He began this one by 2:30 a.m. and ended by 3:00 a.m. He stretches to the edge of the bed to start the monologue.
They didn’t want me, but I declined. Lately, I’ve been observing the state of things secretly because of my ambition to get into that powerful house. Is it for a single tribe? Am I a fool for transferring a post meant for me to a short, dark, Christian lawyer when he asked me to nominate someone I know? Because, initially, he wanted me to be his surrogate. That lawyer later fuck up for antagonising me, but I showed him that I’m his father in this business.
I was not a fool. But I regret helping him. If not for that jester and dramatic fairly light man from the South-South and that tall huge man in the South West and many helpers, I nearly lost that seat to one of the two men. One of them his origin is not known; the second one used to say he got his advice from a madman. Even if they complain about my policy, I won’t listen. I already have my people who will understand my language as my cabinet members because they are my party men. I’m all right.
Faaaaa. (He farts.) Hurrr. (He yawnsand sleeps off.)

All you need to know about becoming a Nigerian pastor,https://punocracy.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-becoming-a-nigerian-pastor/,2023-08-26T10:09:37+01:00,"By:Mazi Chukwu Okwudili
Do you remember that divine call to preach the gospel to the ends of the world? I know you do. But what you do not know is, considering the thousands of ministries and churches in Nigeria, the instruction seemed to have been given to many other Nigerians as well.
You see, being a pastor in Nigeria is lucrative—a high-paying job. The reason is Nigeria is a vast land full of gullible people with no faith. It is where you are told salvation is free but you need to buy anointing oil, holy water, pastor’s stickers, and even pay for your miracles. Yes, you have to pay for all of these because the Nigerian god blesses based on the measure you give.
Nigeria is economically, politically, and morally naked, and in dire need of clothing. This is where you come in to pitch your tent as a pastor and make a fortune. Didn’t your bible tell you that a “labourer deserves his wages”? Good! Now you know better.
Should you choose to become a Nigerian pastor, bring out your writing pad, book, tablet, slate, or whatever you can lay your hands on and write down these tips.
First, you need to understand that the pastoring business is not for the faint-hearted—you must possess a carnivorous tooth because, in this business,agu na eri agu. Brother no know him brother.
You need to be brutal and crafty unless you want to run out of members and if you run out of members, the game is over – you’ll certainly be out of business. I bet you wouldn’t want that for yourself. The goal is to outperform your competitors.
The next thing is to have a sellable name for your church or ministry. Names like ‘Recover My Lost Glory Ministry’ or ‘Devil Go Collect Wotowoto Glorious Church’. See, whatever name you adopt, make it sellable and relatable to the gullible. Trust me, they will buy it. And don’t forget to adopt personal names like prophet, daddy, apostle, bishop, and/or papa. Your proper name shouldn’t be heard from any mouth unless you want to appear common.
After you have settled on a name, start your church or ministry immediately; it does not matter if you have a building. Just begin with what you have, maybe a kiosk, shop, an open field, or even your sitting room. After all, where two or three are gathered, the god of Nigeria is in your midst. So, just start! Nobody cares, not even the government. Trust me, you are getting there. After all, Rome was not built in one day.
Don’t be afraid to open your church or ministry in a particular place simply because others have done so. Squeeze yourself in. It does not matter if you guys total ten, hundred, or even thousands of churches in that place. Just squeeze in. After all, you have your divine commission, and most importantly, there is fair competition in the pastoring trade. It all depends on how well you can brainwash your converts.
Now, you need to learn how to brainwash. You heard that right, ‘brainwash!’ It is a necessary tool in this business. You will use it to talk gullible members into your church or ministry. When you have mastered the art of brainwashing, you don’t need to bother about what to preach. I don’t need to tell you that these gullible people don’t read their bible. So, you can read a portion of the bible and preach anything that massages their ego.
Now, listen, on no account should you preach salvation or repentance. That’s a no-go area. Nobody would want to be told of his sins or wrongdoings. After all, you don’t want to lose your members to your competitors.
Normalise preaching material wealth, motivational talks, and miracles. After all, the god of Nigeria is a perfect, excellent, miracle-working god and the god of abundant wealth who is only ready to enrich the cheerful givers.
Make sure you drum into them the essence of giving to the lord so the lord can, in turn, bless them. Preach things like the widow’s mite, the measure you give is the measure you receive, he who sows in tears will reap in joy, and so on. Make sure you repeat this over and over again. Let them teach it to their children. This is where your fortune comes from, so let it be cemented in their hearts.
Also, remember to use your pulpit to preach against and drag other pastors and their churches.
Learn to normalise organising vigils, home cell, prayer meetings, crusades, concerts, and just whatever event will make your members congregate. It does not matter if they are impacted; your focus should be the offering.
You need to be innovative in your mode of operation to keep your members glued to your church. Shey you have heard of Amapiano? Create things likeamaprayeroramaworship, anything that flows with the trend. Your gullible members will buy it. And should a natural epidemic like COVID-19 rear its ugly head, you need to also be creative and adjust to the current situation. As you obey the sit-at-home and other government safety protocols, you need to liaise with network providers to create a code where tithe and offering can be paid. You know, you can’t afford to go hungry.
When you have acquired enough riches, quickly buy a private jet; it does not matter if your members go home hungry. That’s not your business. After all, you are not a charitable organization, government, or even Jesus that fed thousands of people. Don’t lose focus; use the jet to bam bam and to chill with the big boys.
But should you choose to think big – to want to expand your business – you are to venture into school or politics. Open schools and make sure it is too expensive for your poor members to afford. What do your members even know? They will never find out that the schools were built with their tithes and offerings. After all, they are gullible.
If it is politics that looks greener and promising, go into it with your full chest even if the form is ₦100 million; tithes and offerings from your members will foot the bill. After all, they no born them well to disobey your order when you have told them that the Nigerian god revealed to you that you would win the election and save the country. You are not Tunde Bakare; you might make it even beyond the primaries. After all, a pastor professor made it to the position of vice president.
Lest I forget, don’t be afraid to get yourself involved in scandals and abominations. You are human. And trust me, when people like me drag you online or anywhere, your gullible members will put out a defence for your foolishness.
Use these tips to enjoy a prosperous pastoring trade. And if you get confused along the line, feel free to knock at my door.

"How to thrive as a Nigerian: A practical, comprehensive guide",https://punocracy.com/how-to-thrive-as-a-nigerian-a-practical-comprehensive-guide/,2023-08-12T13:00:32+01:00,"By:Aniebiet Effiong
What a time to be a Nigerian!
The leaders are hitting the ground running. A time when we know when it is our turn and will have it no other way. A time when the poor is finally allowed to breathe. No more suffocation. The poor are breathing the fresh air of fuel subsidy removal, which has reduced food prices and transport fares and will, in turn, make them grow healthier and live longer. We live in a time when the administration is favouring us and our families. Amen?
This short work is written as a guide for Nigerians who may have forgotten how to go about their various duties or how to live in Nigeria. The country is changing rapidly and it is important to remind ourselves of certain cardinal principles.
For instance, being an oga, you should never attend a meeting, occasion, or event early. It will only create an impression of you being jobless and desperate. People will begin to take you for granted and some may even address you without adding Most Distinguished, His Excellency, Chief, Right Honourable, Prof, to your name. Not after tussling and hustling to acquire those titles should one fool forget to address you properly just because you made the mistake of arriving early. How disrespectful! God forbid!
Nigerians take a big man’s earliness to events or meetings for granted. This will never be your portion. Amen! They should be in anticipation of your arrival. You become more prominent and noticeable when you walk in late. It is more honourable to walk in when all are seated. If it is an event where the MC knows their onions, you could even be given a standing ovation when you arrive. Who knows?
Nigeria as a society is one that has freed itself from all forms of corrupt practices due to the openness, fairness, and transparency of the leaders. And you know, when the leaders are good, the followers follow the same path. We are a good people of a good nation.
What you do with a bottle of water says a lot about you. To buy a bottle of water or to be given during an event — or however you acquire it — is a noble and uncommon thing, which can only be rivalled by being given an expensive wine.
It is one thing to have a bottle of water and another thing to know how to be honourable with it. If you make any silly attempt to consume the water and dispose of the plastic quickly, then you have lost it all. You lose part of the money used in buying and that is economic wastage. You lose your integrity as a human. You lose respect and self-confidence.
Nigerians will accord you some respect when you go about with your bottle, sipping the water in bits. Never be in a hurry to drink everything at once, no matter how thirsty you are. When you are about to talk to a friend, open up and have a sip. Make sure there’s always at least a quarter of the contents left, at which point you can drop it inside your car. That is more honourable.
The only form of water you should consume quickly is sachet water. When you’re done, throw the sachet anywhere; a gutter is preferable, where it can possibly block the drainage and even cause flooding.
Being a cleaner in Nigeria is a beautiful and unforgettable experience one shouldn’t miss. You can work as a cleaner in plenty of places. It’s not like these places are dirty at all. It’s just one of those job opportunities we have in Nigeria. Hence the reason unemployment is at a minimal rate. Statistics can prove this.
As a cleaner in a place like a bank, it shouldn’t have to be included in your job description that your work is more than cleaning banking halls and offices before you know it. If your job is only to keep the place clean, who then will that cashier or manager send on errands? To drop some documents on a fellow colleague’s table for signature or endorsement or whatever. To help him or her get a photocopy from the copier. To buy snacks or food outside the banking vicinity. Who will do these things?
This is just the beauty of being a cleaner in an office or bank. You become so versatile. Hurray!
The good Lord has blessed you with some good voice. It is left to you to use it well. You can charge millions per invitation. After all, the gift of a man makes way for him. This is your own way. A way of wealth! You are a famous minister. A big name. The way you will be introduced or called to the stage will show you this. Once you’re invited to the stage to minister, there are things you must not skip, or else you deprive people of blessings.
Tell the expectant congregation to walk to five people and say, ‘Neighbour, today is going to be great.’ Just find something motivating and say it again. Coin something. Tell them again to walk to 20 people and say something, “Neighbour shift for me.”
“Neighbour, today is your turn.”
“Neighbour, are you ready?”
Note: the ‘neighbour’ is very important. If you like, you can tell them to walk up to 50 people to act on your instruction. They will do whatever you say. Are they tired? That’s none of your business. You’re a guest minister. They need this divine exercise for stability and blessings. Anyone who complains or sits through the exercise must be evil.
It is by special grace that you are a boss with numerous apprentices learning a vocation under you. Here are a few tips for you to follow.
The first thing you must never ever neglect doing once you admit a new apprentice is giving him or her a list of things to bring once he’s done with the huge vocational training payment. The list should include things like crates of soft drinks, a bottle of wine, packs of biscuits, and other stuff you haven’t eaten before in your entire life. The moment they fail to bring these things, it means they are not ready to learn. It’s a tradition one must follow to be able to learn effectively. One does not omit this ritual and end up with mastery of what was taught. It is one thing developed places are missing out on.
On the issue of punctuality, your apprentice must never be a minute late to work. Forget the fact that they paid money to learn from you. The day they come late (even by a tiny bit), then they have signed up for hell. There’s only one befitting punishment and that is kneeling by the roadside with two hands lifted to the sky. Please, I beg you, in the name of whatever you worship, do not skip making them kneel by the roadside to avoid you losing your position as the boss. I repeat: if they do not kneel on the road, then you are finished as the master.
Make the place they kneel very strategic such that they can be easily seen by everything that passes by. This should be done dispassionately regardless of the weather. Under a scorching sun or in the rain would be preferable. It shall never be well with those who say you are a mean or wicked person. Even if you are, how is it their business? People don’t mind their business.
To be a student of a Nigerian public university is something exquisite. Little wonder the Whites find it more appropriate to send their kids to come study in Nigeria. In our public varsities, we have fewer strikes and more studies. When you hear them refer to us as giants of Africa, this is it. Soon we will be referred to as giants of the world.
As a student, when school reopens for another semester or session, do not resume quickly. It’s a sign of being too serious and you know anything done at the extreme is not good. Give yourself two to three weeks before resumption. The lecturers will understand. Any lecturer that wants to teach should go ahead and do so. The culture stands. Any lecturer who begins lectures when you haven’t resumed is mean and will never make heaven.
When the results are out and your colleague or anyone asks for your grade. There are different answers for different grades:
A – B: “I had A” or “I had B of 69” (smile a little). Please be very confident in saying this.
C – F: “They gave me …” Make it look like it’s what you were given and not what you merited. With this format, you will get sympathetic words like, ‘eya … sorry, some lecturers enh!’
It is very typical of lecturers. They do everything to sabotage your efforts and even try to waste your sleeping night. (Sorry for the typo, I meant to say sleepless nights.)
Nonetheless, if you’re into school politics and you’re vying for a position in, let’s say, the Student Union, then your loyalty must be in absolutes. You can even crawl on the floor to exhibit your loyalty to every student. You can always say things like,
‘Your boy is loyal!’
‘Your boy dey o!’
Nigerians love the humility of aspirants during the electioneering period. Haven’t you studied how Nigerian politicians win elections? How they stoop to eat corn with commoners on the road. How they walk into markets to make friends with traders. How they drink cassava flakes with people and even mingle with children in schools.
Please walk around the school compound begging for votes through any means. Make them understand you are going there to protect the interest of the students and the school. Nigerians love promises. You know how Nigerians were promised fuel pump price to be forty naira per litre and it came to fruition?
When you win, make sure you vanish from their sight. Nigerian students and the way they think sometimes baffles me. God will judge anyone who thinks you should still be accessible to people anyhow after your emergence as the SUG President. That is not the template of Nigerian politics and leadership. Everything has its template.
The moment you allow yourself to be seen anyhow, then you have violated the Nigerian political standards. Nigerians don’t love to see their leaders at random. They love seeing them in convoys so they can smile sheepishly and wave their hands at the tinted cars as they blare their sirens. As a president, You will be given a car. This is how ephemeral humility pays.
There are different kinds of lecturers on campuses. I’d strongly advise you to be highly selective about the kind you become to avoid what Nigerians call ‘see finish’ from students. Here’s my kind of lecturer. The kind who is boastful and tough. (As a man, you shouldn’t be too tough on female students, especially those with gracious physiques who occasionally visit your office to say hi.)
Your attendance in class should be minimal. Be rare and scarce. You are an external examiner to so many universities. Your schedule is always filled. As a Prof, you should have pressing issues to attend to and not these irresponsible students. Remember, in your time, what you did was go to national libraries to read.
Go for classes towards the exams period and do whatever you want. Make these students know how tough you are. Make references and tell them to go ask their senior colleagues how you were. You are a no-nonsense man. Endeavour to observe when class attendance is low so that you can give a test. To be a lecturer is not child’s play.
In a country where people are toxic, troublesome, unforgiving and full of hatred, you are obliged to make unlawful detentions. Sorry, I meant lawful arrests. Or whatever. There must be an arrest. This will deter terrorists from their heinous crimes. It will curb heartbreaks and divorces. It will stop electoral malpractices. People will fear you. You can be paid to arrest a neighbour for doing nothing wrong. If money is involved, then nothing is bad about it.
Sometimes, the commissioner may post you on highways to check vehicles and maintain order. Exploit that opportunity to make your own proceeds. Imagine searching the trunk of a vehicle and asking oga to ‘find something for boys’ (whether you find anything incriminating or not) and do this fifty times a day. Imagine the money you and your colleagues would make. You can raise something tantamount to your salary on a daily basis.
If you are urgently called to a crime scene, I beg you, in the name of your wife and children at home, delay a little. Not all crime scenes need prompt intervention. You can arrive after the criminals may have gone. Make sure you use the siren to inform the criminals of your arrival in case they had yet to leave the scene. The national anthem and pledge should only end on your lips and not make your children fatherless or your wife a widow. Forget about Nigerians who criticise you. Nigerians and their misgivings about the police. God will judge those who judge the Police despite knowing that the Police is their friend.
Nonetheless, You see those boys in dreadlocks and ripped jeans, they are Nigeria’s main problem. They are the cause of Nigeria’s incontrollable insecurity, inflation, and poverty. They are a major distraction to the federal government. Arrest them whenever the opportunity shows up. Properly scrutinise their phones. Harass them if you want to.
Everyone driver on dreadlocks, beards, and ripped Jean trousers are suspects and threats. I sincerely sympathise with the future of Nigeria if you do not make this very crucial arrest. Shame on those Oyinbo people who try to mislead some Nigerians that one can go on dreadlocks and be a Pastor. Irreligious people should never make a quest to blindfold a full-blown religious people who talk to their God every week.
Note: If upon your search you find anything incriminating and he decides to find you small joy, please accept and free him. That is not any form of bribery. It is called mercy-showing. He only paid for his sins and you showed him mercy. Have more mercy on those who squeeze something legal and tender into your hand, smiling. Intelligent officer like you. Officer! Officer!
_______________________________________
This work is required of every Nigerian as a tool to guide them on what they do and how they go about their daily routine. It exposes one to the insight that, as a Nigerian, you are born into so many areas of comparative advantage over your contemporaries overseas. It would be rather unfair to your heritage and personality to stay in Nigeria and behave as a British. As the saying goes, when You’re in Rome, act like a Roman. You should be Nigerian in all walks of life.
I, therefore, recommend this work to everyone who is in Nigeria and those intending to come over. Even those taxi drivers at parks should own a copy of this paper. As a taxi driver loading a bus, for example, you must never make the mistake of letting people know there are still many vacant passenger seats. Scream ‘one chance … enter make we go’ at the top of your voice. Try as much as possible to make it look like only one space is left. Before you realise it, your vehicle will be filled to the glory of God.
This is a pattern that has thrived over the years. Nigerians love hope. Nigerians are hopeful and hope-filled. You should take a cue from all the ‘Amen’ they comment on Facebook posts of prophecies of financial blessings from accounts of pseudo-Pastors.

"To young Nigerian journalists, what you need to know about int’l fellowship awards",https://punocracy.com/to-the-young-nigerian-journalists-what-you-need-to-know-about-intl-fellowship-awards/,2023-08-05T09:05:56+01:00,"By:Jairus Awo
Ah, the life of an ambitious, wide-eyed journalist ready to take on the world? Sounds like you? Read on.
There is nothing more exhilarating than pitching for international opportunities, right? Well, hold on to your press passes and grab a pen because I’m about to lay out the hurdles that’ll make you question everything you thought you knew about the glamorous wanderlust-filled life of a reporter.
First and foremost, let’s talk about the fantasy of picturesque train journeys. No, forgive my manners. You need to start securing quality pictures right from the flight.
And yea, you are not proud, so don’t post a full picture of yourself on the net; your village people might be watching. Not that they can do anything at this time, you have flown and as a Nigerian, that is beyond the witches’ pay grade. Just a snippet of the cloud with the wing of an airplane is enough. Make sure you book the window seat so you can capture the clouds. Your WhatsApp status craves for that update: “Alhamdulilahi”, “Jesus is taking care of me”.
Hey, you have to keep this ecstasy in mind while pitching. Like, even if your story or project description isn’t focused or fine-tuned, the fellowship application review officers need to know that your life as a journalist is going to blow and your pictures with some white folks, in a roundtable discussion, probably with a long body sweater, matters a lot.
Do I need to mention that you need an iPhone? It does not have to be an iPhone 100. What you need in there isn’t the capacity to capture the world but your tea breaks, lunch, and probably the hotel interior. Stand beside that long mirror pinned to your wardrobe and take a good picture of yourself. Don’t disappoint your village people, please.
It can be iPhone anything. Make sure it has a portrait mode that can radiate the light on you while defocusing every other thing around you. In case you don’t have one, well, there is a way around it. You can always network and make friends. They will snap you. But don’t bring out your phone should they ask you whether to Airdrop it for you. Quickly hurry out and tell them you will get the pictures on WhatsApp.
By all means, ensure you keep the Nigerian version of yourself intact.
You might even imagine yourself aboard an elegant locomotive, clicking away on your laptop as the scenic countryside gracefully unfolds outside your window. I mean the dear five-star hotel room that you never ever need to clean or arrange yourself. But alas, reality strikes with a vengeance. We will talk about reality later.
Let me paint a picture for you: You see all of the soothing clickety-clack, a symphony of baby cries, snoring passengers, and a constant reminder of your regrettable decision to grab a rickety cab with other frustrated Nigerians while trying to beat the traffic as a reporter in Nigeria? The gorgeous landscapes that are often replaced with grimy windows that showcase nothing but a blur of graffiti and questionable street food vendors?
You’ll even be lucky most times if you can get a single usable picture amidst the chaos.
It is well with you. But life abroad as a journalist must be fascinating; sip a coffee, press a laptop, look through the window to see a beautiful city.
So keep all that in your mind when pitching for international fellowships. If not for anything, your social media life matters. Forget humility; you are a big industry man.
Let’s talk about pitching.
When pitching internationally, there’s nothing that can go wrong with your tech aid, right? Your meticulously prepared PowerPoint presentations will work just fine while projecting your plans to a mesmerised audience. Wrong.
Sometimes you must prepare to face the wrath of technical demons. Your laptop battery will die at the most crucial moment, and when you finally manage to revive it, the Zoom (or whatever) link will decide to engage in a wild dance of colours, making your seemingly professional presentation resemble a surrealist art exhibit.
And don’t even get me started on the classic “slides not found” error message that always seems to appear at the least opportune times.
Have this in mind during the interview: The glamorous life of mingling with fellow journalists and industry professionals at international events. You might envision rubbing shoulders with the crème de la crème of the media world, exchanging witty banter over champagne and canapés (only if you know about brands, though).
But dear journalists, I hate to break it to you: you will spend 90 per cent of your time stuck in awkward conversations with people who are just as lost and desperate for a story as you are.
The remaining 10 per cent will be divided between hurriedly gulping down a glass of lukewarm tap water and desperately searching for a power outlet to charge your perpetually dying phone. (Be like me, have a power bank that can last the test time).
And as for that irresistible allure of securing exclusive interviews with global powerhouses? Brace yourself. You might envision riveting conversations with charismatic world leaders, but in reality, you’re more likely to engage in exasperating battles with overprotective press secretaries armed with rehearsed lines of denial.
It’s like playing a never-ending game of cat and mouse, only this time, the mouse is wielding a PR strategy. At the end of the day, you’ll realise that your desperately sought-after interview is nothing more than a painfully shallow soundbite, and the satisfaction is fleeting at best.
So I came bearing this exciting news today as an early career journalist. You need to be international to be “relevant” in this industry. We might even call you to conferences and TV shows to speak about your experience and how you managed to get a picture dump featuring Donald Trump.
So, my aspiring journalist friends, while the allure of international opportunities may initially hypnotise you with its fairytale-like charm, remember that the reality is often tinged with chaos, technical headaches, and disappointingly shallow encounters. But fear not, for through these hurdles, you’ll find the true essence of journalism — the indomitable spirit to persevere, adapt, and transform even the most mundane moments into stories worth telling.
Keep a sense of humour, and you’ll survive anything that the world of journalism throws at you. Good luck out there, my intrepid reporters!

Country that cannot save its people plans to rescue people who don’t want to be saved,https://punocracy.com/country-that-cannot-save-its-people-plans-to-rescue-people-who-dont-want-to-be-saved/,2023-08-05T08:23:22+01:00,"The government of Naijiriya, a country lodged in the armpit of Africa, has perfected plans to rescue people living in Nijey, a neighbouring country to the north. There’s only one problem: those people do not want to be saved.
Thousands of people have trooped to the street to protest Naijiriya’s proposal, going as far as calling Naijiriyan president Baller Tininbu, Ebola, one of the deadliest infections to have reared its head on the continent.
If you remember, in July, people in the Nijeyrian Army who were appointed to guard President Mohammed Zoomba got fed up and locked him up instead, hoping to get him to resign. Recently, soldiers in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Guinea also kicked out the democrats in government, who have chosen to be kissing the boots of Western countries instead of their own boots.
The regional bloc, CEDEAO, is afraid the dark days of military rule from the 1960s will return, where soldiers would seize their source of income and refuse to let go after realising how profitable and intoxicating power can be in Africa. But Nijeyrians do not mind having khaki-wearing commandos formulate and implement policies. After all, they have had several decades of democracy but are still one of the world’s poorest countries — taking some of the stench away from Naijiriya.
“We are happy to be ruled by soldiers who have no regard for human rights,” said Moukaïla Bazouka, one of the protesters holding a placard that reads ‘Say No To Ebola Tininbu’.
“We are happy to cut ties with everyone, including France, which has supported us against terror groups, and Naijiriya, which supplies us with electricity. Only Russia understands us, so we are eloping with them. We will give them all our uranium and then become a member of BRICS and be as rich as South Africa.”
But Baller Tininbu, who just last month was elected chairman of CEDEAO, has turned a deaf ear to the insults and protests. “Let the people of Nijey breathe!” he declared at the press conference on Friday. “We owe them that responsibility and we will rescue them whether they like it or not.”
Tininbu has given the coup leaders in Nijey one week to vacate the throne and threatened fire and brimstone if they fail to comply. That ultimatum will expire soon and Naijiriyans are anxious.
Naijiriya has not really been a bastion of democracy and good governance either, with many people alleging that the election that skateboarded Tininbu into the state house was heavily rigged.
During the administration of former President Modu Bukhari, objects were refusing to fly, including things whose only mission is to take flight, such as pigeons and a national airline. But under the few months of Tininbu’s leadership, things have gotten so bad that objects are falling from the sky, including elevators and airplanes. Meanwhile, food and fuel prices have bought a permanent residence in the heavens.
The country is also notorious for being so insecure that it has exported some of its violence to the neighbouring countries of Nijey and Kamerun.
“If all our soldiers are sent to fight a war in Nijey, who will remain to protect us from Boko Haram, bandits, and separatist madmen?” asked Ejike Adamu, a human rights advocate and social commentator.
“Let us reason this thing well o. Not all of us have other countries we can run to when crisis breaks out. Don’t we already have enough things to worry about?”"
"Alert! GWR, Nigerians are plotting to fill up your book of records.",https://punocracy.com/alert-gwr-nigerians-are-plotting-to-fill-up-your-record/,2023-07-08T11:38:34+01:00,"By:Quadri Yahya
Hello, verifiers at the Guinness Book of Records.
I write to alert you of an attempt by industrious and trailblazing citizens of my country who are extremely eager to fill the pages of your remarkable global record.
Nigerians have launchedOperation Fill the Book of Recordsto make sure all the blank pages are flooded with their names even if their-a-thonis nonsensical. Not that my people have bad intentions, though. But they are just covetous folks who leavetètèto killlapalapa.
The fact that you would need a translator to understand the above co-mixed Yoruba proverb means there is no better person to explain the nature of Nigerians to you than a Nigerian.
My people are pacesetters both locally and internationally. They are ubiquitous. They have their footprints in science and technology, economy, and literature. They have residences and stores on Mars and Jupiter.
But the new-age Nigerians seek to etch their names on your record, which would soon be filled up anyway.
Recently, one of us opened the door to your old book by cooking nonstop for four days. Then, a coup to dominate your records was plotted and launched.
Even our prominent president reportedly set the pace in sign-a-thon. Apparently, to prove a point, Mr President hit the ground running by signing four bills in two weeks! The president deserves an accolade and a certificate of excellence as, perhaps, the first number one citizen to achieve this feat. Though a critic ridiculed the achievement by saying the bills arelow-hanging fruits, I think it is deserving of a medal from no less than the GWR headquarters.
To whom much is given, GWR Verifiers, much is as well expected. Give the damn award to my President!
I also learnt that a prayer warrior desires to embark on a vain prayer session — so his/her name would feature in your records. Glory to God.
That is the spirit in us. The spirit of competitiveness. The showy spirit. The spirit of setting a pace and then abusing it.
But GWR, let prominence paint the pages of your book, henceforth.
Give pre-kudos to Nigerian writers who want to contribute to literacy by writing relentlessly for days. One of them categorically said he would end the drill on a Friday to allow him to go for the Muslim jum’at prayer.
Another, an admirable female, said her energy would be exerted into writing children’s books.
We need more of them!
I am curious, though, to know what contribution the drill by a chef and a prayerful person to the GWR has to society beyond ostentatiously forcing their names into the record.
On the other hand, the world needs writers because they can shape our perspectives about ourselves and the environment. Prominence should be given to everything! While food is delicious, books are more delicious. While cooking could be a passion, the basic fact remains that the world needs writers more than chefs.
Mykontiripeople, too, should make noise for feats by idiosyncratic record holders such as a Nigerian artist who, in a bid to create a platform to help young artists explore their creativities, organised the longest recording marathon event on 25 June 2022. But no; for such a feat, the fanfare fades before it shines.
As a concerned Nigerian, I write to alert verifiers at GWR of an attempt by industrious and trailblazing citizens of my country who are extremely eager to fill the pages of your remarkable global record.
And I leave you to decide whether to allow the GWR book to be abused and make it infamous for frivolity.
Signed:
Current record holder for the longest alert-a-thon.

The unbelievable tangle of truth: A satirical take on JAMB vs Mmesoma,https://punocracy.com/the-unbelievable-tangle-of-truth-a-satirical-take-on-jamb-vs-mmesoma/,2023-07-08T10:41:30+01:00,"By:Jairus Awo
In a world filled with astounding tales of brilliance and absurdity, leave it to our beloved Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to come up with yet another mind-boggling debacle.
Brace yourselves, dear readers, for we are about to embark on a journey into the heart of an institution so notorious and farcical it would make even the most imaginative of fiction writers blush with envy.
Picture this: an institution responsible for conducting admission exams—a gateway to higher education for eager young minds—gripped by a scandal that has drained it of every ounce of public trust it once held.
Enter a 19-year-old aspiring student, accused of forging her own scores—a crime so audacious, it could make an airport thriller novelist blush.
Our delightful JAMB, not one to shy away from eccentricity, claims that it has uncovered this student’s deceptive act.
It gleefully proclaims, “Behold, dear citizens! We have caught the mastermind behind the forged 362 scores!” But wait dear readers, the plot thickens.
While JAMB vilifies our poor teenage protagonist, accusing her of parading falsified results, the girl herself presents a mysterious and intriguing piece of evidence—an alleged result format sent down from the heavens of academic bureaucracy.
Ah, well, who are we to argue with the celestial powers of bureaucracy? It’s almost as if Apollo himself took a break from the pantheon to sign those documents digitally.
Now, let us pause for a moment and reflect on the institution’s colourful history.
Remember the time they claimed a snake casually slithered into their offices and devoured a hefty sum of ₦‎36 million?
Oh, the audacity!
One can’t help but wonder: did the serpent have a penchant for intricate paperwork too? Did it gnaw away at precious results, only to regurgitate them later in a gloriously twisted fashion?
Dear readers, our imaginations run wild.
As we explore the ins and outs of this tale, it becomes apparent that the institution itself seems to have a delightful flair for theatre.
Picture this: a grand stage, adorned with gaudy drapes, as bored government officials shuffle around mumbling incomprehensible jargon.
Oh, the drama! The intrigue! It’s Oscar-worthy, I tell you.
But fear not, dear citizens, for amidst the chaos, satire comes to our rescue.
With our tongues firmly in our cheeks, let us relish in the irony of an institution, plagued with so many incredulous tales, accusing a student of deception.
It’s like a pot calling a kettle black, or a tax collector accusing someone of greed—it tickles the funny bone, indeed.
While we chuckle at this carnival of absurdity, let us not forget the essence of this tale: a systemic failure, a loss of public trust, and the unfortunate repercussions faced by a young soul caught in its web.
It’s a scathing critique of an institution entrusted with shaping the future, while it tramples upon the dreams of those it is meant to uplift.
So, dear readers, as we put our pens down and bid adieu to this satirical journey, let us not merely laugh, but reflect.
The untrustworthy institution of #JAMB is not merely a punchline—it is a call for reform.
For in a world where snakes swallow millions and bureaucratic enigmas masquerade as results, we must demand transparency, accountability, and a dash of common sense.
And remember, dear citizens, as we navigate these tumultuous waters of education, sometimes satire is our most powerful weapon against the follies of the absurd.
So, let us wield it with grace, wit, and an unwavering dedication to truth and justice—without letting the snakes slither away with our faith."
"The poor can breathe, but they still have to pay for the air, BAT clarifies",https://punocracy.com/the-poor-can-breathe-but-they-still-have-to-pay-for-the-air-bat-clarifies/,2023-06-17T10:55:22+01:00,"Nigeria’s tear-rubber president, Baller Ahmeth Tininbu, known fondly as BAT, says he stands by his statement regarding the right of poor people to inhale oxygen into their lungs, but now adds that this should not be misinterpreted to mean the air would be subsidised.
After former president Sai Baba took him on a tour of the state house on May 27, Tininbu famously asked people restricting the airflow of poor people to desist from this.
“We have to change our mindset, kill corruption in our society,” hetoldjournalists. “Let be poor breathe [sic]; don’t suffocate them. We have that responsibility.”
He, however, clarified in a statement released on Friday to select press outfits, including The T.A. Report, that while the poor are free to respirate whenever they want, it is not the government’s job to deliver oxygen to their doorsteps for free.
“What we are doing is to create an enabling environment for everyone, regardless of social class, to breathe. We will bring in investors from China and India to assemble premium-quality air in Nigeria and sell at globally competitive rates determined by market forces,” he said.
“This will create at least 100,000 direct jobs in my first 100 days in office. We will apply the same strategy to electricity, petroleum, healthcare, education, and even politics. The era of subsidy is gone.”
Tininbu added that the government has no plans to criminalise breathing as long as people don’t go sniffing around in places they are not welcome — like his underground pills empire.
“I’m sure people will wonder how the poor can afford to breathe if they cannot afford the air. The answer is simple: single-digit interest loans. We will introduce financial schemes where people can apply for oxygen on credit. With this oxygen, they can then continue to live and earn money, with which they will pay back the loan in the future. Anyone can get these benefits as long as they have real estate collateral, guarantors who are senior-level public servants, health insurance, and citizenship in any of the G20 countries.”
Those who are unable to pay back, he explained, would have to be conscripted into the Army.
Meanwhile, the T.A. Report gathered that armchair billionaire Aliko Dan Quixote has perfected plans to get a sole licence for the import and manufacture of oxygen. “He already has the buy-in of the national assembly and ministry of finance,” one unquestionable source informed us.
Caveat:Note that this piece is a fictional satire aimed purely at humour. The words above are nothing but products of a drunk writer’s imagination. We hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the results of anyone’s credulity or mischief. Do not take us seriously."
"Understanding the fuckening, and how to survive in four easy steps",https://punocracy.com/understanding-the-fuckening-and-how-to-survive-in-four-easy-steps/,2023-06-17T10:36:44+01:00,"By:Edwin Mamman
In this country, you are never short of bad days. Live here long enough and you’ll realise that you don’t even have to do anything to catch a bad day. It will fall on you like the Money and Banana that Davido promised Chioma. Take it from someone who’s had an immeasurable number of bad days. I’ve seen enough to write a book on it. But what we’re not going to do is sit and mope over bad days, no. We don pass that. What I will be showing you is how to survive one or a couple of bad days.
The fuckeningis an event or a series of events that happens to you and leaves you thinking, “What the fuck!?” You must understand thatthe fuckeningisquite distinct fromshege. Shege is universal in this country, butthe fuckeningis a special type ofshegethat happens every now and then. Think of it as an experience inside an experience, like raisins randomly sprinkled inside a cake. Ifshegeis having a flat tire with only 2k in your bank account,the fuckeningis your ATM card reading insufficient funds at the POS after your colleague has assured you that they’ve transferred 30k into your account. Kini fokii!
Now that you know whatthe fuckeningis, let’s get to the crux of this Ted talk, how to survive one:
The first step to survivingthe fuckeningis to recognise that you’re experiencing one. Otherwise, it’s going to hit you like a wrecking ball, and your day or week is going to play out like Nkiru Silvanus in ‘A Cry For Help’ (great movie, by the way), and you’re going to end up totally clueless in a sad corner of your room wondering who you offended or which of your village people are ‘working overtime on top your matter’ as you listen to Ajebo Hustlers’ ‘You Go Know’ (you’re going to listen to it at some point anyways). It’s not your village people, it’s just one of those days.
The second and most crucial step to survivingthe fuckeningis to take a step back. Yes, at this point, you’ve recognised that you’re having one of those ‘Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day’. Now you have to do the needful, which is nothing! Sometimes it helps to just get out of the way of things. Simply take a step back and observe the situation as it unfolds. Sometimes (and in this situation), trying to fix something only makes it worse. So don’t go trying to be Mr. Fixer, not this time oga. Save your energy for the everlastingshegethat abounds in this country.
Third step, disappear. At this point, you’re probably thinking, “Shey you dey whine me ni?” No. I mean it. There’s no perfect tranquilliser forthe fuckeninglike physically or mentally dissociating from it. Trust me, your mental health and peace of mind will thank you.
This is how to do it: if your job allows it, take the day off. You’re in school? Ditch that one class; it won’t hurt your GPA. Have kids? Drop them off at iya’s place and disappear. Trust me, you’re not being irresponsible. Can’t do any of that? Good news; you can still be at the crime scene and mentally dissociate. Just disappear in your mind. Relax and blast some depressing music or songs that reflect the deplorable state of the country.
Here’s a starter pack: Begin with M.I Abaga’s ‘Money’, then Libianca’s ‘People’. Follow it up with Yemi Alade’s ‘Criminal In Agbada’. Remember that Ajebo Hustlers song from earlier? Throw it in the mix. Throw in African China’s ‘Our Government Bad’ for a touch of old school. But hey, you can’t be sad or depressed all the way, it defeats the aim of my Ted talk. So finish with a happy tune like Asake’s ‘Terminator’, and maybe throw in ‘Dull’ for some motivation. You’d be surprised just how therapeutic music is.
In the event that you cannot disappear, rant about it! Call your mother, call your father, call your baby mama or daddy, your friends; hell, do a conference call and rant about your life. Tell a co-worker or any random stranger with nothing to do. After all, a problem shared is half solved. Or better still, go somewhere isolated and scream at the top of your lungs. (Annalise Keating and her students did it, trust me, it’s therapeutic.) Then resume your day like nothing is happening. Remember step two, don’t try to fix or micromanage anything. Just go about your business as best as you can. Believe me; I be OG for this matter.
Finally, practise gratitude. Understand that this day or week is just one of those little annoyances that life throws at you to test your patience, and most importantly, people are going through it every day in this country, no be only you. Things could be worse, much worse, but e no go spoil for you by God’s grace. When you get home, wash off the day in a bath, eat a rich meal, turn off the lights and call it a day, bearing in mind that bad days don’t last forever.
Do this, and I promise you will live a long life (given the circumstances)."
"Okada riders do have more than one life, new study reveals",https://punocracy.com/okada-riders-do-have-more-than-one-life-new-study-reveals/,2023-06-10T10:15:11+01:00,"Commercial motorcyclists are notorious for driving without regard for their life. Well, it is because they have so many they can afford to be reckless, a new study now tells us.
“It is a mystery that has dumbfounded researchers for decades. But we finally confirmed what a lot of people have been suspecting,” said Dr Balls Haliru, who led the multidisciplinary research team at the University of Bustin.
“What we discovered is that every okada [bike taxi] comes with pre-installed backup lives. This is what gives the riders confidence to compete with trucks on highways, drive against traffic, hit the roads without helmets, drive with both legs in the air, or even conduct routine maintenance of their bikes while in motion.
“It is no coincidence that the word okada has itsoriginsin Edo state, south-south Nigeria. We all know what that place is famous for.”
The only downside, Dr Haliru clarified, is that the mysterious life insurance only covers the rider and not their passenger. “Also, no one knows for certain how many lifelines each person is entitled to.”
Scientists are still trying to find out if they can harness this discovery to give other professionals immunity from work hazards.
When The T.A. Report contacted Nigeria’s Ministry of Transportation for comments, they replied that they had known this for a long time.
“If you hear that any okada rider dies in a road accident, it is because the person has used up all their allotted lives. It wasn’t their first death on the job.”
The spokesperson explained that this is why the government has been lax in regulating the sector. The okada-riding business is one of the easiest to get into in the country. You do not need a licence. You do need to wear safety kits. You do not even need to be an adult. According to data from the Global Bank, at least 20 per cent of okada riders in Nigeria are underage.
“I used to think that people who were suicidal just used to get okadas and ride carelessly so that they could feel something,” Wabi Lasayi, a poor Nigerian who cannot afford e-hailing services, told us. “But now I know better.”"

“I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody” – PMB.
After a spine-tingling speech by the immediate ex-President of Nigeria which did not only rejuvenate hope in the minds of Nigerians but spurred everyone into being hardworking, I had made up my mind to support him and his agenda, whether blindly or with two eyes open.
As emotional as this work may seem, I tearfully write this in honour and memory of our hero – the father of modern African democracy – as he makes way for the next saviour of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. With utmost certainty, I begin by saying that not only will Nigerians miss him for his exquisite knowledge of governance and leadership, but Africa as a whole will. As with all Nigerians, I have witnessed how Buhari offered himself a redemption tool for the forgone and lost democracy of the country. Hence, hischangemantra. His emergence as the President was the best thing that ever happened to us.
All those political and economic analysts who say his regime was the worst since our return to democracy deserve to be detained for spewing such blatant lies. It’s witchcraft of the highest level to demean such a corrupt-free regime.
As the curtain draws on the exceptional eight years of his administration, I write to bid him a loud farewell from Aso Rock to Daura, though I wish he could linger around so he could always advise the new President on choices to make when faced with crucial issues like the events at Lekki Tollgate.
It was truly the kind of administration we envisaged when he was handed power, and we all praised him for giving Nigerians a life worth living. I know how jealous American and European countries and other underdeveloped nations were simply because you were named the best black President in the world due to your relentless effort in developing a country that saw no light for so many years. They never thought Nigeria under Buhari could outpace them in terms of economic development, technology, and security. One would wonder why these countries often denied Nigerians entry or even deported our countrymen. It can only be envy. They felt we bragged too much about Buhari and even tried to spoil our exchange rates by devaluing our highly esteemed naira. The good news is we conquered! Shame unto them.
I rejoice with the (suspended) CBN Governor for a job well done, especially the recent naira redesign, which made it the finest currency of the 21st century. We felt so new. His level of ingenuity in the financial institution was second to none. This currency was made in surplus that no Nigerian could complain of lack of money. Some commercial banks had so much cash stock they began complaining of space for storage.
We have seen Nigeria take a leap with his tenacity, diligence, and leadership dexterity. Nigeria is no more where it used to be. We have grown. We have seen tremendous achievements that have pushed the economy of the country to its peak.
His inaugural speech and his performance show that there are genuine and good-hearted politicians who still have their citizens at heart despite what people say of them.
According to him, “The fundamental issue facing this country is insecurity and the problem of economy which was being made worse by corruption. I assure you that we are going to finally assemble a competent team of Nigerians to efficiently manage the country”.
We saw his performance match these reassuring words. We heard of peace and security and how they reigned in places like Zamfara, Maiduguri, Nasarawa, Jos, Taraba, Bauchi, to mention but a few.
A competent team of Nigerians were truly assembled to manage the country. I applaud them with all my heart. Those who pretend not to have seen this are what we call in pidgin ‘bad belle’. The guarantee of security in Nigeria became so high to the extent that the commander-in-chief of the armed forces mobilised trucks of warlords to rescue a dying Ukraine from the hands of its oppressors. A usual and common act he’s done for Afghanistan, Iraq, and other states facing conflict. He was so good at playing the biblical David’s role.
The issue of bandits and all other assortments of criminals (armed and unarmed) wreaking havoc, especially in northern areas, are now things of the past. It may have looked like he kept silent over the killings of non-Fulanis by pastoralists. It may have also looked like he was nepotistic with his appointments. These things only looked like. There are differences between looking like and being. Even if these were true, so what? Does charity not begin from home?
During the days of Buhari, which we miss so much, employment opportunities were boosted drastically. No Nigerian graduate ever complained of unemployment. It got to a point where the Nigerian Government began to invite unemployed foreigners for job interviews. Those who met the requirements were given jobs in their respective fields, while those who never met were asked to wait in their respective countries for the next recruitment. The government also started announcing the appointment of dead people because the living were already gainfully employed.
When the immediate ex-President called the Nigerian youth lazy, people thought he really meant it. No, it was far from that. According to his apology that was circulated everywhere, he clarified that he was referring to the very few blacks abroad who resembled Nigerians. It was all a mistake of colour and identity. It was later confirmed that most of those people spotted on television and in papers in America were Zambians, Liberians, and Togolese. No sane Nigerian would leave Nigeria to find greener pastures elsewhere.
As churches were busy performing miracles, the Federal Government kept up the pace by narrating amazing stories of wonders. Under Buhari’s regime, we heard about a snake swallowing thirty-six million naira. We heard how monkeys carted away millions of naira. But what if the snake had swallowed the woman in the custody of the cash? Would Buhari not be blamed for not being able to protect her? Praise God she was safe. Those who say she should have been probed are evil. Do they think the story was framed to deceive Nigerians? Even if it was, and so? It only shows how creative Nigerians became under his administration.
Buhari became a walking world power. He personally toured UK’s health facilities to ensure they weren’t below the standard he established in Nigeria. This is why he sent Nigerian doctors abroad at some point to teach foreigners how to carry out the profession effectively. People who thought Nigerian doctors travelled abroad because the Federal Government was not taking care of them are wicked. They are the real enemies of Nigeria. As for education, nine out of every ten Professors are singing his praises for tremendously revamping everything about education. Some say they only went on strike because they felt they needed rest. Others say they have told the Federal Government to cut their salaries because of how big it is. One lecturer cannot be earning millions like holy and hardworking Nigerian Politicians. They say they have appealed on several occasions for pay cuts.
In conclusion, as a wanna-leave citizen of Nigeria, I would rate his governing skillset 97%. The previous administrations are the reasons he never got the 100%. The ills of those regimes made him fall short. He would be rigged in again if there were a chance for a third term. Sorry, I meant he would be voted into office again. This was an era when hunger, bombings, mass burials, banditry, corruption, unlawful detentions, outrageous inflation, and insecurity ended.
Until he vacated the office, we saw a passionate, zealous man with an undiminished enthusiasm to serve Nigeria. Now I see why people all over the social media space are crying, “We shall miss Buhari; he was like a father to us.”

"Nigeria’s Fmr Aviation Minister Was Also A Magician, Leaked Documents Show",https://punocracy.com/nigerias-former-aviation-minister-was-also-a-magician-leaked-documents-show/,2023-06-03T08:20:08+01:00,"Former Nigerian aviation minister, Haddi Sirikka, is not a novice to disappearing acts, which — if you think about it — explains his remarkable trick with the Nigeria Air project.
Information shared with this paper revealed that, aside from his background in aviation and serial politicking, Sirikka devoted much of his time to mastering the secrets of magic, which may have given him an edge during the ministerial screening.
The T.A. Report saw a video of him pulling objects out of a top hat in what appears to be a magic show in the United States, where he studied flight safety and aeronautics.
We also obtained documents from his application to the ministerial position in 2015 that confirmed this.
“I believe my skills with the sleight of hand will come in handy if I am granted this opportunity,” he wrote in a cover letter addressed to the Nigerian Senate.
“I understand that a position this important will require being able to make the impossible happen, making huge objects appear from thin air and making them disappear into thin air. I am not a novice when it comes to White Elephant projects. I worked closely with elephants at the Big Apple Circus in New York before I returned to serve my country.”
He mentioned that, in fact, his favourite movie wasNow You See Me, and his favourite television show wasThe Carbonaro Effect.
Sirikka has since been accused ofspendingN85.4 billion on an elusive national carrier he called Nigeria Air. He firstunveiledthe project in 2018 at an air show in London, promising that the skies would be full of Nigeria’s commercial planes by the end of the year. When the ovation faded out, though, all that was left was silence, dust, and a nice expensive logo — designed by some folks in Bahrain.
Sirikka executed his final grand performance in office days before the handover to a new government. He exhibited a magnificent Boeing 737 plane painted in Nigeria’s green and white colours as journalists and stakeholders applauded his genius.
“When we came in 2015, we knew what to do,” heboasted. He promised that this was just one plane of many to come. “Operation of local and international flights will commence soon. Before the end of this administration, before May 29, we will fly.”
The plane has indeedtaken flight— back to its original mandate of making money for Ethiopian Airlines by conveying people between Addis Ababa and Mogadishu.
A close associate of the former minister, who asked not to be named for fear of being disappeared by DSS agents, said he’s never trusted the man.
“I am surprised people did not know about this. The wordHaddiwas obviously coined fromHarry Houdini, name of the famous American escape artiste and stunt performer.Sirikka, on the other hand, was derived from the Arabicsihr, which means magic. The signs have been there all along,” the source said.
“So it is either he comes from a long line of illusionists, or that is not even his real name. It could just be a stage name for this massive heist, and we have all been conned.”
“Now for my final escape trick. I call it The Getting Away With Fraud.”"
"​​On your mandate, we shall queue!",https://punocracy.com/on-your-mandate-we-shall-queue/,2023-06-03T08:10:12+01:00,"Newly crowned Nigerian King, Bulaba Balablue, started his administration on a powerful note by declaring an end to fuel subsidy, a malaise that had hitherto kept Nigerians from unleashing their full potential and living their lives to the fullest.
Immediately after his announcement, ostentatious and luxury-loving Nigerians took to the streets in jubilation as they now had a King who hearkened to their voices. What Bubu could not do, under two seconds, Balablue had done. The people hailed him as Idan, because nothing dey wey Idan no fit do.
Petrol, which was drilled in their backyards, was now a premium product, another benchmark of wealth against which they could measure their flaccid members.
Members of Balablue’s inner caucus were most jubilant as a special petrol price was announced specifically for them.
In a press statement released in the aftermath of Balablue’s declaration, instead of the benchmarked price of N488 in Balablue’s home state, members of Balablue’s inner caucus could access the product at N164 if they had their membership cap on. If they added their polo or Ankara to the mix, they’d have the privilege of accessing it at N105. Members holding and waving their broom, the symbol of their ‘caucus-ship’, in addition to all of the above, would access the product at N65.
It was further rumoured that citizens who offered the secret emi l’okan salute or handshake at fuelling stations would be given agbado to step down their blood pressure whilst making their various purchases – a clear indication of Balablue’s love for his subjects.
In the midst of these jubilant exultations are the naysayers who have expressed intense displeasure with Balablue’s giant strides. These group of dissidents have been running their mouths on Obasanjo’s internet, telling all who will listen to their diatribe that they’d rather remain in the hold of Sapa, trekking to their destinations and harvesting the yams from their legs than partake in what they have began calling “Bulablue’s poisoned chalice.”
These dissident voices are, however, drowned out as the people in their ecstasy sing in praise and support of Balablue:
On your mandate, we shall queue x2
On your mandate… x2
On your mandate, we shall queue… (Till fade)"

“I have dreamt of this moment for a long time. To trend. A day when my little galloway will command lions, elephants, and ravenous tigers to pave the way,” M.D. fantasised the night before the controversial interview.
He had a date with his girlfriend, an agreed meet and greet with his historian-uncle, and a scheduled Twitter space where he could, as usual, postulate theories on how to make Nigeria great again. But he gave all of these a rain check. There is always a next time. He shouldn’t miss the golden chance of “going international”.
M.D. phoned his mum, a successful businesswoman in Gusau, and sent a text to his dad, informing them he was about to make them proud. “I am about to set a record so high our entire generation will set aside a day to mark it every year,” he bragged.
He did set a record.
Nigerians, of course, know the truth, but they are always looking for who will spill the beans. Because Ajibade was given the waiver to spend six months in Mama Charlie’s country home, he has imported his extended family and cleared them with his student visa.
Why will these people outnumber us? The English authorities are baffled, angry and dissatisfied. So, they have concluded that foreign postgraduate students on non-research courses will no longer be able to bring family members to the UK under new immigration regulations.
Would you blame them after they found out that migration into the land of cheese and sweets has hit a record 700,000 this year? So, if you want to study, be prepared to practise abstinence from your kinsmen.
Fellow Nigerians! They have stretched the opportunity to a slacking point. When one of them secures admission to study, they jump in with him as his books and stay glued to his back like life support.
The UK government needed someone to hit the nail on the head to scheme its narrative, its media was hungry for a scapegoat who would validate its evidence-based reporting, and poor stardom-starved M.D. fell victim.
Sorry, we are not sorry.
Niger area has been squeezed between the devil and the deep blue sea for a long time or, better put, crashed into the channel and its remains disappeared from radar. It has become a geographical entity full of people with big brains but small productive output. Its people are already being stigmatised, topping the chart in the country’s negative image super league.
From teacher to student, driver to passenger, seller and customer, everyone wants to ride on the ills instead of the wrong notions the country has bred. They want to weave out a superhero tale from a garden of destined failure and calculated misfortune.
So, when M.D. got his chance, he didn’t disappoint.
“Since you got here, haven’t you brought anyone into the UK as a dependant?” the interviewer asked.
“Eeeen eeerhmn,” M.D.’s voice trails off as he struggles to respond.
The euphoria of an international appearance has now become a national ignominy — with hate targeted both online and off the internet.
There’s an M.D. everywhere.
An overjoyous first-timer who just wants to enjoy the moment but unintentionally causes harm to his tribe. He speaks the truth even though it ruffles the feather of more than half of his countrymen.
But then, M.D. could also be an opportunist who had waited and waited for a chance to retaliate against the jabs he had received from Nigerians in the UK, therefore, deliberately throwing his people under the bus for cheap clout.
In any case, you must develop your home.
How many American, British, and French citizens want their families to come to Nigeria because they have long-term engagements there? Sportspersons, postgraduate students, and diplomats who are from developed countries even see themselves as hard labourers doing unsolicited extra work by leaving their comfort zone for a foreign land.
Their families pity them. They look after them and double-check to confirm they’ve not lost their senses before leaving home. But in Nigeria, everybody wants their people to migrate so that they can be smuggled in as dependents.

The story of Masaka’s two electricity supply lines,https://punocracy.com/the-story-of-masakas-two-electricity-supply-lines/,2023-05-13T14:55:54+01:00,"By:Solomon Hamza
Masaka, the place I live in, has two distinct power supply phases. It is surprising that a single town should have two phases of electricity, and for someone like you reading this, you would think this is a privilege. Masaka might just be the second-best place to reside in Nigeria after Aso Villa.
Don’t they say two heads are better than one? But I assure you, in the case of Masaka’s power supply, I will prefer a head as empty as a matchbox devoid of matchsticks to the so-called two heads leading us down a slope into total darkness. And we were told The Dark Ages ended centuries ago, for God’s sake.
The two power phases have distinct names, with each winning portions of houses in certain areas. You would think it was a political rivalry. In fact, the relationship they share amongst themselves is sort of a first-wife-second-wife competition. I will not talk about the side-chick, generator, because only people with shops and money to spare to purchase a litre of fuel for ₦300 own them.
The first one is called Phase Eleven. It has a nickname, Jeun Primary Line, because the majority of its users reside in Jeun Primary, but most people prefer the first name. I do not know why it is being called Phase Eleven. Even the old dwellers do not know. Phase Eleven is the oldest power supply and history has it that the first time the people in Masaka shouted ‘Up Nepa’ leaping to the air for joy, the Phase Eleven power supply was responsible. The origin of Line Eleven can be traced to Abuja, but most times, I sit and ask myself which part of Abuja. Isn’t that the federal capital city where the most underdeveloped slums are assumed to have a steady supply of electricity? Where, then, is the true origin of this Phase Eleven?
Phase Eleven is generous to a fault, like politicians during campaigns itchy for the people’s votes. The staff rarely harass or trouble its consumers for light bills and it is certain that there would be electricity during festive periods. Periodically, they supply‘apology light’,which is to say they leave the electricity on for hours and hours until we begin to grumble about their generosity, muttering statements like, “this one wey NEPA leave light so.” We usually enjoy this ‘apology light’ when they do not supply their regular electricity for days without good reason.
Phase Eleven is also a regular, six-hour electricity phase, and except the transformer explodes or there’s rainfall — either light or heavy or even the weather changes its colour from sky blue and white to black, grumbling with thunder and lashing with lightning — there would be electricity from 12 am to 6 am every day. Sometimes, when they feel light-headed or happy, there would be electricity in the afternoon.
Phase Eleven is the envy of the other electricity phase, even with its daily six-hour electricity supply. It has also attracted many secret admirers across the border.
The second power supply is called Phase Thirty-Three. It has the highest population of consumers. History has it that it used to be the better half of the people in Masaka — a replacement to their old, jealous, nagging Phase Eleven, which gives only six hours of electricity a day.
The inhabitants of Masaka witnessed a non-stop power supply during the first year of its arrival, so much that the consumers boasted about having more electricity than the president himself and this triggered more than 80 per cent of the dwellers to switch loyalty, running into the doting arms of Phase Thirty-Three.
The rivalry got worse because Phase Thirty-Three traces her origin from Keffi — a town located East of Masaka and they boasted that it was not only Abuja that had the best of things, electricity inclusive. A year passed and Phase Thirty-Three began to show its colours, from transformer explosion due to overloading to the sudden disappearance of wires and cables, and the arrogance of the staff. Not forgetting the sleep-over food that had gone sour and spoilt because there was no electricity to preserve them in fridges and freezers.
Worse is that even Phase Thirty-Three’s office in Masaka is rarely with electricity and its staff go on to switch on their generator during hot afternoons.
Phase Thirty-Three is a rapture-like power supply because nobody knows when, where, or how the electricity would come, but everybody is certain it will come. And when they supply electricity, they would leave it for two days at a stretch. It is usually for two days because the third day is Ladder Carrying or Billing Day. After that, there would be another phase of total darkness and rapture-like-anticipation that would stretch on for days or even weeks.
I do not know which is worse between these two phases; the consumers themselves are not in agreement. I also do not know when the power supply would be better, but like every Nigerian, I have hope. Probably both power phases would wake up from their slumber or maybe a third phase would arrive like a knight in shiny armour and rescue us from the shackles of epileptic power supply in Masaka. Till then.

"Governance in Nigeria is secretly a spiritual battle, but they won’t tell you",https://punocracy.com/governance-in-nigeria-is-secretly-a-spiritual-battle-but-they-wont-tell-you/,2023-05-06T08:57:16+01:00,"When Ajakaiye was finally announced as Nigeria’s president-elect of Nigeria, it was as if someone had mopped up what was left of his energy with a towel and had drained it inside a gutter. He’d spent all his savings on the campaign. He’d only gotten fourteen million, three hundred and thirty-two thousand, five hundred naira from the GoFundMe project, but that was gone within two days of lobbying and campaigning. He still has people he’s indebted to. It was his third time contesting, so he wasn’t caught unawares. He’d been shown the dark, hard dangers of the well, but he jumped anyway because he was thirsty.
No, he wasn’t thirsty for power. He was thirsty for reforms. For change. For a new dispensation away from corruption, underdevelopment, and insecurity. That is exactly how he put it in his inaugural speech.
But weeks into office, his demeanour changed. Having decades of experience politicking is certainly not the same as spending a day in the driver’s seat of power. Why did nobody tell him?
Why did no one mention the snakes and monkeys? Those who do not hunger for bananas and rats but mint cash. And not just any lying around; they have developed a powerful skillset to open locks and devour mounds of money thought to be safely kept.
Why did no one tell him about the sham in Nigeria’s health sector? That mechanics and plumbers were getting robed into scrubs and treating people because all the qualified medics had gone to Canada and Saudi Arabia? No wonder his predecessors did not trust the local healthcare system and always had to go to Germany or the United Kingdom for minor injuries.
Why did no one inform him of the billions the government was getting from terrorists, bandits, and kidnappers in the form of taxes? That over half of the country’s internally generated revenue actually comes from organised crime. And that if all the criminals go to jail, it’ll spell doom for the economy. Why did no one talk about the otherworldly stock market, where Nigerian lives are worth less than a shitcoin and that it’s actually okay for thousands of people to die every year. Really, it doesn’t upset the universe.
Why did no one talk about the supreme rule about budgeting for education? That it must never surpass eight per cent of the total capital budget; otherwise, the country crumbles. Nigerians are already getting the best quality of education they are entitled to, according to theBig Book of ‘If You Know What is Good for You’. Anything more than this will lead to pure chaos.
Why did no one mention the god of commissions? That just like Yahoo boys sometimes need to spend money on silly things for their fortunes to continue to shine, politicians must commission stupid projects every year if they want to cling to power. They know the projects are ridiculous, but it is what the god of commissions demands.
Why did no one ever call him to a corner to intimate him about the witches and wizards of Aso Villa? About how they keep the occupant of the presidential seat young and healthy and delay their death by a decade or two, but the occupant must also sacrifice his sanity and agility. It’s simple. You get the immortality potion but also a harmless little bit of schizophrenia.
Nigerian politics, he would learn far too late, requires the strength of men and the wisdom of the senile. It is no place for women and youth or people with disabilities, and this has nothing to do with discrimination. It is just one of those secrets that keep the country from falling apart, descending into a civil war, or crumbling under powerful natural disasters. It is why ‘God’ has continued to bless the country with riches that are out of reach and gifted its people with tongues that may run out of food and water but never out of prayer points.
The other day, Ajakaiye learnt that the spiritual realm also had a vested interest in Bandana’s politics. The association of traditional worshippers had paid him a visit and carefully explained the reverse relationship between economic development and interests in religion, especially voodoo and traditional workshop. The more people you lift out of poverty, the more people forget their roots and gods. People are no longer trooping out to see masquerades as they used to, and the population of white tourists has reduced too, due to insecurity. And so the gods had mandated that year-on-year economic growth must not be more than 2 per cent. And the literacy rate, too, must never surpass 60 per cent. If the gods themselves had not sent him press statements in his dream, he might not have believed it.
Ajakaiye has always thought governance couldn’t be rocket science. Even if it were, with his three MScs and two PhDs, he was going to make it look like a stroll in a park. But now he realises it isn’t. It’s something way worse. It’s spiritual warfare. And he didn’t come prepared for that."
5 guys you should never fall for as a smart Nigerian university chic,https://punocracy.com/5-guys-you-should-never-fall-for-as-a-smart-nigerian-university-chic/,2023-05-06T08:48:42+01:00,"By:Esther Omoye
“So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.”
We all know that the university is the “happening place” for most of us. Many of us see the university as a place of liberation, where we can freely express ourselves, experience love and heartbreak, and align with different values. As a Nigerian Federal University student, however, it’s important to know the types of guys you should avoid.
These may not be the warnings you received from home or in your prayers, and they may only become apparent once you’re on campus. But as a sister to other sisters, I am here, standing hands akimbo, to do well with my duties:
There’s a Yoruba proverb that says:Bi won ba peeyan ni onifun rairai, ki onitoun na pa ifun e mo.If they call you a glutton, when you see food, control your appetite.
The Alajeuns are the type of guys that will never control their appetite when they see food. These ones? They want you for food and nothing else. They don’t want anything to do with you except you have a way or means to feed their stomach, and of course, when there’s no food? You’re of no use to them.
They’d follow you around, everywhere in school, and the only thing it comes down to is you being a sort of sous-chef for some boy that doesn’t care about your feelings but only how and when you can satisfy his stomach. I know right?
Is it not just food? Is there anything wrong with giving food to someone you like and care about? My dear sisi ekos, there’s nothing wrong o, ko si wahala kan kan. All I’m saying is that to an Alajeun, you aren’t just being nice and caring to the boy you like. You’re his meal ticket, he is very much aware of whatever games he is playing with you. He is only in contact because you are his food bank, your contact is probably saved as “Priscilla Bukka,” “Ada Food,”  “Zainab Canteen,” or maybe even “Olori Jeun Je Je.”
We all know who these ones are na. These are the type of guys that have girls orbiting around them 24/7 in the faculty. The ones the whole faculty revolves around. Their face is the first thing that flashes through your mind whenever you hear Falz singing:sweet boi azociation, na me be oga.
I understand that we can’t always control who we develop feelings for. However, it’s important to recognise that not everyone is worth pursuing. You may think he’s being nice to you, but in reality, he’s likely being nice to multiple other girls as well. He thrives on attention and has no intention of changing his behaviour for you. He’s only interested in casual flings, and that’s not going to change.
It’s best to avoid these types unless you’re just looking for a temporary thrill. However, keep in mind that rumours suggest the excitement is often short-lived and not worth the trouble.
Love is such a beautiful thing, and now think about spending the rest of your life with the love of your life. Probably some cut-outMawuli-Gavor-meet-Beverly-Naya-Netflix-moment. I can’t imagine the Dopamine rush too.
Sistas, these are the type of guys who will make grand promises of marriage but have no intention of following through. Despite your shared future plans, such as naming your first male child, Ayo, and your daughter, Chidinma, being added to the family group chat, and getting along well with his family, he has no plans of actually marrying you. You may even have a dream wedding gown in mind, your aso ebi train ready to slay like thePrincess of Africow,and a wedding theme song picked out — I’d go with an all-time favourite; Timi Dakolo’s Iyawo Mi.Iyawo wa, e da kun, I feel you too.
Remember the whole Mr A got committed to Miss B and said things like he wanted to get married to Miss C soon? Well, it’s with pleasure I introduce to you the pioneers of this movement. I refer to these guys as the “marriage hookers,” marriage is the bait, and you’re what needs to be caught hook, sink and line. Marriage is a beautiful thing but these ones? You’re just being held down with the idea of marriage. You’re the last person they’d even ever think about getting married to. Please, don’t let one broda pull you intoa see-me-see-trouble-broda-you-go-marry me-o-since-we-bin-dating-for-many-years-now-you-want-to-leave-me-follow-Shola situationship.
Plus, my guys call me Cristiano,
Mr. Ronaldo.Like Davido would rather say to us.
Yes, I know. This is not a football highlight, but let’s just assume it’s the VC cup, it’s your departmental cup, your faculty cup, and you’re the starting midfielder from SOSA, but there’s another sista from the Medical Sciences who’s playing for the second half, and one other from Physics who’s the highest goal scorer in the league but soon to be topped by the director of sports in your faculty.
Yes, in today’s dating world, there are many new terms and behaviours that have emerged. One of the more recent phenomena is the practice of “benching” someone, particularly in the case of guys benching girls. Essentially, this means keeping someone on the sidelines, not fully committing to them, and yet not completely letting them go either. It’s a confusing and frustrating situation for the person being benched, and it’s important to understand why it happens and how to deal with it.
First and foremost, guys bench girls because they want to keep their options open. They may not be ready for a committed relationship, or they may be interested in pursuing other people at the same time. Benching someone allows them to have the best of both worlds – they can continue to see other people while also keeping you around as a backup option. Additionally, some guys may enjoy the attention and validation they receive from having someone interested in them, even if they don’t reciprocate those feelings.
Move on, sistas! If he’s not ready to define things, don’t play for his team. Be a free agent, play the field. It’s open season!
Bad girl say she wan Netflix and chill
So I ja ticket give am warning
If you fall in love, clearly certain
You go chop breakfast, I’m notcapping
Thank you, Pheelz for preaching the gospel like no one has ever before!
In recent years, the phrase “Netflix and chill” has become a popular catch for a casual hookup or romantic encounter. However, while the idea of spending a cosy night with a guy may seem harmless, there are several reasons why “Netflix and chill” can potentially lead to miscommunication.
Sometimes, both parties may understand the phrase and other times, one could find out the romantic aspect once at the other person’s place. The inconspicuous saying has now become a bait-and-switch situation some guys use to rope in dates. Now, how do we know when he’s talking about an innocent movie date night or hinting at a rendezvous? Who’s to say, but one thing’s for sure: “Netflix and chill” has become slang for inviting someone over to casually hook up.
No, this is not just a tongue-in-cheek excuse I’m trying to use to stop your movie date at Ekene’s place this evening after Syntax class. And yes, Kola in final-year Law just doesn’t want to watch the Royal Hibiscus Hotel on Netflix and think about falling in love with you as Ope and Deji kiss to Johnny Drille’s Romeo and Juliet in the background after an expensive date night at Eko Atlantic that had rose petals falling from the sky, phew! Breathe in, breathe out! He just wants to get laid, and he’d play his game well; he’d be the best gentleman ever. Hell! He’d kiss your feet and want nothing more to do with you after everything.
Instead, I’d encourage you to ask him to make his intentions and desires clear — even if it feels awkward to say something like, “I’m really attracted to you. How do you feel about exploring this relationship sexually?” It might seem scary to broach the topic so straightforwardly, but the benefits ultimately outweigh the risks. You’ll get a clear answer, know where you stand with the other person, and can focus on whatever you’re watching on Netflix with them. While you’re at it, I’d probably place my money on binge-watching the Home Alone series together. It’s an all-time favourite! There are safety belts and the mood is clear as water.

The man in white clothing,https://punocracy.com/the-man-in-white-clothing/,2023-04-29T09:22:28+01:00,"By:Bello Favour
“Get in the car!” mom barked.
Like a shot, I scampered into the rear seat of the car, slammed the door and in the next couple of minutes, we were on the road. I could see my mom’s angry face in the rearview mirror.
Minutes beforehand, I had handed her my report card and she had been disappointed at my woeful performance. Despite having promised to do better than the previous term, I had gotten more Fs, and now repeating high school two seemed inevitable. Well, retaking the exams wasn’t much of a problem, but what my mom was going to do to me. She had whipped me the previous term and said that I needed deliverance from the spirits of darkness. I wouldn’t say my mom was a fanatic, but when it came to failing consecutively, especially in one’s academics, she believed a supernatural power must be involved.
After what seemed like forever, I realised that we weren’t on our way home. My mom was heading somewhere else, somewhere unfamiliar. I couldn’t ask her for fear of getting her angrier. At some point, I could see “Goodbye to Westville”, and I knew we were out of town.
We drove in silence for eternity, after which she finally pressed the car brakes in front of a building. My mom stepped out and was walking into the building when she stopped after a few steps and looked back at me.
“Why are you still there? Follow me,” she said.
I followed behind her and kept wondering what was amiss with her. Written boldly at the top of the building was: “A Place of Deliverance”, and I became creeped out. What on earth is this place?
Inside were people of various statuses — young and old. At a section, I saw people covered with dust and scattered on the ground. I wasn’t in a church because the pulpit and chairs for members were missing. The entire room was empty save for the people present, and I felt an impulse to drag my mom and flee.
At the corner of the room was a young lady in a peplum gown. She was shivering; maybe from cold or fear. In front of the young lady was a man in white clothing with a small-sized Bible in his hand. I thought it was an act when suddenly the man in white laid his hands on the lady, and before I could blink, the lady was on the ground, rolling like a flipped coin.
Soon, the man in white was walking toward my mom and me. I held my mom’s hand as he came nearer.
“Nice to see you again, Mrs Han,” he said.
“Father Augustine, This is my daughter, Cynthia, that I told you about,” my mom replied.
I was in a daze. How did they meet? And what did Mom mean by “I told you about”?
“Oh, you must be Amy?” he asked, turning to me.
“Yes,” I affirmed.
“Let’s meet in my office, Amy.”
He went off, but I just stood there waiting for my mom to say something, at least.
“Follow him and do whatsoever he says,” my mom said.
When I got into Father Augustine’s office, he was seated, so I took my seat in front of him. He appeared to be scribbling down something.
“Amy, If you cooperate with me, everything will be fine,” he said. “So I’m going to ask you a question and all I need is an absolute answer.” He then raised a question that no one had ever asked me in my entire life.
“Amy, are you in a cult?”
“Huh?”
“Amy, what cult are you?” he asked again, re-arranging the words as if that might be why I was confused.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Father.” By the way, I was not in any cult.
“You see, Amy, your mom came to me for help concerning you. God doesn’t want failure for anyone. Children of God exhibit excellence in all aspects of life, and failure shows that one has a relationship with the devil. Failure is what the devil uses to tie his prey. If you love your mom, Amy, you will confess your sins right now.”
“What? I’m saying nothing but the truth,” I screamed.
“Alright then. Follow me.”
We came out. My mom was still standing where I had left her. Father Augustine led me to the corner of the room where he had been before meeting my mom and me. Little did I know that I would be delivered too. I was trembling, and for a moment, I was in oblivion. Maybe I was possessed by the devil too, though I was in no cult.
Father Augustine came closer to me and laid his hands on me, but I felt nothing. He did it again, but I wasn’t on the ground.
“I see you’re tough, Amy,” he said.
He then held my head and forcefully pushed me. In a second, I was on the floor, squirming. To Father Augustine, my mom, and the people present, I had just been delivered. But to me, what happened was a sort of act that I could never comprehend.
It is the end of another term, and I’m holding my report card, waiting for my mom. I worked harder and managed to have Cs in all my subjects. I could smile now that no red ink could be found on my card. I did better this term because of my hard work and not because I was delivered from some spirits. Or maybe also because I couldn’t bare another visit to A Place of Deliverance.
But no one would believe me, especially my mom."
Nigeria and the 50 shades of shege,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-and-the-50-shades-of-shege/,2023-04-15T10:55:00+01:00,"By:Edwin Mamman
In this land, we have a term for suffering.Shege. The proverbial phrase,seeing shege,is a present participle that describes the action of going through it. And there’s levels to it, you see, because, in this land, we’re all in the same hell, just different levels.
Shegeis the most basic unit of suffering in this land, and there’s enough of that breakfast to go around regardless of your social status.
Shege Liteis a step or two above the basic unit, depending on your social class. It is those little inconveniences that add to your universal suffering, causing you unnecessary discomfort.Shege litecould be anything, like your gas finishing on a Monday morning as you get ready for work, knowing damn well that you can’t abandon your work to go refill it, and by the time you close from work by 6 pm, so have the gas stations. So you either risk getting fired from your job to refill your gas cylinder or endure an entire week of inconvenience. Ma binu boda, living in this land is an extreme sport.
Shege Proisshege liteon speed. At this stage, you’re really in it, as Greg from Everybody Hates Chris would say, “Dude, you’re so in there.” See ehn, when you’re inshege pro, o ti wa ni idoti. This is when things start to get real messy. This is when you go from shaving weekly to shaving once a month. This is when you stop by the roadside to buy ata of ₦‎200 and incur a flat tyre of ₦‎3,000, and here’s the plot twist: you have only ₦‎2,000 in your bank account and no spare tyre in your car trunk! This is when your gas finishes on a Monday and you can’t refill it until the end of the month, or the third day of the next month if your job decides to be an instrument of the devil. This is when your electricity unit runs out at 11 pm and you sigh a big disappointinghmmmas you cross your arms and legs on your bed, staring at the ceiling while your neighbour’s security light shines into your window. Ma binu boda, it’s all downhill from there.
Shege Pro Maxis thebaba nlaof them all. Theshegeof allsheges. The leveller. The respecter of no man. This is when you’re in it and of it. At this point,ko si owo.Even the upper class are not exempted.Shege Pro Maxis when you go from begging for urgent ₦‎10k to begging for urgent ₦‎1k to go to work because even the ₦‎1k is as scarce as live broiler chicken on Christmas day. This is when you and the rich hassle for the same newly redesigned naira note, when you and the rich all queue up at A.A. RANO because it is the only filling station selling fuel at ₦‎300 per litre. And in case you’re just realising it, the rich are very frugal. They would rather tongue-kiss a pus-infected sore than part with ₦200 naira extra on fuel; theydie there! This is when both roadside beggars and men dressed in neatly pressed kaftans beg you for ₦100 to eat because in this our land,shege no dey look face. This is when mothers cry as their children die because hospitals won’t treat them for free and banks won’t release money and even internet and mobile banking services are showing themshege. This is whenthe richhave stacks of old 1,000 and 500 naira notes they can’t spend becauselas las, e don cast. AtShege Pro Max,everybody feels the heat regardless of which level of hell they’re in.
In this land, they like to make us queue unnecessarily. They make us queue for our money; they make us queue for voter cards; they make us queue to vote; they make us queue to buy fuel. Pick your poison because, in this land, something must kill a man.
In this land, your job might kill you faster than a bullet. If you’re not dodging dangerously overloaded and tilting trailers threatening to fall on your head on your way to work, your job might just give you a heart attack by delaying your salary, again! After scattering youradashefrom last month and making you collect all thebashiin Africa. If they don’t succeed with the heart attack, they’ll punish you with crippling backache and bad posture from working 8 to 6 every day. But how dare you complain? You’re even lucky that you have a job in this land.
In this land, it is a dog-eat-dog affair. Everyone capitalises on any given opportunity to exploit you. The POS operators charge you exorbitantly for using their services because “money is scarce”. If you manage to spend your old naira notes anywhere, don’t expect change because they’re “doing you a favour”. The government will spoil you with electricity for three months before the elections and then pull the rug from under your feet afterwards, clinking wine glasses in their villas while you crinkle your nose and frown at the stew and goat meat in your freezer that is going stale.
But here’s the good news, if you can survive in this land, you can survive anywhere in the world. You just have to get out first.

Chelsea’s ungratefulness and why Potter should take legal acton,https://punocracy.com/chelseas-ungratefulness-and-why-potter-should-take-legal-acton/,2023-04-08T14:00:00+01:00,"By:Ajibade Abdullah Adewale
When I heard the loud and unusual noise of football fans with Chelsea fans feeling excited a few days ago, I thought the English Football Association had decided to disqualify the top 10 teams in the league and crown Chelsea as the winner. However, it came to me as a shock when I got to know that it was because Graham Potter was sacked.
What the hell!
Why would anyone sack Potter? This is pure cheating. It is not every coach that will be as gifted as this man; he’s the chosen one.  We all saw how he took Brighton to the Champions League on different occasions — the reason Boehly employed him. What else? We all saw the great work he was doing at Chelsea. This man solely carried the team to the Champions League quarter-finals, and the only way they could repay him was with a sack letter? These people are pure ingrates.
I won’t lie, this development doesn’t sit well with me, and I am as angry as a wet hen. I will advise Potter to take legal action against the board and the fans. He needs to reclaim his mandate and cleanse his credibility from those ingrates. If he were a Nigerian, Barrister Wike of Rivers State could effortlessly help him; it is his forte. Ordinary putting a call through would restore his mandate.
Chelsea fans need to understand that cutting off the head has never been the antidote to headaches — of which there is even no headache. It’s high time they learnt to trust and believe in the process. It’s not easy to be the league leader in the second table of the English Premier League. It takes a lot of resources and commitment. Kudos to Potter for that.
I am certain that Chelsea fans in Nigeria played a major role in this development. Yesterday, they complained that INEC failed to upload results on its portal; today, they complain that Potter does not have the best results. How exactly do they want to be satisfied? No result, they complain; there is a result, they lament.
Well, at this point, what Potter needs is to be obedient to my admonition and reclaim his mandate of integrity. On his mandate, I stand. If it means carrying a placard, on his mandate, I shall stand. If it means burning the rented bridge, I shall still stand on his mandate. This is a fight to restore Chelsea’s glory, which can only be achieved when Potter is at the wheel.

"Five years after, Samuel’s ‘red card prophesy’ comes to pass",https://punocracy.com/five-years-after-samuels-red-card-prophesy-comes-to-pass/,2023-03-24T07:57:56+01:00,"By:Oluwaseye Ogunsanya
In the build-up to the 2019 general contest, Samuel declared that the ruling party had given him “red card” and this would pave the way for him to join any team that has an ideology worthy of being adopted by his administration.
“As for team, I have been given red card and I’m outside the pitch. So, if I have been given red card and I’m standing outside, I’m a free man. So I don’t know what will happen next but I’m waiting. If others approach me, then I will tell the food basket people that I’m joining another football club. I’m a child of destiny and it’s only God that will decide what I will be.” he said.
Well after making the statement, Samuel went on to join another club which happened to not only be his former club but the main opposition club. He would go on to spend his final term as stated in his contract with the former club and eventually join a camp known as G5 who believed that the main opposition club did not adhere to its tripod principle of equity, justice and fairness in choosing leaders for the new season. This action split the club’s dressing room and affected its chances at the just concluded contest.
Samuel like other key members of the G5 camp except two had also seek to retire at the league’s upper legislative chamber but their ambition didn’t come to fruition as he performed the priestly role by volunteering to sacrifice his ambition for Peter, another fast emerging club leader from Labour FC (a third force) considered to be the best man to take the league out of the trenches of corruption and misgovernance.
Unknown to Samuel, his ‘red card’ declaration were not just mere words but words of prophecy which would become fulfilled 5 years after. Indeed as Samuel had declared that the ruling club had given him “red card” in 2018, it all turned out to be so in 2023 as he suffered a home and away defeat in the hands of the ruling club.
He first lost his bid to hang his boot at the league’s upper legislative chamber and he went on to lose the food basket which he currently controls to a man of his kind (a reverend father) from the ruling party.
As a “child of destiny” that he is, Samuel’s words about the ruling party giving him a red card failed to fall to the ground, instead it came to pass and it’s a match ban for him."
Press Release: This sham of elections cannot stand!,https://punocracy.com/press-release-this-sham-of-elections-cannot-stand/,2023-03-21T14:35:50+01:00,"By:Ridhwan Abdullahi Adetutu (éclat)
Dear Compatriots,
Relying on the sham of results so far released by the INÊC, we have cause to unequivocally state that the mandate freely and willingly given to our candidate, BABAYELE REWOSO of AAC at the polls on Saturday 25th February 2023 has been stolen.
What we have seen so far, to say the least, is not a fair reflection of our popularity strength and the wide spread acceptability we enjoyed pre-election and during elections periods. We know our worth on the ballot, we know our popularity strength hence we cannot accept what INÊC, in connivance with the media —mainstream and social media alike—is giving us. It’s a factoid, a sham that must not be allowed to gain traction. We are much more than that!
On several occasions, our candidate had been projected the winner of this presidential poll by many independent and reputable organisations, and most of these forensic projections were rightly correlated with our glaring popularity and acceptability strength amongst all and sundry, and across the length and breadth of our dear country.
In the build up of the elections, and as part of electioneering processes which are strictly backed by the relevant electoral laws, our candidate had traversed the length and breadth of this country, and he had done due diligence in selling his programmes to even the common man on the streets, and having resonated well with his plans for greater Nigeria, in return on Saturday, well meaning Nigerians in their large number thronged out to give him the historic mandate. It is therefore shocking to see this goodwill being truncated by the establishment forces.
Putting all of these in perspective, we have strong reasons to believe that these elections have been larged tampered with, and tactically compromised beyond measure. Therefore, the situation has left us with no option other than to explore judicial system for a legal redress. The people’s stolen mandate must be redeemed!
We have decided to proceed to the competent court of law to challenge these glaring electoral aberration and daylight robbery of the people’s mandate.
We thereby call on the general public, particularly our esteemed supporters across the length and breadth of Nigeria, to be battled ready. We have battle to fight —legal battle. The mandate the good people of Nigeria willingly gave to Babayele Rewoso has been stolen, and therefore we must stand up for justice.

"Nigeria elections: In reality, there are ballot boxes on social media",https://punocracy.com/nigeria-elections-in-reality-there-are-ballot-boxes-on-social-media/,2023-03-21T14:07:35+01:00,"by: Quadri Yahya
Ẹ̀gbọ́n Wale and Brother Kabir joined the ‘movement’ very early before the electioneering season became tense,  with ear-bursting loud speakers and troops in entourage of ‘our’ presidential candidate contesting to be Nigeria captain in Aso Rock.
My area brothers passionately waved their hands to the candidate on the day his campaign vehicle, with a crowd of well-wishers, despite sweating profusely under the scorching sun, strolled along a Lagos street.
Despite the fact that my bros are devoted supporters, they would not dare to shut their shops to join the ‘agents of change’ team because if they do, they may not make enough cash (in a cash mess era) to buy data subscription to campaign for the same candidate on social media, especially on Twitter.
There are a number of poor poos projecting ‘our’ candidate’s victory. And Statista also wonders why not, since there are 32.9 million active social media users in this popular county. It later turned out that less than this number could win ‘our’ man the post.
But in the end, ‘our’ candidate lost. You don’t need to pacify us. Here’s why.
Talk of popularity, ‘our candidate is well-known in the nooks and crannies of this county’, Brother Kabir would argue on social media. He would gnash his teeth when a liberal fellow who is adamant to join the ‘movement’ tweeted a neutral statement of enquiry: ‘Do you think your candidate can win this election, considering factor A & B?’. And my Ẹ̀gbọ́n will go berserk: ‘Don’t be so stupid. Can’t you see that God and the ancestors are behind this ‘movement’. This is our time. It’s youth o’clock!’
But in my censored curiosity, I asked my bros where they’d be casting their votes. But, not to my utter surprise though, none of them are eligible voters. I understand, through their grumble and litany of lamentations, that they’re termed ‘keyboard warriors’ and opponents sneered at them by saying: there are no ballot boxes on social media.
But I want to disagree with the latter remark.
On Feb. 25th, had the electoral empire not backstab the social media savvy and set up ballot boxes on social media, ‘our’ candidate could (no, would) have won without rigging in any part of the country.
Yes, apart from ‘the man of the people’, 17 flag bearers from different teams are in the boxing ring, trying to snatch the hardest WWE belt from the ruling party which will soon be over in May.
For emphasis, had the electoral body not changed its mind on where to establish on the actual voting day, we all would be in wild jubilation and hailing ‘our president’.
How the election was lost but won
You’re reading to reach the end of this analysis (hopefully). So I won’t bore you about the collation centers on WhatsApp and Twitter.
‘Our’ candidate lost because there was a dichotomy in Brother Kabir’s family: His entire family members liketheir person. They know little about ‘our’ candidate. To make matters more ridiculous, Brother Kabir was arrogant to explain to his family and friends (especially the bigot ones) alike why ‘our’ candidate is the best man for the job.
All he says is: ‘we no dey give shishi’. Where is the cash to give sef.
Secondly, there was no lubricant to oil the smooth process of erecting structures. In a county where one of the candidates sees the soon to be vacant post as birthright, and with the combo (his vice), strong structure could not be built in such a short period of time my bros and millions of frustrated members of the ‘movement’ want ‘change’, adding the fact that they are broke to give shishi to electorate that have been impoverished.
Besides, those that voted against ‘our’ are yet to be ‘liberated’. How could they stand against ‘our’ candidate who comes clean with pristine intent to rule us?!
But Global Data says they are not to be blamed because the county’s literacy rate just reached 77.62% in 2021.
Besides, Statista decried that, out of the over 200 million people, only 81 million of us have access to mobile internet, meaning they can’t connect with the message of ‘our’ candidate. So, you see why we cannot blame the women in Shagari gate Central market and peasant farmers in the hinterland of Borno street who voted against ‘our’ candidate.
Instead, let’s flog the 62.3 eligible voters who were reluctant to vote for free, even in the face of vawulence.
In the spirit of win some, lose some: ‘Our’ candidate really tried, especially with the unprecedented feats recorded in some districts.
Imagine a tenant slapping a landlord in his own house! Abomination of the 21st century political game!
But ‘our’ candidate is not a coward that will shudder in fear after his people were suppressed. Blind Mary Justice will do the justice! She will set the record straight and return ‘our stolen’ mandate. In Sha Allah.
And I will like to ask Ẹ̀gbọ́n Wale and Brother Kabir: when a bank transaction failed, what do a stranded visitor do: ‘He will try again’, they chorused.
‘Our’ candidate won on social media, we just have to make him the president. Let Elon Musk retire for now."
The people’s choice,https://punocracy.com/the-peoples-choice/,2023-02-23T12:12:11+01:00,"by: Chuks Chinyere
“The People,” who are mostly members of society’s lower strata, reside in the bottom of the pyramid for obvious reasons, which speaks to our collective inability to make the best decisions for ourselves, even if it smacks us in the face with akondo olopa. This is no fault of ours — we are neither educated or well fed enough, to think beyond our next meal — this is why we resign our political capital to career politicians who are best positioned by the Supreme Court to make the best decisions for us, while we gently grapple over the realities of surviving on N7,000 and grains of corn, till the next election cycle. When we’re not giving up our cognitive reasoning abilities to politicians and failing institutions who have not done the least to earn it, we’re relying on God to make for us, the decisions He had blessed us with a brain to task in such regard, which leaves a room for religious leaders practice some political prostituting.
No one is sure in great detail, after Saturday, 25th Feb. 2023, who INEC would say the Nigerian voters decided to make their President, but one thing that is certain is that the hope of the country will again hang in the balance of Lady Justice as represented in these parts by the Nigerian Judiciary. The Supreme Court of Nigeria will again find itself in the spotlights, or the mud as the case may be, with wrestling politicians, all of whom I suspect, will shamelessly help Nigerians realize the last hope we had stored in the refrigerator of our naivety as to salvaging what remains of our chances to making a Nigeria of our dreams through the ballot of a free and fair election, would have better been spent on hoping the EndSARS protests escalated to the point an interim government with Rev. Chris Okotie at the helm, was set to run as an absolute theocracy like Biblical Israel.
The Judiciary, referred to as the last hope of the common man, with the Supreme Court at its pinnacle, leaves us to refer to the apex court as theLast Last hope of the Common Person, where the ultimate breakfast is served. Not that a lot of ordinary people need to first get to a judgment from the the hallowed chambers of the Supreme Court to help them suspect the law was not made for but against them, lower seats of judgment like Magistrate Courts has opened our third eye into that state of enlightenment, which has helped us realize the best way to enjoy such shenanigans is to suppose that the laws for the rich was set different, and set so high us we couldn’t read them. But enter the Supreme Court – the Apex, not anyone higher, who in her absolute righteousness shares the unrighteousness of flawed judgment to reach everyone, both rich and poor, elite and common, like the breakfast it is. I can imagine a former Deputy Inspector General of Police like Udom Ekpoudom, sulking to his wife in his private chambers about how his senatorial ticket for Akwa-Ibom North-West Senatorial Zone, was ripped off him by the irrefutable judges of the Supreme Court and gifted to Godwsill Akapbio as compensation from the APC NWC, for losing out at the Presidential primaries. Or Bashir Ahmed, a member of the Northern Aristocrats breaking things in his study as he reads through and tries to rationalize how the facts in his favor spoke with the other side of it’s mouth thanks to ‘writs of summons’.
The President has cried again and again to the judgment of the Supreme Court every time pre-2015 after each failed attempt at the ballots to become President. I suspect the one time in 07 where the Supreme Court decided to uphold the elections that brought on the Yar’adua administration having recognized the said election was flawed. I am almost certain, it was at that very moment President Buhari made up his mind to flaut the orders of the Apex Court if he ever becomes President; I mean, who would blame him? Governor El Rufai would have a thing or two to say about The Presidency’s resolve to see through the nerve wrecking, bank crowding/burning – depending on which city you find yourself – hunger inviting, most importantly, vote-buy threatening new naira note monetary policy. Many other Governors under the APC like Governor El Rufai did seek redress from the subject of this discourse. The Supreme Court of Nigeria’s helmsmen have cried very loudly (again, the Supreme Court making grown men squill) when the President refused to obey the court orders on the validity of old naira notes. These are the same people that kept mum when Mr. President refused to obey similar court orders in Nnamdi Kanu and Dasuki’s cases. One would suspect these cases did not really affect the common person like the new naira note monetary policy does — ohh, very compassionate Governors we have. Maybe that is why Governor El Rufai, out of his strong compassion for ordinary Nigerians, is supporting a BAT for President against the will of a handful of highly influential Northern Elites as represented by “Elements in the Villa”. It must be El Rufai’s love for the victims of Southern Kaduna that makes him do all he does, knowing that these people are incapable of making the best decisions for them. What a sweet guy.
President Buhari prides himself as a converted democrat, and it is said that he became a believer on the site of The Dissolution of the Soviet Union “without a bullet fired”. This, I suspect, is what empowers him to disregard constitutional provisions for power separation, so that he can share some of these entrapped powers with those people around him to help rule Nigeria with him and take the blame for his most ingenious policies, like the New Naira Note. These people, many have referred to by different monikers, The Cabals, Elements in the Villa, The President’s Kitchen Cabinet. We can’t see them, but we can feel them, and like the wind, we know they are the people advising the President wrong on his bad days, which are many.
Plausible deniability has been one of President Buhari’s strongest suits, the Elements in the Villa being his biggest enabler. It does appear that the Elements in the Villa wants the best for Nigeria, better than what The People would ever want, and my interview with the Elements in the Villa have opened my eyes to their beautiful plans for this country — a country where the Northern Aristocrat will grow and strengthen her already stronghold on the country and her most valued mineral resources, even in the southeast parts of the country, simply because nobody know better how to enjoy the good things of lives like the Northern Elites of Nigeria. This is why they are working very hard to institute an interim government after inconclusive elections fueled by violence, riddled with economic hardships, engineered by the debacle of a monetary policy like the new naira notes, as advised by the unseen Elements in the Villa. It doesn’t matter if banks in Sagamu are burning down, as long as the oil fields in the Niger Delta got black gold in it, all is in order.
The APC on the other hand has proved to be the most people-centered progressive political party in the history of Nigerian polity, by fielding Nigeria’s most arrogant man and the North’s most outspoken tribal bigot, on the same ticket. The beauty of this APC presidentialMuMuticket is not that it has zero regard for one of the biggest Nigeria’s biggest polarizing factors, the issue of religion, which is the base for Nigeria’s strongest bane today – insecurity, and the snatcher of Nigerian lives across the nation. Many Christians have died, one lady was maimed and burnt on camera, while some other was kidnapped never to be seen again, all because their religion was Christian and not Muslim. Yet, the APC in its full arrogance decided that two Muslims on the Presidential ticket is no biggie, which speaks to their open-minded progressive ideology that promotes competence over religious affiliation. The Northern sect within the present APC structure supporting Tinubu’s dally to Aso Rock in hope that his old rugged bones will not carry him through the 4-8 year dilly-dally of an administration would last, so that they would have full control of our commonwealth, might just be in for some shocker as the southerner in company are lay in wait for such an opportunity. As the Bible says,those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. So as present leadership of the APC wait impatiently to plunder what remains of the country, one of our prominent men of God is advising us to lay in wait too, this time in patience, so that Saul will have a go at our dear frail lives for another possible 8 years, before King David comes to our rescue.
The People have made it clear they have no such time to wait, as naturally impatient as Nigerians are, they have done a damn good job of waiting in the last 8 years. From waiting in line for palliatives, to queuing endlessly for SIM re-registration and NIN re-capture. From waiting for voter registration and PVC collection to queing in the longest queue just to give away their old naira notes, to going home empty with the new naira notes to spend. As I write this, many are waiting in various parts of the country endlessly for the new naira note to touch their hands and fuel for their vehicles, but thank God we do not have to wait 8 months like undergrads to get our lives back on track. Our chance to make the right choice in a few days away, hopefully INEC will effect exactly what the President wants. The President has made it clear, as much as he can, that he wants to leave behind, on the sands of time, the footprints of a man who conducted a free and fair election that reflects the desire of the people. When further quizzed on the motive behind his desire, he noted that Tinubu’s disrespect for him and his shackle on the Star of Lagos affairs is in no way a catalyst to why he is trying to make sure Tinubu loses the election. He further buttressed that the mistakes of yesterday should not be deliberately repeated even though they were deliberate the first time. “This is not 2019, it’s my chance to show Nigerians that I care about their welfare, now that I am not on the ballot and have zero personal interest in who wins“, the President noted and finally, something we can all be thankful for."
Zero panic in the streets of London,https://punocracy.com/zero-panic-in-the-streets-of-london/,2023-02-14T12:06:36+01:00,"by: Chuks Chinyere
The English FA should know better than to allow the inevitable, linger and drag to the point where it can be proven otherwise. I see no reason why the trophy and the 2022/2023 EPL season is not already bequeathed to Arsenal FC as winners on the back of our outstanding performance so far. What remains to be seen after 51 points from 21 games, recording only 2 loses whilst sitting on the shoulders of two Greater Manchester teams? United fans already gave us the trophy after the 3-2 defeat, Pep Guadiola corroborated with his unending compliments for Mikel Arteta, the press approved that we already won this season, and Arsenal fans accepted. Does it matter if Brighton AFC and Todd Bohely screwed our winter transfer efforts, to weaken our squad depth? Waiting till the end of the season to determine whether Arsenal FC wins the league, is so outdated like Liverpool’s midfield.
Reasons why Arsenal should be gifted the title are; Mikel Arteta is the youngest coach amongst the teams in the title race, with the least coaching experience, managing the youngest team with the slimmest transfer budget. Yet he’s doing numbers Arsene Wenger did not pull off even in the year of The Invincibles, isn’t this incredible and worthy of special recognition? At the very least the EPL trophy should be moved to the Emirates for safe keeping.
Did you see Saka’s goal against United at the Emirates? What of Partey’s stunner against Spurs, which was a replica of a previous goal he scored, shows consistency, shows these boys are toiling day and night on the training field, perfecting their shooting techniques and moves, only for the hating ass English FA who sets us up with the worst referees, to match my boys up with Manchester City, at this dreadful time when our form is dwindling, it’s such a set up. It’s nothing but gross lack of trust on the side of the English FA, haven’t we done enough to earn the trust of all footy followers that the Gunners are winning this season’s EPL, what then is the reason behind putting to the test of facing Haaland and De Brune on the same team.
No no no, this is not panic you’re hearing in my voice (trying to hide the crackle in my voice), I am confident in my team. have already concluded, United is going to win the league next season. Rashford has found his form, he is killing it from left or center, the club has more fire wingers than Wolves has got Portuguese players. United’s defense looks very solid with a good mix of quagmire, but the coach is on top of things with the right kind of discipline and winning attitude, one would expect from a follower of Andrew Tate, especially with Mason Greenwood on his way back into the team. If I have my way, Man United would be celebrating their 2023/2024 EPL title right now, if not for anything, just to give my petition for my beloved Arsenal, some validity.
With only two losses out of 21 league game 50 points out of 2 League games in hand Arsenal is very well on their way to a 14th league title, sitting pretty in this jolly ride on the shoulders of the Giants of Manchester two games in hand and seven points ahead of third placed Man United. Notwithstanding, United is going to have an excellent season next year, especially with the premier league title race.
1 point from 2 games and you’re setting us on a date with City, so that they can climb on top of us, this is nothing but sexual assault.
It’s bad Ivan Toney grabbed that equalizer for Brentford on Saturday from an assist by a player offside, but terrible officiating was having its day. What is worse is, setting Arsenal up with two tough fixtures just after our coach who is a former captain of Everton tried to give his beloved former team a chance at escaping relegation by introducing Jorginho fresh from the other side of London with the Chelsea curse still intact. I know these game were predetermined before hand, but that’s besides the point. Deeds of goodwill should be applauded not punished with Haaland breathing down on Saliba whilst shoving his arm in Gabriel’s face, these people are actual humans not robots.
I know I’ve heard many say, Mikel Arteta became a Manager prematurely, having understudied Pep Guardiola for only a couple of years, without the experience and grit enough to manage a top team. I have been forced to agree that for the most part, that Arteta’s success at Arsenal so far has been driven by luck, he’s lucky the Arsenal Board are a patient bunch who saw the building process underway and did not cut him loose mid-construction when he was piling up terrible results. Lucky, he was an excellent Assistant Coach at City, one who actively contributed to the development, making it easy for the club to offload G.Jesus and Zinchencko. Same luck I hope would see us through trashing City like we always do, in our backyard.
I am not panicking, I have absolute confidence in my team that we would qualify for the UCL and at least reach the Semi-Finals of the Europa League, provided we meet United in the Quater-Finals. This is probably more than what we bargained for coming into this season,closing with a double or not."
What Essence is Tems without BigWiz?,https://punocracy.com/what-essence-is-tems-without-bigwiz/,2023-02-09T10:37:06+01:00,"by: Chuks Chinyere
Tems is an exceptional singer and songwriter, her rise is the fastest the Nigerian music scene has ever seen. Only less than half a decade into her entry to the Nigerian Music Industry, she has set the record as the first and only Afrobeats female artist to win a Grammy, but this feat is by no credit of hers, it’s thanks to the men in her life.
I am not talking about her Dad, the man by whose seed she became, by whose sponsorship she was bred and educated, even morally so much that she could withstand the rejection form Nigerian record labels over the argument that her sound was unsellable, so that she was provoked to start The Leading Vibe, the vehicle she used to make and promote her music by her hands. The men that takes credit for Tems’ exponential career progress, even this Grammy award, is neither Future nor Drake, the ones who collaborated with her onWait for U, the song that won the Best Melodic Rap Performance, Tems’ vocals being the very ingredient that made this record eligible for this category at the Grammys. The “men” that takes credit for Tems’ exponential explosive career success in the shortest possible time, is the shortest possible man to have the word “BIG” prefix his moniker, it’s no other person than (suspense pause) BigWizzzz (…and the FC goes agog).
Temilade owes her entire music career to Wizkid, it doesn’t matter how well her previous and subsequent projects do, doesn’t matter all the work she and her team put in day and night before and after her collaboration with Wizkid, the day Tems earns that highly venerated EGOT status, I will be here to tell you how Wizkid was the one who, like God the Father, looked down on her from his elevated throne of grace, that rests on the back of ⅓ of the FC with another ⅓ howling and tweeting of his greatness, had mercy on her, her speedily growing career and her exceptional voice, reached out to her, and helped himself to a collaboration that earned him the biggest song of his career till date. By word count, Tems contributed more to the songEssensethan Wizkid, word on the street suggests she wrote the chorus, which is the heart of the record, and most of the verses, but all that does not matter, Wizkid gave her a platform to showcase herself, as a selfless act of charity, she must forever be grateful and acknowledge this fact with every award acceptance speech she might give.
Tems is enjoying a full blown B class Hollywood celebrity status, attending Roc Natiion pre-Grammy brunches, getting premium attention on the Grammy red carpet, collaborating with likes of Drake and Beyonce on their respective albums, co-writing with Rihanna on one of her most anticipated musical releases, thanks to her much appreciated hits, propelled by her desire to rack up some cosmetic slash fashion billions. Snoop Dogg, the very guy the whole Nigerian industry celebrated Dbanj and Don Jazzy, only a little over a decade ago, for managing to collaborate with, on the remix of Mr. Endowed, a record which was already a hit across Africa, was on social media a few weeks ago, begging for a Tems collaboration whilst professing his undying love for this Wizkid beneficiary, like a typical SoundCloud rapper would. Tons of other unreleased projects with A list entertainers are possibly underway and I would suspect Tems is getting all this recognition on the back of Wizkid’s recommendation. It’s hard to imagine anyone reaching out to Tems’ management for a possible collaboration with this exceptional singer, notwithstanding her enthralling voice which is 100% hers, without first getting Wizkid’s express blessings. Wiz’s influence on her work has to be more than meets the eye, for the remaining ⅓ of Wizkid FC to find it impossible to refrain from reminding everyone of the bird app and everywhere else that, Tems owe her entire career to Wizkid’s grace, the same grace that didn’t do much for Terri.
Some people would very honestly suggest, Wizkid deserves his flowers for identifying the spectacular talent in Tems, and giving her room to shine on his most anticipated album. They will also try to chip in, how important it is to note, Wizkid befitted immensely from Tems’ contribution on the Made in Lagos album. But they would wonder, while the howling department of Wizkid FC who have taken it upon themselves to reiterate Wizkid’s invaluable contribution to Tems’ career at her every win, whilst missing the obvious benefits for him, find it a daunting task to revere Skepta in the same light, for his actual work of charity, in putting Drake unto Wizkid’s Ojuelegba, pushing for a remake, hereby giving Wizkid the career boost of a lifetime. The people who wonder these things are not me, I totally understand why Skepta is rarely mentioned as the very catalyst that made Wizkid an international superstar, I understand why nobody is suggestive of the fact that Skeppy’s loud and public acceptance of Wizkid contributed immensely to the growth of Wizkid’s British fanbase, so that he could sell out the O2 in minutes. Very honestly, it doesn’t matter if the Wizkid-Tems relationship is moresymbioticwhile
Skepta-Wizkid is giving parasitic, all that don’t matter.
As a true FC you have one job, shut down your critical thinking abilities, if you have none the best, drag down anyone and everyone. Wake up and begin the lies, in all things, make sure Wizkid is praised."
How to become an award-winning writer — From your very own favourite non-award winning writer,https://punocracy.com/how-to-become-an-award-winning-writer-from-your-very-own-favourite-non-award-winning-writer/,2023-01-30T15:49:36+01:00,"by: Dorathy M. Kolo
Dear reader and writer,
Do not dismiss the days of my little beginning. You might have seen that I’m not an award winning writer. However, this does not mean that you should not hearken to the words that I have for you. For if I had known early enough in my writing career, the secret to being an award winning writer,what is the Booker Prize, the Pulitzer prize, or even the Nobel Prize in Literature that I wouldn’t have won, eh?But because I have decided in my good graciousness to share these special nuggets with you, you should, you must and you will hearken. And you shall be grateful you did. So I’d admonish you to open your inner eyes and ears. Also, do not forget your pen and paper, if you want to get the maximum benefits from my teaching. See you at the zenith!
First, I want you to acknowledge that the most critical part of your writing is your creative process which is simply the way you come up with ideas, concepts and terms and how you incorporate them into your writing.What is writing without coming up with something worth paying attention to?
If you want to create the best pieces that will get you the awards which you so much desire, you should pay special attention to your creative process and get yourself into a state of mind where inspirations will start flowing steadily.  Fortunately for you, that is what I shall be dwelling on in this teaching.  I shall also be telling you the ultimate state of mind to be in during your creative process, and I shall also be showing you, step-by-step, the quickest way to get to the highest frequency in that not-so-secret state of mind.
I already know that you can’t wait to know what this state of mind is, do not be in too much of a hurry, the answer is very simple and it is something we all know; this is a state of mind that will get you to a creative high. William Shakespeare would definitely tremble whenever you come up with your pieces. This state of mind will make you so sensitive that you would begin to see things differently and you would literally be able to weave words into art, and art into words.
Statistics have it that the greatest writers usually have had rough lives before they make their writing debut (souce: trust me bro/sis). What if the reason you have not made your big break in the writing world is because you have it too comfortable? Why not make things a little hard for yourself?  Anything for the prestige,innit? Look, I won’t even gatekeep here, one of the easiest and most effective ways to make things hard for yourself, is to get yourself heartbroken. Yes, heartbroken.
If you’re lucky enough to live in Nigeria, things are already hard, but you can make it harder by just getting your share of a cripplingbreakfast. If you do not live in Nigeria, just get yourself Karens and Todds around, they’ll frustrate the creative juice out of you and they’re also evenly spread across the globe. They don’t even have to be blonde (yikes), they may be Black, Asian or even Hispanic too.
If by any chance, you doubt me, just go read about how Friedrich Nietzsche, who was a German prose poet, cultural critic and one of the realest MVPs in  contemporary philosophy came up with his masterpiece,Thus spake Zarathustra’after chopping a 15-star breakfast. You still doubt me? Why do you think heartbreak songs are the most touching of all songs? The profound feelings you get from listening to their cathartic melodies is nothing compared to the creative high you can get from an actual breakup.
So, without wasting time, I shall be listing, in six simple steps, How to get yourself heartbroken because I want to get you on the creative high as soon as possible, the sooner, the better it is for you.
Find your spec: You know that person you find very attractive? The one who is notorious for breaking hearts all around who has been showing interest in you and you’ve been avoiding because you don’t want your heart broken? Find him/her. Because you are ready to do anything for the cause.
Fall in love:What’s heartbreak without first falling in love? If you have been heartbroken before and you are scared of falling in love again, just think of the prestige associated with being a great writer and get yourself to fall in love. Keep talking to that person until you fall in love. A wise man once said ‘A Yoruba guy will break your heart but an Edo man will break you’.  Yoruba men are not the real demons, Edo men are. So if you’re a lady, for maximum results, just get yourself an Edo guy. I assure you that you’d be served a premium breakfast that would get you to that mental high that you so much desire.
Give it your all:At this point, I expect you to put in maximum effort, shower them with gifts, time and affection. Communicate with them as often as possible, intensify your efforts especially if it is one-sided and most importantly, ignore all the red flags. At this point, if the spec starts asking you out or starts behaving well, Just end it. Because they would interrupt the process.
Ask the big question:  If you made it to this point, I congratulate you heartily. Good things take time, I know you might have seen a lot ofshege, but do not fret, keep on keeping on. See, you don’t even have to go as hard as Friedrich Nietzsche went, you don’t have to ask them to marry you. After about eight months of talking stage and your putting up with their mess, just ask them the ‘What are we?’ question. I know it would hurt so bad when they say ‘We’re just vibing’, especially after making those one-sided efforts. But my dear, this is the time to leave them alone.  It’s hard but cut them off. You might start exhibiting withdrawal symptoms, therefore, I’d advice that you get a therapist. If you can’t afford therapy, your friends could give you some cheap therapy, and if you don’t have friends, I‘m sorry, but there’s no way forward and you are on your own.
Go to work:At this point, you’ve unlocked a new level in the creative high, I know you might have questions like ‘Why did Segun, Sandra or Aigbomode treat me this way?’ I need you to be strong for yourself and for the task ahead of you, this is not the time to slack, this is the time to create meaningful pieces, there may be just a few tears here and there but just take heart. Without pain, there’s no gain. Cry all you want but not too much.
Gentle disclaimer:  Do not harm yourself in the process, if you do, it’s not on me. Also, direct all the pain, frustration and anger into your writing.
Rinse and repeat: I know you must have heard it more times than you can count and it’s the truth:  Consistency is the key to being a successful writer, Keep unlocking new levels of the creative high. Moderation is also very key in this, don’t damage yourself in the process and blame it on me.
Thank you once more and see you at the zenith!

Artist makes history as he starts his concert early,https://punocracy.com/artist-makes-history-as-he-starts-his-concert-early/,2023-01-03T16:06:59+01:00,"by: Idris Braimoh
It was a surprise yesternight at the Eko Convention Center, Lekki as popular Nigerian artiste, Bard of Lagos got to his concert early even before his fans began to stream into the event center. There were gasps of shock and surprises on the faces of the fans as the show started early and ended at the exact time stated on the ticket.
We spoke to a fan who identified himself as Mr Emmanuel Wisdom, this was what he had to say. “To say I was surprised is an understatement, I have been saving up for this concert since January, sold one of my kidneys to enjoy ten minutes of singing his songs while he points the microphone at us, but to my surprise I experienced the four best hours of my life last night, selling my kidney was so worth it! I will definitely talk to my doctor about selling one of my livers for Bard of Lagos next concert.”
Punocracy spoke to the concert organisers and ask them how they felt about making history. “We were so surprised as you were, we were planning to sell tickets till four am, start the show at five am and maybe end at 5:20 am, but his early arrival put a wrench in the plan. We will definitely think twice about working again with him in the future.”
Punocracy also spoke to the artist himself, who didn’t look happy about making history. “I blame my personal assistant, he told me the show was at 7pm, that’s why I arrived at 12pm. I didn’t know the show was to start at 1am. Show promoters may never work with me again, my career is ruined!”
Punocracy is happy to have had our correspondent on ground to cover an unprecedented moment in history that we have been able to share with our intelligent readers.

"We don’t know why citizens are upset at extra-judicial killings, they should be thanking us — Nigerian Police Force",https://punocracy.com/we-dont-know-why-citizens-are-upset-at-extra-judicial-killings-they-should-be-thanking-us-nigerian-police-force/,2022-12-29T14:56:04+01:00,"by: Idris Braimoh
After the senseless killing of another Nigerian citizen last night by the Nigerian Police Force, an urgent meeting has been conveyed this morning between concerned citizens and the Public Relations Officer of the Force.
“I don’t understand the outrage to be honest.” The Police PRO during the closed door meeting said, according to our sources. “The police are just doing their jobs as Eco-friendly earth inhabitants who are trying to reduce the earth’s population, so the earth’s resources won’t diminish before the future generations get here.”
“The citizens are meant to be thanking us instead.” the Police PRO stated to the shock and dismay of the citizens who attended the meeting.
The one who couldn’t believe his eyes and close his mouth until the meeting ended was the President of the Concerned Citizens Association, Mr Dey Play who had this to say to Punocracy: “The only thing that prevented me from strangling the PRO was the escorts he had with him and the fear of God my late mother instilled in me, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, reducing the earth’s population? What is this? A Dan Brown Novel?”
The Police PRO who didn’t know he narrowly escaped beatings due to the fear of God, also went on to say: “Check the stats, the Nigerian Police Force is top three in the world, we wouldn’t be in that position if we weren’t doing something right.”
Another citizen who attended the meeting spoke to Punocracy anonymously to avoid the fate of being an unwilling martyr in the cause of population reduction. “The PRO also said they are committed to protect and serve, and that includes making sure the earth is protected, Who are they? The Avengers?”
All efforts to contact the Police for further comments have been futile at the time of the publication of this article.

Punocracy Person of the Year Awards [2022],https://punocracy.com/punocracy-person-of-the-year-awards-2022/,2022-12-28T12:04:08+01:00,"A lot has happened this year and it is high time we gave credit to whom it is due. Silver or gold, we have not. But digital medals we can afford.
The first time we did a “Person of the Year” awards announcementwas 2020. Not so surprisingly, some of the names have made a second appearance — some in the same category, in fact. It is also (not) surprising that all the top three contenders for the Office of the President made it to this year’s list. After all, they are the men of the moment.
It is important you know that this year’s award has been keenly – and kinly for one – contested, but as they say, thebestmen have won. Below is the list of awardees in no particular order:
General Sani Abacha— Philanthropist of the Year — For his latest allawee of $20.6 million channelled through the US government. General Sani did not disappoint his beloved Nigeria, as he once more came to the rescue and donated heavily to the cause of keeping the country afloat from the great beyond. The organisers find this awardee’scredentials exceptionally compellingthat the decision was reached unanimously! Though the bread was not (supplied) daily, he’s definitely stillour father in heaven.
Atiku Abubakar— Diasporan of the Year — For learning how to rebuild Nigeria through his extended stay in the United Arab Emirates while his party squirmed and whined back home. It is important we appreciate individuals like this awardee who will stop at nothing to record great feats. Literally against all odds and against multitudes ofhis party members’ worries, this awardee continues to spend the better of this year abroad. His love for Dubai is so much that one would think he’s a direct descendant of Maktoum bin Butti himself. (Not) strange,he even publicly retorted that none of his children wouldjapa; he seems to be technically doing all thejapa-ingfor the family. And yes, rumours once had it that he may haveapplied to the United States for a Nigerian birth certificate. What a Diasporan!
Muhammad & Aisha Buhari— Consumers of the Year — For being walking examples of the transformative powers of consuming enough slices of the national cake. Mr President has especially shown us how to be a baby boy in old age as he gets fresher even when Nigerians are seeingshege. The consumption pattern (and non-pattern) of the first family even made it to thefirst national topicrecently that it would be a miscarriage of justice for this award to go to anyone else. Mr President once noted thatNigerians should eat what they produce. But since Nigerians have refused to yield to that presidential advice, the first family has decided to eat all that Nigerians produce. In honouring the President’s mother tongue, the organisers of this award considered renaming the award title to “Su mama anchi kudin talkawa ankoshi”, loosely translated to “General Consumers of the Federal Republic” (GCFR) but had to ditch the idea based on some possible linguistic confusion.
Peter Obi— Crosscarpeter of the Year — For his “no time to waste time” style of politicking and how he has rebranded himself as a new blood despite years of being in cahoots with the old bloc. He has shown that you can be an old wine in a new bottle; it doesn’t matter. Mr Obi is so open-minded he does not see party lines. He only sees the pathway to a new Nigeria (where he is, of course, president).
Festus Keyamo— Defender of the Year — Nigeria’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment has done a good job of keeping Nigerian youth productive on the internet via his vitriolic tweets in support of Emilokan. Keyamo defends the indefensible, dignifies the undignified, and explains the unexplainable. No one came close to theSenior Advocate of Nonsense.
Godwin Emefiele— Public Servant of the Year — For his contributions to “improving” the Nigerian economy through “targeted” policies, and also for his contribution to partisan politics and legal jurisprudence in Nigeria through his “well-considered” presidential bid. However, some say it is not really clear if Mr Emefiele is serving the masses or starving them.
Bola Tinubu— Meme Inspiration of the Year — We appreciate the Bahubali Hullabaloo crooner for consistently dropping hit tracks and giving Nigerians reasons to laugh in the middle of untold tribulation. Choosing not to attend presidential debates (out of principle) would not prevent this man from speaking his truth — the way he knows how. From his legendary gesticulations to his Cicero-standard rhetorics, Asiwaju keepsa-maize-ingus with his victuals-inspired art.
Nyesom Wike— Entertainer of the Year — When it comes to Nigeria’s political scene, Governor Wike has without a doubt, been the best thing since jollof rice and this is not because of his seeming anti-party activities. (He fought enough pro-party battles already, though). The Ikwerre-born showman has delighted the auditory palette of all with the sensational antics of his band, whose timing and praise-singing skills are worthy of the Grammy.

"Being a baller, not a mechanic",https://punocracy.com/being-a-baller-not-a-mechanic/,2022-11-21T10:54:41+01:00,"By:Ojo Oluwaseun
Sweet Street (H)a(r)d-vice for Average Nigerians.
Please note that this missive is for average Nigerians. The reason is that they are the ones in dire need of becoming ballers. However, to know whether you are average in this context, use this formula:
Take the Net Worth of one of the top five on the Forbes list for 2022, then divide it by the number of months you have spent on Earth. If you have less than that in your bank account by the time you are reading this, you’re a mechanic.
You are an original mechanic, Aje!
That said, wouldn’t you ask where did terms “mechanic” and “baller” come from?
Well, here is the answer:
Baller:
While playing football or basketball, you will see people kicking and/or throwing balls among themselves to score a goal. And it is also usually for fun.
That is the origin of “baller” for you.
Because ballers are like that too, it’s just that instead of the ball, money is what ballers throw and kick around to satisfy their ego. And it is also usually for fun too.
Mechanic:
If you walk on the street of local areas like those in Lagos mainland, you are likely see some people by the road repairing motorcycles, tricycles or bicycles. Their lives are usually in circles, not in a straight line – no progress.
They usually always work. They usually always look dirty. That’s where we get “mechanic” from.
Mechanics, therefore, are those people who always have cause to work every day. From morning till late in the evening. Their work is not easy and they have little time for fun: tick-tock or Instagram.
Do you now see why no one wants to be a mechanic but a baller?Eh-eehn.
Having laid that beautiful background, let’s dive into the necessary tips you need to become a baller.
Tip one:
•Compare and contrast
Make celebrities the measuring tool of your life. Compare their lifestyles with yours, especially in finances and social media engagement. When you do that with passion and emotion, without reasoning, you will realize this:
That you too can be them even though you don’t have their skills. After all, everyone has one head.Abi what big difference is there between the monkey’s head and that of a chimpanzee?
Dragon flies. Dragonfly flies. Both are dragons. Both have wings. Then what is the difference? For reasoning sake, what is the difference?!
Tip two:
•There is no wrong source of money
It is always the end that justifies the means. As long as you get money and keep throwing it here and there, there is no need to differentiate between the right and bad sources of money. Who cares? Money is money.
Someone like me would understand that it is either you are into crypto-trading or you are a tech bro, and you may even be a secret rich kid. But to them, you are a yahoo. Don’t mind them. They are bad belle.
Naira Marley, may the blessings of the street be upon him, said and I quote:
“All of us are thieves. It is whoever gets caught that is in trouble.”
May you never get caught.
Tip three:
•Determination with a deadline
“Emi lokan.” Say it again and again. It is your turn to ball.
Make affirmation every morning about becoming rich. Listen to songs that talk of money, sing it along aloud like a mor-ney devotion. Talk constantly about going to Maldives and other places where enjoyment flows like a stream. It is a matter of mindset bro.
Work hard for what you want in all manner no matter what culture or religion says about it. Give yourself a deadline about making it. A goal set without a deadline is like a ship on the ocean without a rudder. If you are close to the deadline and still not make it, go desperate.
Daju, be cruel; Wu wa Ika, behave like a devil.
Tip four:
• New ways of life
You know how you present yourself too matters in this process. You have to adopt a new way of life: the one that attracts those you are trying to be like. Although you have not made it yet, you can still fake it for the time being. There is no law against that.
Your dress is your address. It is through it they know where you reside in the financial community. Put on expensive clothes and show them off. Let Instagram, Twitter and even Facebook help you with that.
Don’t post your pictures without captions like “fuck haters,” and others like that. Let them know you have arrived although you just set forth and your journey is still uncertain. But that’s how it works. You gerrit?
You see, I only can give you these priceless pieces of advice. It’s left to you what you do it with. One can only take a horse to the river, not force it to drink. Your destiny is in your hand. So when it faces you, shoot at it, when it turns back, shoot at it! When it remains just you, then rethink your decision.
And don’t forget, a bird carries with it only what it eats. And a pot that will taste a soup will first taste the fire. If this seems an uneasy process to become a baller, then, you will have to continue being a mechanic.
But trust me, you don’t want to live a mechanical life.

Announcing the Finalists: 2022 Prize for Satire,https://punocracy.com/announcing-the-finalists-2022-prize-for-satire/,2022-11-14T09:42:43+01:00,"We are excited to finally announce the finalists for the third edition of the Prize for Satire competition.
After through review and evaluation of a total of 145 entries received, we longlisted 22 entrants, earlierannounced. Upon further inspection and evaluation, we are glad to announce these entrants as winners of the Prize for Satire 2022.
1st:Toheeb Aremu Jamiufor his entry “Leaders of Tomorrow.”
2nd:Aaliyah Rahmanfor her entry “Why Everyone Should Study in Nigeria.”
3rd:Som Adedayorfor his entry “The Advanced English Dictionary of Nigeria.”
The evaluation of the articles was based primarily on the quality of writing, humour, socio-political relevance, and creativity. We are proud to mention that we recorded more balanced participation from both genders this year, with 41.4 per cent of the entrants being female while the rest identified as male. This is opposed to 25.7 per cent and 33.6 per cent female participation in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
We would be leaving the words of satirsts we admire, Elnathan John and Chuma Nwokolo, for your reflection:
“Good satire not only ridicules our political failures or cultural foibles, it is also a call to action. For satire to be this call to action, it must avoid things which may distract from this engagement. Poor editing, obvious grammar mistakes and overwrought metaphors, all stand in the way of engagement and more than most genres, satire must be meticulous. Satire can be subtle or brutal, and can use various styles, but it always has a serious concern. It cannot be flippant.  Like a person wielding a weapon, every stroke must be deliberate or one risks harming the wrong person or harming oneself.”
— Elnathan John
“Satires come with thorns; this is the nature of the art. To be effective, those thorns – be they soft or prickly – must be delivered on roses of distractingly beautiful writing. This speaks to a native balancing act of enchantment and vex. All this to say that the satirist’s anger must be subordinate to, and never overwhelm, his artistry. His literary devices must zing. They should be either novel or burnished, must be neither clunky nor heavy-handed. We the readers are drawn to wit, not to rage. But it is the writer’s superlative wit that gives him licence to rage against society’s failings. In the end, it is beauty – that lightness of touch, that spice shaker of humour and that creative nous of the skilled artist – that seduces us, again and again, to the pages of satire.”
— Chuma Nwokolo
We say hearty congratulations to everyone on this list."
Writing a proper nollywood epic romance: A guide,https://punocracy.com/writing-a-proper-nollywood-epic-romance-a-guide/,2022-11-13T11:29:38+01:00,"by: Raphael Francis
Prologue
In case you want to change your career, into something creative, or maybe you have had it in you for a long time, especially if you were one of those teens that appeared more often in your church drama, and you’ve always wanted to delve into the movie industry and didn’t know how to go about it, this is for you!
I would’ve charged tons of thousands for a two weeks virtual master class, or a one month writing workshop on this, but there’s no point in selling knowledge i got for free, what kind of human, would that make me?
So?
Here’s a guide on how to write a PROPER Nollywood epic romance appealing to your African Magic Audience.
Forget about the title first, the inspiration for a befitting title will come in due course.
First, you need to sprout up a magnificent Palace that sits like Zuma rock; wear it a fresh foreignness in pink, or blue of a warm sky, hemmed with creepy bougainvillea and manicured hedges bordering the house so that those yellow birds with the bright orange beaks can wake up its inhabitants with their syrupy chirping.
Make sure this Palace of yours is behind a high gate, if not, where would those guards with protruding chest stand? Stop wondering why you need all of these gigantic edifice for, you’ll get to know soon. Now, make the parlour big, with sleek leather upholstery and the Igwe’s throne riddled with a lion’s fur, or a tiger’s, anyone is fine, it always depicts the Igwe as a warrior King abi a king hunter, anyhow, just have an animal fur there. The parlour must bear the faint hum of the air conditioner and the satellite TV beaming down diets of CNN news and endless streams of word disasters. A scattering of nameless palace maidens, drivers, guards is a must, fix them.
Now, you need an Igwe, call him Mbanefo, or Ekwueme, no! Leave Ekwueme, it’s a title of a song, who even bears Ekwueme sef? Call him Agu, yes! it sounds exotic and traditional. Give Igwe Agu a doughy smile, a documentarian voice and the same fitness as the average twenty-nine year old. Not one of those big city twenty nine year olds who deal with mid-life crisis by buying ridiculously expensive gym gears, just to take sweaty photos for “break a sweat” caption on their social media. But the average twenty nine year old with a distended belly from all the beers hitting the wrong intestines. It’s important to make Igwe Agu menacing. A king that could be smiling, and ordering the guards to deal with you at the same time. Brute is necessary, especially in a Nigerian kingdom.
The Igwe must have a beautiful Queen, a moneyed one, who always wears heavy makeups and apparels just to roam the Palace. Make her quell disputes between the Palace maidens once in a while, at least, make her useful!
The Igwe will need Ndichies, bunch of egoistic chiefs, who drink local gins, and think themselves breadwinners because they can still achieve an erection. Make them sprawled on chieftain attires just to argue amongst themselves over frivolous matters like, if the estranged Prince, Igwe Agu’s only son should return from the Abroad or not. Note: the Igwe must have just a son, a crown jewl, e get why.
Make one of the chiefs popular, the way drunks are in small towns, make him a loud mouth that spew ridiculous cantsEkwensu aromances amamiwota, whatever that means. A comic relief is important, infuse one.
Now you need to have a Prince, give him an English name-calistus, caly for short. Make him a suave man, the kind that walks in a way people who have financially become independent on other people’s financial dependency often are. Give him a lanky swagger, a prominent chin, a dark and bouncy hair like the filling of a pillow. Force out the abroadness in him, by fire, by force. Make him the kind of American returnee Prince that wears leather belts with an elaborate designers logo as buckle.
His Nigerian accent must be smothered over, by years abroad as though with sand paper, let matter come out asmarah, make him speak rolling his tongue over syllablesi wanna gonna, c’moon ovurr here. Most importantly, he has to always wear a a smile peculiar to Nigerian politician’s kid who travels abroad by default, with dreams constantly cushioned with the right phone calls. Make sure he always makes references to how things are done in the Abroad, compare to Nigeria,like back in the states, youno we call niggas by ’em names. Back in the states, shit menh!
Don’t forget this is supposed to be a romantic story, introduce the girl at this point.
Call her Nkiru, because what’s coming for her later in this story, is something great. Give Nkiru an emotional appealing backstory, something that will make your viewers mouthehya, ehya, at will.
Nkiru must be raised by a single mother in the hardscrabble part of the town. They’ve to be poor, and Nkiru’s mother must be bedridden by a terminal illness, the kind that requires a lot of money for her treatment, which they don’t have.
Nkiru has to be teary with mucus sliding out from her nose in a rasp, especially when hawking sachet water on the streets to raise money for her mother’s treatment. Make her soft like a child trained to be quiet, like a child well-mannered in the unspoken language of her mother, knowing to leave the room when adults are speaking and to decline meals offered outside.
Now create a scene where Nkiru and the Prince’s path crosses, make it one of those days where the sky is viscous and turquoise: the hot, demented turquoise of a day filled with promises.Place her in one of those busy neighbourhood of small businesses fill with industrial rumbles of generators, that she would be deaften by the noise and not hear the car honking, until she gets knocked down by one of the prince’s entourage.
Make her falling dramatic, in slow motion, make it look like the world trade center peeling off like icing from a badly baked cake, appeal to emotions, make viewers mouth hundreds ofehyahs, from that scene only not minding if it is badly shot. Plant a crowd, let them gather round her, waste a lot of minutes on that scene, the story is almost coming to an end sef, make every minute count.
Later in the next scene when Nkiru is awake in the hospital to the full glare of the Prince and his American accent swimming through his words, give her a confused look; a mixture of sensuality and innocence, like that of a naughty child who had licked some sugar and was trying to hide it from her mother.
Let it be a love of at first sight thing. Their gazes glued together, she, trying to hide her shy smiles at him, picking god knows what from her nails, like a University freshman who was either innocent or dumb.
End things here, let your viewers figure out what comes next with an end note:
TO GOD BE THE GLORY
NKIRU’S MOTHER’S TREATMENT WAS SPONSORED BY THE PRINCE, SHE STOPPED SELLING PURE WATER AND WENT BACK TO SCHOOL, AND THEY GOT MARRIED AND LIVED IN HAPPINESS WITH THEIR NEW SON, PRINCE EMEKA, WHO CAME AFTER 10 YEARS OF THEIR MARRIAGE."
Wifely advice: How to be a good wife,https://punocracy.com/wifely-advice-how-to-be-a-good-wife/,2022-11-13T11:26:28+01:00,"by: Oluwaseun Ojo
Ololade Asake, I am glad you are here.
Would have written you a letter two market days ago to have heartily discussion with you, but Saamu, who helps with letters has not returned from hunting expedition. Head-master too went to visit his family in Lagos, would have solicited his assistance instead, and although you said most of his grammars are big for you.
In all, I thank God you are here, talking face to face is nothing like through written words, especially when it comes to matter of this importance.
You see, like I have always tell you, my words are like that of priests, they are from the mouths of gods. So, if I use my mouth cut colanut for you, you may choose not to eat it, but if I use it to advise you, it is best you take it. Your mother took it and she succeeds.
Being a wife is not a small task, and as long as I live on earth, I won’t open my eyes allow bad insects enter it – I would continue feeding you with wise words so that you succeed like myself and your mother in your new home as a wife. Let’s not leave important points to discuss less important ones.
‘Understood, mama’
Do House Chores Like a Slave
It’s your duty, not anyone else’s. Do it until your backbone cracks.
Asake, you must wake up earliest every morning to do the house chores; clean house and prepare sumptuous meal for your husband before he is awake. Always prepare his favourite or whatever he chooses to eat; I know you like your amala soft, if your husband doesn’t like it that way, you have to adjust. If he doesn’t like your favourite soup – isapa, don’t dare cook it, for our fathers say cooking a soup that the husband is allergic to is a taboo for a good wife.
Boil water for his warm shower on cold mornings; wash and iron press his clothes. Don’t be lazy, a good wife is not a lazy type, you see how your mother is always working round the clock in your father’s house? Always make sure your husband feels comfortable even if it’s by inconveniencing yourself.
‘Mama what if I am pregnant and tired?’
Yes, especially when you are pregnant. You don’t want to give your husband weak kids right?
Don’t be like them, those shameless wives who have collected trousers from their husbands and give skirts instead. They make their husbands do house chores in the name of assistance and love. Kai! That’s not love, it is slavery. They have turned their husbands into wives. Their male kids will suffer for it. The gods are angry with them!
Your Appearance is meant to Please Him Alone
Look attractive for him and him alone, but not outside for any other man. Wear perfume and waist beads in the house; always wear extra-large buba while going out to properly cover your bosoms. Avoid like leper, going where men are, to avoid their lusty gaze. You have no business with opposite sex except your husband and families. Don’t talk about 2023 election or ASUU Strike with an Okada man or taxi driver on the way to/from market.
Do everything in your capacity to arouse your husband’s sexual urge. Part of my advice for your mother when she was at this stage was to always empty your father’s sack and fill his belly; that is, give him enough sex, feed him best delicacies. For that’s the best way to keep a man to you, and prevent the husband snatchers from taking him from you.
Obey Your Commander-In-Chief till You Breathe Your Last
Don’t forget that he who owns the slave owns his belongings; your husband owns you, whether alive or dead, and whatever is yours. To be a good wife, you must learn to obey your husband. Desist from whoever your husband says he doesn’t want you to associate with. If he says he doesn’t want you to have friends, don’t. Wherever he doesn’t want you to be, don’t go. Don’t go out without his express permission, even it involves matter of life or death; if you do, the gods will rain courses on you until you return under his roof.
Never second-guess his decision. Let whatever he says be the final even he makes such decision based on inadequate or wrong information. Your major occupation is within the premises of your residence; you may use your skills to contribute to home but don’t be like career women who leave house in the morning and return in the evening like their husbands.
Learn to Endure in the Face of Adversity
If he can’t provide for home, use your understanding and don’t make him panic. Or else he will run away one day to those sugar mummies who will spoil him with enjoyment until he forgets home. Whether he performs his responsibility or not, he is your king, always treat him as one.
Don’t let intruders have access to your private life. Don’t be brainwashed by those feministic ideologies. Men will always be our kings, don’t be rebellious. There is never going to be equality of these two genders.
If he hits you, it’s your fault; one don’t provoke one’s husband. Whenever he’s angry, try to know why by firstly checking yourself, you might have done something wrong again. If he barks at you, quickly backs into a corner and apologize through chanting of his lineage eulogy. Hold him in the leg and beg. Cry to appease his angry soul. No matter what happens; always respect your husband and meet his every demands with smiling face.
Don’t forget, whatever you encounter is for the success of your children.
Ololade Asake, learn to endure.
You marry his Family as well
Your husband’s family are your family; his parents are your parents. You must respect every member of his family. You have to always display your good character traits to let them know that you have home training; don’t cause us any disgrace over there. Always smile. Never frown. Don’t insult any of his family member even if you think you have a cause to. You are there to marry their son, as well as them. Respect everyone and everything from his family, including toddlers and pets.
Don’t Ever Leave Him
Packing out your husband’s house is a bad thing. It gives you and us bad image in the society. The only thing that can draw you out of his house is your death. Nothing else. No matter what he might do, don’t divorce your husband. My mother never did it, neither her mother, me and nor your mother. If you are going through tribulation, pray to gods and be remain committed.
Pursue His Goal, Abandon Yours
To make your husband drown in your love and admiration, you have to do more than preparation of best meals and giving of sex; you must be ready to throw away your aspirations too for him to realize his. Take care of home while he does his career.
‘What if I do all that and he doesn’t seem to appreciate me?’
‘What if I treat him like king and he doesn’t treat me like queen, mama?’
Don’t worry, you will get the rewards on your children’
‘What if despite my caring and sacrifices he sees me as not enough and marry another wife?
Kai! Husbands don’t need a reason to marry another wife and… Asake, who are you to question your husband’s decision?! Don’t you know husbands are our small gods?!! In their shrines and worship, we shall forever remain!
And let me remind you: if youngsters have befitting clothes like elders, they cannot have rags like them. So, you better listen to me…
‘Mamma, but an occasion where befitting clothes need to be wore, we cannot wear rags, it will be disgracing…and…’
Keep quiet! And go serve your king!"
Why everyone should study in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/why-everyone-should-study-in-nigeria/,2022-11-13T11:22:44+01:00,"by: Aaliyah Rahman
Why wouldn’t you want to? From the free compulsory educational programmes to the free school meals, what is there not to like? I do not understand why 10.5 million children are not in school. I won’t be surprised if UNICEF is spreading deceptive figures to tarnish our image because of sheer jealousy.
Let me walk you down the chain of education the average blessed Nigerian is so privileged to have.  Nigerian public primary schools are the best of all the other primary schools in the world. I still cannot believe it is free. It doesn’t matter that the teachers are unqualified and mediocre at best. It is training for you to be able to strive harder to learn. When you think it couldn’t possibly get any better, you now discover that the children are given free food. Yes, the quality and portions are nothing to write home about but is that what is really important? Can you not see that the government is showing their dedication by wasting resources that aren’t enough to start with? Human beings can never be satisfied. I need to applaud the government for seeing that malnutrition among school pupils can be remedied with one free meal every day. Let us not dwell on the funding and implementation issues after all it is the thought that counts.
You may be wondering and asking about insecurity. That is not important because God will protect you. I cannot believe that the fear of being abducted or killed should be enough to stop you from going to school, especially when there is free food involved. In fact, the potential of bandits and herdsmen attacking you should add to your passion for learning. Where else would you learn with the fear of death hanging at the back of your head whilst getting an education?
Some people would argue that the overall poor funding of the primary education sector is the root of all its problems. That is why it is good to be educated so one wouldn’t make uneducated claims like these. I am not refuting that the quality of teachers and educational infrastructures won’t stand to gain from increased funding but it is not a big deal as many people are making it out to be. Holes in ceilings, dilapidated buildings and jagged roads only enrichen the learning experience. What is even the big deal if unpaid teachers aren’t teaching children at their most impressionable ages? Is it not common A, B, Cs and 1,2,3s? The children really don’t need quality teaching for good foundational learning.
In fact, the main problem in this country is the rampant fearful statistic mongering. Those greedy news and media houses only want to line their pockets to the detriment of the general populace. A good example is when that injudicious UNICEF representative, Peter Hawkins, had the audacity to say that  “an estimated 35 per cent of Nigerian children who attend primary school do not go on to attend secondary school, while half of all Nigerian children did not attend secondary school in 2021.”
It is this false statistic I will use as a segue to now talk about the joys of going to a secondary school in Nigeria. Please pay no heed to the various scandals Nigerian public and private secondary schools have been embroiled in. It is obvious that it is the work of the enemies. Think of how enriching the experience of stifling uniform regulations is.  And not to worry, I know you must have thought that corporal punishment was a preserve of public schools, but you would be delighted to know that private schools also employ a range of punishments to enforce obedience. Do not mistake discipline for wickedness. Cleaning toilets, cutting grass, kneeling for extended periods of time, destruction of personal property belongings and the occasional sexual harassment are all proven methods of enforcing discipline in long-standing institutions that are known to be citadels of learning excellence.
Overpopulation in public secondary schools is something that should be not been spoken of distastefully. Where else did you think that spirit of patriotism and familial love every Nigerian has comes from? Sharing a seat with three others in a poorly ventilated classroom tends to breed a type of love that words cannot do justice to.
It should be common knowledge that learning in an overcrowded poorly-ventilated classroom for 6 years of your life puts you at an unprecedented advantage compared to your international peers. It teaches you a high tolerance for foul odours amongst a number of other equally valuable lessons.
Remember the self-teaching technique that you learnt in primary school?  In a public secondary school, you would learn to polish that skill. You would have to find alternatives to laboratory exercises since the laboratories merely exist for decorative pictures in national newspapers. Do not worry about the less-than-ideal attention given to sporting activities. All the running from kidnappers on your way home should be enough physical exertion (education).
After 6 years of studying an outdated curriculum (because the educational boards understand the need to preserve history) and writing life-altering exams that teach you the importance of computer-rivalled memorisation and repetition, you have finally gained admission into a Nigerian tertiary institution. My major advice would be to add 4 more years to the duration of your proposed area of study. The Academic Staff Union of Universities understands that the concept of time is fickle and is dedicated to always giving students the time to explore their interests outside of formal education. In fact, they are so dedicated they embark on industrial actions almost every year. An added bonus is the entertainment they provide with their eventful legal tussles with the Federal Government. I have never seen such a well-planned educational system that prioritises the training and well-being of students anywhere else in the world. It does not matter if you spend ten years studying a four-year course, or if your education is truncated on a yearly basis. It is an opportunity given to you to test your resilience and cramming skills when the fragmented academic calendars have to cram months of academic activity into weeks.
The students that can’t afford the obscenely expensive tuition of private universities should not hold on to unfruitful resentment but should just go get a job. It is training even if they choose not to see it. This should not be seen as making quality education inaccessible for the average person, it should be seen as the altruism of the giant of Africa’s government. Which other government really thinks about the in-depth well-being of students like this?
Let me even let you on a little secret. I had no idea I wanted to be a writer until quite recently. I have ASUU to thank because how else would I have ever discovered my passion if not for the just called-off eight-month strike?  The long eight months allowed me just enough time to reflect. How they knew that the students required a long 8 months to relax from the stressful 2-month session is really amazing. They should be given credit for their immense consideration.
I could go on and on about the several merits of studying in Nigeria but my humility won’t allow me to show off. That and the fact that I understand that jealousy is truly the root of all evil. Publicising my country’s successes will surely rub a lot of others the wrong way. Contrary to what the headlines of insecurity would have you believe my country does not like violence. So it is here I will drop my metaphorical pen. A word is enough for the wise."
Why blame the man,https://punocracy.com/why-blame-the-man/,2022-11-13T11:18:57+01:00,"by: Rukayat Ogunlana
This man’s actions have been the series of last straws constantly breaking the camel’s back. He’s prepared just the perfect recipe for disaster in his relationship with this woman. Everything he should not do, he has done. He has flung every single word in his marriage contract into the wind. But really, he’s a man. Why blame him? Have you thought about the woman too? Of course, she must have pushed him outside and allowed him to see other women. A simple blindfolding task to shut the man from other women, she could not pull off. Then you come to blame the man? Rest abeg. The woman should do better to keep her man or she should rest as well, just like you.
I mean, let’s look at it too. Why can’t we focus on other issues and the people we need to blame for those issues. There’s climate change, there’s poverty in the land, there’s drug abuse, there’s school pupils not doing their homework, there’s ASUU strike, there’s the hike in foodstuff prices. What do we do about those? Let’s focus on how we’ll eat not how men are unfaithful to their wives and disrespecting the commitment they share. What are you doing about bandits? I’m not even trying to evade the topic, it’s just that there’s no need to call a man out for infidelity, he was most likely even snatched by the other person anyway. Poor man.
Let me explain this to you before you finish contemplating whether to stone my head or not, calm down, we are headed somewhere. Men are special creatures, they are the almighty’s beloved and they need to be treated like the kings that they are. You don’t apportion blames to a man even when the wrong he’s done is clear, you go about it tactfully. You rub his head and serve him three course meals, you dress-to-kill; that should kill whatever eye he has for any other person, you should then hunt down that person who wants to steal your beloved away from you, your poor gentle lover. How could people be so ruthless as to render your man so helpless and you, manless. You need to work against the evil forces to be honest.
Besides, the devil is always at work. Have you considered that? Wives keep screaming at their husbands to take breaks from work but don’t you all know that it’s in those idle times that the devil comes out to shine its teeth and wink at men? You want the man to take a break but you are not ready for the devil to come knocking in the form of anything wearing a skirt or trousers even. You are not ready to keep your marriage if you let him take breaks, you are also not ready to keep your marriage if you choke him to death with your presence in the house. Wouldn’t you let him breathe? Allow the man take a break or not. Nuff said!
Let me also let you know since you seem not to be aware that although women are weaker vessels, men are weak when it comes to issues of the groin. They automatically lose their ability to resist temptation and give in to anything that tickles their butterflies or their balls. It’s honestly not easy oo. Hmmm. Men have raging hormones, turbulent ones that overcome them and prevent them from being able to reason rationally or make disciplined decisions. Are you joking with “konji”? Come on, come off it! Only divine help can make a man decide to lower his gaze, refuse advances or be disciplined. So that’s it. I’m a good person, I thought you should know that fact about men. You are welcome.
By the way, in this millennial/Gen Z woke society, you are waking up things you are not supposed to wake up because why are you fighting against nature and coming up with new ideals? You think nature didn’t know what it was doing when it injected polygamy into the DNA of men? Look, jokes on you because you cannot defeat nature. Nature states it, on the leaves of plants, on the stem of trees, on the skin of tigers, on the sand on the earth. It’s everywhere that a man can engage in romantic and sexual relationships with other people even when supposedly committed to someone else. Even the thunder echoes it just before every rainfall. Aren’t you paying attention to your environment and what it says? Do better please. Mind you, don’t let the wrath of the thunder come down on you by trying to have relationships with other people when committed to a man. Stay in your lane, okay? Do you want your husband to get angry? Are you trying to disrespect him? What do you take your union for? It’s now a joke to you? Do you want to anger the gods and see their red eyes? Don’t you dare have relationships with other people, they don’t matter. Your husband does and he’s your head or do you want your head to break? Face your marriage, what are you looking for exactly? Exert your energy on keeping your husband, okay? Good.
It’s one of your duties as a strong, proper wife/girlfriend to school your husband throughout your lifetime on how to behave like a responsible adult, also remind him of how he promised to stay committed to you; he’s busy, there are a lot of things on his mind, he needs a little reminder every now and then. Do your best but don’t leave the serial cheater. He’s just a man, don’t blame him.  You know what is more practicable, let’s focus on everything else but not this man, he’s busy being the head of the house, stop stressing him. Rest!"
They’ve come again,https://punocracy.com/theyve-come-again/,2022-11-13T11:15:08+01:00,"by: Kayode Ayobami
Come, see them, six mouths in one body—
saliva in all corners like dewfall.


Bold rodent picking its teeth in the Face
of a landlord/showing its children the way
To the storeroom/shining bright like an ackee seed.


The pigs are here again, asking us to
Build them a golden pen/decorate it with


daffodils/fix a bathtub with roses in it.
Aren’t pigs known to befriend the dirt?


They’ve come to ask us for these seats
Again/of what use is their request if the


Keys to the seats are buried in their
protruding bellies of deceit? Of what use


Is your demand when you’ve turned these
Seats to your families’ birthright?


Hold your shields in your face, the rain of
spit of their lie is coming. Mask your nose


From their mouths that carry the sweet
Fragrance of soakaway. The polithieves


Have come again, flashing teeth like a
Hungry dog. Another eight years of


Delicious pain beckons; weightless
promises, obese belly, sweet silence,


Blistered and cracked soles chanting
The defense of a greedy demi god with


ailment that has no cure in his own land.
They’ve come again, tales tellers. The
Pausers of our dreams have come again
To nail us to a cross of suffering with their


Frailed hands and brains filled with greediness."

Commentary: The one who dwells in a place where he can neither see the pains of others but bask in the abundance of His orders shall stay sharp without shaken.
Commentary: The one who lives in Ando Rock, is the best friend of the people.
Commentary: The leader will always deliver them speeches of dollars and Euros.
Commentary: The leader who loves to choke the people and they want it. He plans to make rich out of a hellish budget.
Commentary: The police and SARS (Ṣ’àlàyé Runs) will be their friend, they will pick the people if they wear any peculiar style of dressing, they will ransack them if they use any expensive bling-bling like iphone 14 because they care about the wealth of the society. They won’t like anyone taking an abundance of it.
Commentary: Federal Road Safety Service Corps will stop them from driving, ask for their particulars and if found not guilty, they will write them a check of a sum of Naira to validate their cleanliness.
Commentary: E choke, choken’t it?
Commentary: They are no looters, just those who love to Abachalize the money for rainy days.
Commentary: Here the spirit is talking to the writer, to see the goodness in the hands of their beloved.
Commentary: In the writers period, Sapa is a friendly hunger which garri can always calm, although this is only applicable for those havenots.
Commentary: On this day, the leader will task the soldier to take out the weak for becoming strong. People are always meant to be weak, like a cute sheep.
Commentary: Ammo guns are the best in protection.
Commentary: What is culture when there’s a new wave?
Commentary: Cultures of old can’t speak correct English. They can’t relate with Technology. It’s better if you don’t learn them and serve English with your heart, soul and might.
Commentary: Be bold like Lion. Be wise like Tortoise.
Commentary: Happy are the people of Orílé

"Dear Elewaeji, or a masculinist manifesto on how to raise a beast",https://punocracy.com/dear-elewaeji-or-a-masculinist-manifesto-on-how-to-raise-a-beast/,2022-11-12T10:56:17+01:00,"by: Joseph Peter Akpan
Dear Elewaeji,
Feminism is the new COVID and even your son, Uwem is not immune to it. Take a look at the men today, what do you see? They have grown extra breasts and sprouted vaginas all in the name of accepting “equality”. Can you believe that our cousin – the great Akpan who killed a lion with his fingers when he was 10 and had the girls drooling saliva for a decade–now straps his daughter to his back and haggles over the prize of tilapia at Otor Market. Try talking sense into the idiot and watch him vomit nonsense about his wife being diagnosed with malaria and confined to bed — common ordinary malaria. Even when mama died (because her already failing heart could not process the news of papa’s infidelity), her spirit still stopped by the house to cook, sew, clean our wounds, and even romance her husband. You are a witness to this.
When I stumbled across the line “How will I preserve Uwem in his man form” in your last letter, I could not hide my happiness. It’s quite simple. Turn the boy into a beast.
Hey, don’t look at me like that. Elewaeji, The Universal Law of Masculinism states that anything that comes out from a woman’s vagina remains a woman unless acted upon by an external force. Being gentle is far from it. Now keep this in mind as you strive to preserve his manhood. Make one mistake and watch him become like Akpan.
Below are the steps to be taken as they are handed down from heaven. Amen. Inshallah:
Defeminization Therapy
First things first; start as early as possible to tell Uwem that he has just won the Penis Prize. This means there is a similar box for all men irrespective of size. Exorcize any enormous weight that comes with human weakness. Tell Uwem that “Man” means Numb, Harsh, Violence, War, Robbery, and Theft. Make sure you vaccinate him against the word “Balance”. If not, he will learn to listen to both sides, and trust me when I tell you that a masculinist’s greatest weakness is choosing the woman’s side.
Childhood Danger Signs
If Uwem watches Barbie Cartoon when he is 3, forget it. He will become a transgender at 18. Flog him mercilessly. Give him Achebe’s “The Trouble with Nigeria” to read. Remember how our father threatened to cut off our ears unless we recited Tolstoy and Achebe and Nietzsche when we were only 2 years and 5 months old. At 3, Uwem should know the history of Biafra inside out. If he can’t climb trees at 5, he is gay. Chain him and call your family priest for an exorcism. As the priest performs the exorcism, repeat “You are not gay, Amen”. Remember to rinse your mouth with holy water. If he becomes hot after that, let’s hope it’s pneumonia (and not gay fever).
Responsibilities
Tell Uwem not to assist his mother in the kitchen, even when she is critically sick. Tell him cooking (not eating) causes male asthma. Before you go to work, make sure you sneak out at night to plant new weeds so that he won’t have extra time to do “women’s work”. When you return from work, inspect his fingernails
Professions
Uwem must be aware that there are only four jobs for men: Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer, and Failure. If he decides to become a Failure, then tell him to choose between you and Failure.
Stolen Ribs
Refer your son to the book of Genesis. Let him understand that God did not take permission from Adam before he took his rib. Tell him in our world today, we call that “stealing”. Every potential woman out there is his stolen rib. He who finds a woman finds his stolen rib. When he marries her, he must keep his property under lock and key. He must never marry an intelligent woman who talks about politics, she could plan a coup d’etat right under his nose. All self-made ladies are insulting. Preferably, get a perpetual illiterate housewife with no knowledge of human rights. Tell Uwem that a side chic is not bad because there comes a time in a man’s life when the wife he married cannot stimulate his blood flow.
On Emotions and Failure
Don’t encourage him if he does well in school. Tell him it’s not enough. Compare him with your friend’s son (He must know that you regret having him as your child). Uwem must never ask for help, it is weak and foolish. He must learn to die in silence even when he is sad; even when he is bullied in school. That is how to grow tough skin. Don’t ever hug your son, else he grows used to your warmth. Don’t even pat him on the back. Tell him the day he fails at something is the day you will disown him. It is better he doesn’t try than to try and fail.
On Drinks and Smokes
Don’t believe everything you read in the tabloids. There will be awards given to scientists who discover that nicotine in cigarettes can cause 99% of lung cancers or blah, blah, blah.
Elewaeji, the world is not as our fathers left it. We men are not supposed to be happy. It is not in our place to live the way we want or respect women for the fact that they also are humans. Imagine how satisfied you will be when you finally make a beast out of your son. It means he will be feared (not respected). You will sleep well at night knowing that he is out there devouring anything that stands in his path.
Remember, spare the rod and spoil the child.

Roadmap to being a firebrand believer on Nigerian university campuses,https://punocracy.com/roadmap-to-being-a-firebrand-believer-on-nigerian-university-campuses/,2022-11-12T10:36:33+01:00,"by: Okafor John Oluwadamilare
Dear Kunle,
Calvary Greetings.
Bawo ni?  I learnt from my brother, your father, that you recently gained admission into the University of Lagoon. Hearty congratulations! Before leaving for school, I know my brother would have loaded your head with a lot ofacadatalks.
But you know that’s not enough, because according to2 Corinthians 10: 4, ‘’For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds’’.You see, it’s only the spiritual-minded that can survive on Nigerian campuses. There’s this spirit of doom ready to destroy the minds of the young on these campuses.
It’s unfortunate that today, we have a lot of lukewarm brethren on university campuses, they have given room to the devil and they are not bringing down revivals as in the days of old. In this letter, I will be highlighting all the strategies that helped me in being a firebrand for Christ all through my stay on campus. It will be of help to you and you can also share them with your friends in school.
Don’t be a part of those chewing gum boys hopping from one fellowship to another looking for TikTok girls upandan.  Make sure you attend all fellowship meetings even when they clash with classes.  Your horizon must not expand beyond these, as any other thing that comes after are distractions on your way to heaven. You should be heaven-bound and useless on earth.
Invest all your time in fellowship activities, don’t seek to find balance at all. The moment you seek balance, you derail from the path of life. Accept all the fellowship roles; Bible Study Coordinator; Hall Pastor; Faculty Pastor; DepartmentalPastor; Follow-up Popsi; Prayer Warrior Leader, just accept them all.
‘’To whom much is given, much will be required’’. Luke 12:48
Remember, you are the light of the world and as a light, you must not be a disappointment. The speech that comes out of your mouth must be seasoned with salted phrases like ‘’God bless you’’, ‘’ It is well’’, ‘’ “Peace be unto you” and ‘’Gloryyy!!’’.
A second must not go by in a conversation without you using suchedifyingwords! Other students must know that you are made up of a power higher than they are.
You should always add Popsi to your name, it gives it this spiritual relevance. In fact, during exams, always include it to your name on your answer booklets, so that you would be awarded extra marks; you earned it, after all. When you want to give a fellowship sister a handshake, let there be a distance of one meter. This will help you avoid all the fiery darts of the enemy. Hugs? Don’t try that! That will bring a stain on your spiritual whiteness.
You must never be caught fresh. Yes, I said what I said! Trying to look fresh will be an attempt to be a stumbling block on the path of your fellowship sisters. Avoid fitted shirts and trousers, they will make fellowship sisters start imagining things.
Using roll-ons and perfumes will ozz out the spiritual relevance in you which might also affect the spiritual frequency of your fellow brethren. You don’t have to always polish your shoes, they can always be pointing towards God as a mark of obeisance.
See, never avoid dressing in those colour riot dresses; that is what shows what a firebrand you are. Imagine wearing a glittering red shirt with red trousers, the devil will see you and run away. That’s because you are too loaded to be touched.
“But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fails not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren” Luke 22:32.
Prayer is one of our weapons of war. So, pray away; at whatever time you wish, and for as long as you want. Forget that you’re making noise.
Who dares call prayer noise sef? Pray at the top of your voice, even when your roommates are the ones on the receiving end of the disturbance. You should never pray silently; that’s taboo. You must wake up before your roommates and begin to blast in tongues; show them you didn’t come to the university to count academic awards.
When they — your roommates — confront you about your insensitivity and give you advice on how you can always use the fields in the hall or fellowship ground for prayers, shout at them! Tell them how shallow and lukewarm they are in the spirit; shove it in their faces!
You have to treat your fellowship EXCO as gods; they must be worshipped at all times. Whenever you go late to meetings and they punish you to go pray for five hours to build your spiritual web and stamina, you must always do as they say. You should never question their authority, as they are your school fathers and mothers who are ordained to lead you on the way of the Lord.
You should know by now that your fellowship president must always be taken care of; he must never be stressed since he is juggling tasks from the fellowship with his academics. In fact, as a gesture of love you should help wash his clothes weekly, as a way to show service and honour.
When you invite people to your fellowship and they tell you that they have another fellowship they attend; don’t believe them. Insist that they must attend your fellowship and tell them why yours is superior to theirs.
Rebuke the obstinate spirit that wants to hinder them from getting the best. Press their necks and choke them! If they make the mistake, sorry, a wise decision, of giving you their numbers, bombard them with text messages, WhatsApp messages, and calls. You know their room number? Make their room your next abode, till they follow you to church.
My son, Kunle, I think this should be enough to equip you in the jungle out there. See this as a starter pack, I will be sending you more strategies on being a firebrand believer on your campus. Expect them.
P:S: When replying to this letter, don’t bother to include your account details,silver and gold have I none; but such as I have, have I given unto thee.
Yours in the faith,
Most/Snr/Evang/Pro Peter Irapada"
Lip service,https://punocracy.com/lip-service/,2022-11-12T10:32:18+01:00,"by: Emmanuel Isidore Udoma
You were taught to take up your cross & follow Christ,
To turn the other cheek for another imprint of palms;
Instead, you put your fingers in another’s eye
Even when your skin hasn’t been scratched.

On Sunday, you garment in white singing in angelic voices
Heartrending, soul searching praise & worship.
Monday comes, you undress like whores before wenchers
Wearing the devil’s smile, you watch humanity shelved:

~ “Executhiefs” plunging our commonwealth
~ Paupers pauperized   plucking from their tree of plenty
~ Press censored   stuttering where tongues ought to wag.
~ Freedom & truth exchanged for costly silence & free doom.

Tell me how you love God when you spite at his likeness?
How do you sleep at night when you walk past
Penniless paupers praying you for a coin’s miracle?
How do you preach love when your heart is filled with hate?

At the market, a man screams for help as he loses his body
In flames to tongues rolled into an “O”. Ole! Homo! You’re a passerby
Watching his groans smoke into heaven. It’s justice, you say.
O just judge! Retrace your steps & be sure of no wrongdoings.

You complain about bad leadership at the top, yet
Your constituents prefer Hitler’s reign to yours
How do you throw stones into water expecting no ripples?
Remember, the truth is like oil on the surface of water.

Prayer Points
We are prayer warriors, fighting unspiritual battles.
We offer prayers for security challenges
And lacking social amenities. At every corner,

There’s a mushroom house of worship
Where we shout, Holy Ghost fire! Jesus!
The specious solution to our problems.

A tortoise crawls faster than our emergency services.
Here, the intensive care unit begs for blood and oxygen,
Potbellied politicians pose as powerful and influential
Yet call us, youths, the leaders of tomorrow.

Yesterday was the tomorrow promised our fathers.
Today is our foretold tomorrow:
When will our tomorrow come?"

Dear Baddie-bee,
I hope this mail does not meet you on the chest of Alhaji Danlami.  He is a lousy sleeper, isn’t he?  How will you say a man snores like tiger’s generator? Well, as long as his bank account doesn’t sleep, it’s a win for us.
My heart leapt for joy when your iMessage came in. I am delighted your first client is a big-fish, the kind that gives you a 3-day trip to Dubai just for valentine. Chizzy was not that lucky; her first client was an ousted senator from Ijebu North-east Local government. The stingy man lodged her in a four-star hotel and went straight to business after few bottles of vodka. No make-outs, no foreplay, just an array of relentless ramming with discordant yells of“who’s your daddy, say daddy, I’m your daddy”,can you imagine that? The worse part was when he transferred 20 thousand naira for t.fare and asked her to find her way back to Lagos. Isn’t that sheer wickedness? But you my queen, you are lucky, from now on, upwards and onwards.Konibaje baby.
My dearest Barakat, the major reason for sending you this email is to welcome you to the majestic world of slay-queens and give you some helpful tips that would help you navigate these murky waters.
To start with, please change that your bio on twitter and IG. Barakat is for your certificate and your parents, baddie-bee is for the world. You can leave the “God-fearing” part and delete the Muslimah. Add your zodiac sign, you are an Aries, March 22 chick, make a couple of tweets about how Aries behave and end with “what do you find fascinating about your zodiac sign”? The Taurus and Cancers might come for you, they are always the howling ones but you can be certain of soothing feedbacks from Leo and Aquarius. Don’t forget to add “soft-babe” or “soft-life only”, as they say in my languageenu eni la fi’n pe temidire,which loosely translates to “You call forth your blessings yourself”
Your media on twitter is empty, fill it with some teasing pictures. You do not have to show your face, a part of your laps is fine.  To make your timeline buzz, you can show a bit of your flat tummy or post a shot in that sexy bikini we ordered fromerotic shoppe. You can write a witty caption like “less is more” and use the heart button anytime a guy leaves a comment. You are not interested in those ones, they are broke, the rich ones will send you a dm immediately.
Of course, there would be the hypocrites and religious gatekeepers who will write gibberish on your timeline, but it is your timeline, isn’t it? To tweet is theirs, to block is yours. You are a paragon of pulchritude, don’t let anyone kill your vibe.
You need to open a virtual store and be an online vendor. You do not want those hungry bloggers with vulture eyes prying into your lifestyle, piercing your innocuous heart with horrendous words. Afterall, we are all trying to make a living in thisBubu’s economy.You can sell wigs, or shoes, or thrift outfits. We don’t know the difference between thrift and boutique these days so I suggest you stick with wigs.
I know Alhaji sent you 10 million naira already, that’s why I love those retired oil moguls. Those tech bros think they have money, see ehn, in Nigeria, nothing can beatoyelmoney.
I will be expecting my one million naira when you get back to Nigeria, you can share 500k with the other girls. Go to a big party or birthday bash of one of those influencers, book the front table and order drinks for the clique. Quilox is always a go to place but I hear South and Bayroot booming these days. When men see you buy a table yourself, the poor one pretending to be rich will flee, and the rich ones longing for the wealthy would come close, but those are not your targets, they are just a means to an end, a connection to the ones with generational wealth and surplus loot or don’t you want to eat from the National cake too?
Back to wigs, set up your virtual store, write witty captions and don’t forget to include “dm for prices”, size your clients up before you name a price but don’t overcharge to prevent being dragged, remember, the business is just a cover for the real business. Frontals, curly, bob, those wigs sell like water, and you can even make some small profit here and there.
Proper slay-queens don’t drag people, they watch their fans throw dagger of words at the draggers.  Your duty is to like and retweet any tweet you find intriguing, in fact you can mute the conversation altogether or retweet with a quote like“chasing dollars, not clout”.
There are a lot of other things you should know, like how to get the right angles for your curvy body that we are all jealous of. How to snatch a man from his wife and make his madam pay you off with thousands of dollars, flaunt your lifestyle in the most modest way, how to create a foundation that makes money and gives out a little, making the media and blogs your friends, how to string too rich men along and blackmail them for lands in Lekki-Epe, but for now, let’s enjoy the Danlami’s juice and suck him dry.Remember, the next time he asks you to spread your legs like a rumor, hold his armor, massage it a bit till he spills like akamu, and shrinks like a burnt rubber, then caress his eardrums with sweet nothings. That’s the only advantage of starting with these old men, they don’t last long but their wallet does.
Till the next time we see, remember, a slay-queen always slay, you do not bring anything to the table and you don’t have to because you are thegoddamntable, now let’s go get some credit alert, amen?
Till I write you again,
With all my love,
Abike, a.k.a Abby, the Sleazy Queen."
LMAO,https://punocracy.com/lmao/,2022-11-12T10:20:15+01:00,"by: Funminiyi Akinrinade
LMAO. You may not be far from the truth if you read this in Broda Shaggi’s voice. You may wonder why I began my message to you with “LMAO”; no worries, I can feel your wandering minds from afar. It is not like you are a joke to me, even though sometimes you can be. It is the state of your country that is making me laugh. I can read your mind. You wanted to ask me what I meant by “your country.” Like, are we not in the same country? Well, you may not be far from the truth. In the real sense, I am in your country, but I’m not there, if you know what that means.
You may wonder if I have lost my mind. Like,abi this one dey craze ni?Is he blind not to see the brouhaha happening in the country? Don’t be surprised that I can read your mind. Still, I cannot help but laugh. I owe nobody my laughter, the same way your country doesn’t owe you peace of mind. You should learn the language of laughter too. You know, it can be therapeutic.
Sometimes, you humans irk me. You point accusing fingers at everything. You blame everyone for your country’s state. To even imagine that you don’t spare your politicians. Are your people in power messiahs? Did they drag you with a rope around your neck to the polling units where you voted for them? LMAO. The majority of you even beg your government for virtually everything. You beg them to do things right; you beg them to do the right thing. You beg for jobs, electricity, clean water, food, strike-free education, tarred roads, security, and the list goes on and on. Beggie beggie citizens! You may start begging your government for the air you breathe in.
Last month, my eyes caught a headline: “Bandits attacked Borno mosque, killed the Chief Imam and three others.” And what did you do? As expected, you took your rant to social media—the seat of government of your time. LMAO. And what happened after a week of trending hashtags? Silence. Laughter. What happens to each person owning a gun? What happens to an Alfa holding a gun in the mosque while his head hits the praying mat? What happens to a pastor placing a shotgun on the pulpit while he preaches? But hell, no.
You want your government to provide you with 247 security. You even want your government to hold guns and RPGs. What happens to you honouring those in positions of authority? And if you ask me, what about the men in khaki? Like, isn’t their job to protect life and property? You may not be far from the truth. However, that reminds me of a headline my eyes caught a year ago: “Bandits kidnap two Nigerian soldiers on a major road in Borno.” Even your supposed security needs to be secured. LMAO.
Again, I read that your government and ASUU are in a tug of war, and your students are watching the battlefield from afar, speechless and helpless. LMAO. I mean, I find it funny. Should you embark on an indefinite strike because your governments aren’t meeting your demands? What happens to imparting knowledge to the coming generation and reaping your rewards in heaven? Or is heaven no longer the goal? LMAO. Your students are now into speakable and unspeakable businesses:CEO of Arike Store, Founder of Cryptomania, Prince of Cashapp, and Emi Oga of the Yahoo dynasty.You see what your students have become, yet enjoy the long strike.
Another piece of news caught my eye. Don’t blame me for seeing all these. I blame you for not coming to the rescue. I read that your country’s national grid collapsed for the seventh time last month, all in one year. LMAO. I find it laughable, you know. What is funnier is the fact that you blamed your government for this. Like, really? What happens to each household contributing a certain amount to support your government? But no. You all arenational greed.You are after feeding your belly, sitting with your legs crossed on your chair, and blaming your government for what you could have done.
Sometimes, you humans irk me, and you need to do better and become more responsible. If not, nothing will stop me from laughing at your predicament, not even you reading you."
Leaders of tomorrow,https://punocracy.com/leaders-of-tomorrow/,2022-11-12T10:13:46+01:00,"by: Toheeb Aremu Jamiu
The sonorous voice of the Mistress of Ceremonies is overwhelmed by the voices of the sycophant campaigners who sing same songs in unison:
Botie digbo, o ti wole   If you are not voted for, you are deemed elected.(x2)
When candidate(Koleosho Kamoli Kelechi)is called on to the stage, he struggles to hold the microphone with his right hand and waves intermittently at effervescent audience with his left hand, smiling at no particular person. It is hard to decipher whether the trembling is as a result ofglassophobiaor a medical condition which comes with old-age. A loyalist at the podium quickly forces the embarrassing hand down. Then, our candidate starts speaking.
He beams the party slogan:
“N.O.T.O.P”,
The audience choruses, “Our future lies on the aged”. Half giggling, half speaking, “Let me speak with the little sincerity left in me.”
The audience sing again:
Oniro paro foni ro o ei ei             Only liars tell lies to liars ei ei (x2)
He continues to speak: “Good day, my fellow young promising colleagues. It is indeed a pleasure to stand before you all as your presidential candidate in the next election to present my manifesto. As someone who has seen the east, north and west of this great country in my four decades in various government services, I have undoubtedly been part of the government but I am not the one governing.
The tide has come, a new whale has swum into the sea. I have 7 points agenda. Great people of Nigeria, if you want this country to be great, you need the aged. Stop believing anarchists who claim youths are better rulers and give examples of Liz Truss, Emmanuel Macron, Gabriel Boric, inter alia. Nigeria is not a country in Europe where meritorious neophytes rule. We, the aged ruin, (murmurs from different angles) I mean, rule our young ones in Nigeria. That is why we need old ones who have ruled this country for more than two scores to keep on steering the wheel of this country. Thus, our youths are the leaders of tomorrow!”
Extravagant applause welcomes the rhetoric. Someone in the crowd evidently in his mid-30’s, shrills, “ride on, Triple K, the President.” The candidate replies with benediction, “you shall become old too”.
He proceeds, “I don’t want to promise anyone ‘change’ because it seems Nigeria is jumping from frying pan into embers, then into fire then into hell all because of the artificial change. Sustainability is what matters, consolidation is what is important and productivity is what is essential in the areas of; education, security, infrastructure, employment, police brutality, economic growth and development.”
Education
“University lecturers would be starved, I am serious about it. No teacher should be earning what politicians earn. The highest form of corruption is for lecturers to compare their wages with that of a senator. No free education in Nigeria again during my regime because nothing comes from free investments. You see Awolowo’s ideologies are not practicable in this modern democracy. Let parents contribute to the education of their children. So, they could know the value of education.
Abdul, the youth campaign coordinator, sings to the microphone:
“Parents listen to your children,
We are the leaders of tomorrow,
Try to pay our school fees
And give us sound education.”
After appreciating the song with a hilarious smile, the presidential candidate continues, “We should stop singing into our children’s ears that they are the leaders of tomorrow without funding their education. Government alone cannot fund education in Nigeria. Besides, government cannot be funding those that would hijack its administration in the future. What we will do to cripple this country’s education sector is to force lecturers to go on strike. When they go on strike, punish them by not paying their remunerations; since students don’t learn from them, lecturers cannot earn from the government.”
Security
“My administration will ensure farmers’ land are destroyed by another farmers’ cows. After all, Nigerians should learn to tolerate one another. Cows are special and the herdsmen should be given special treatment. For the crop farmers, we will ask them to take heart for any destruction caused by the herds of cows because there shall be tunnel after the light.” Someone quickly but muffledly spoke to his left ear. “Oh, thank you, I meant, ‘there is lightening after tunnel’. Look, no one cares about good English nowadays.”
Mo kogbon ori mi beemi o kawe         I am wise if I am not academically educated (x2)
Iwe yato, ogbon ori malo je baba      Formal education is different, intellect is superior (x2)
Mo kogbon ori mi beemi o kawe       I am wise if I am not academically educated.
“Samu, I will consider you for the post of Federal Ministry of Education. Thanks for that evergreen song. As I was saying, I will command the soldiers to gun down anyone who has mouth to tell me they are starving. Another thing is that I will sanction the media if it reports banditry and Boko Haram activities. Those reports fuel insecurity in this country. Kidnappers and oil pipeline vandals when apprehended will be granted amnesty, with the aim of reforming them.”
Infrastructure
“In my first four years, I would collect taxes to construct infrastructure in neighboring land, like Niger, Chad, Cameroun, Benin. These would do three things; it will reecho that Nigeria is the giant of Africa. Two, the external infrastructure would attract foreign investors to come into Nigeria because had Tortoise have a smooth scute, people would believe his internal is smooth. Three, Nigerians don’t need social amenities that is why they vandalize them. Besides, Nigerians are able to live with undeplorable roads, lack of clean water, absence of medical care, absence of railway road, unstable power, inter alia. Thus, the budgetary allocation for infrastructure will be hidden beneath big tankers so no monkey could feed on it and no snake will swallow it.”
Employment
“Nigeria is too populous, the first in Africa and the sixth in the entire world. No reasonable man would think it is humanly possible to provide job opportunities for the entire youth population which comprises of 70% of Nigeria’s population. So, what we will do is to ensure that white collar jobs are hard to come by. We will buy the conscience of the youths and they would see us as a benefactor. This will make them justify every action of ours in unprecedented way. We will employ the youths to disrupt any constituency where the votes are not favourable to our party. The hoodlum who successfully snatches the ballot boxes  will have his bonuses increase. We will hang the photoshoot of 10% who get employed during our administration at the entrance of Aso Rock.”
Police brutality
“Bribe would be legally lawful for my country police. If you are too educated to argue that bail is free in a police station, you will eventually turn into the detainee. We will sponsor the youths who are comrades in Yahoo-Yahoo to lead the protest against the ban of EFCC. Activists would be battered in the presence of a court. Police officers could beat up a civilian without a justification. You dare not question why a police officer asks you to hand down your phone. If you are asked where you are going, and your answer is “somewhere”, you are a criminal. If your answer is “nowhere”, you are a bandit. If your answer is “why”, you are a criminal because only criminals question the police question. My administration will suspend the Constitution if it is against my policies. A 1999 book cannot be dictating how this country should be ruled.”
Economic growth and development
“Minimum wage would decrease. Economically, the high minimum wage we pay to the workers makes the rate of dollars keeps on skyrocketing in the last few years. So, we have to reduce that by improving poverty rate in this country. Nigerians are too overfed with corns that is why people get enough money to buy data and disparage the government. That is why they pay enough to media to publish the truth about those who embezzle public money. That is why ASUU members don’t lose weight after eight months of strike. We have enough. We will privatize most things for efficiency’s sake including the four refineries. The cost of repairing them is too much.”
“Our great leader who never says foolish things and never acts otherwise. When will tomorrow come for the youths to rule this country?
Koleosho Kamoli Kelechisays, “The problem of this nation is allowing youth to question people much older than their father. See, my last born from my fifth wife is twice older than you. So, shut up, and face your studies!”"
Japa: How to migrate away from Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/japa-how-to-migrate-away-from-nigeria/,2022-11-12T10:07:04+01:00,"by: Caleb Nnamani
I know you will want to read this. After all, you’re Nigerian.
But before I proceed, let me clarify that I am not judging you. In fact, I believe you are doing Nigeria a favour by leaving. After all, there’s nothing more patriotic than putting the green and white flag on your Instagram bio—next to the flag of the new country you’re living in.
As we all know, oil has been Nigeria’s major export since its discovery in Oloibiri. It used to be Agriculture, but who needs to export food when foreign companies can drill holes, pump oil, kill our vegetation, and give our undergraduates some local scholarships? Definitely not us. We’re big boys now, and farming is only for the illiterates. If they’re lucky, I will someday become president. Then the farmers will make more money, and your lunch will not be imported.
By the way, if you meet a good man in Nigeria, or a woman who is too good to be true, kindly check behind their necks and under their feet for a label. The truth is: they may have been made in China. When you see a good sachet of water too, the type that will not turn red litmus paper blue, chances are high that it may have been made by a certain Xi Pin Jin. If you like, don’t take my word for it. Just check our importation rate.
What God cannot do doesn’t exist, including our exportation problem. From many indications, it seems like Nigeria is fast rising to become a leading exporter of human beings. We might have failed to export cassava,garri, and beans in the past, but we’re now playing on another level— exporting people to European and American countries.
No, this is not another slave trade or human trafficking saga. I’m talking about an exodus of middle to upper-class Nigerians from the country. Immediately access to depart is granted in the form of a visa, these Nigerians willingly sell or donate all they have and move to their country of destiny. Sometimes, there are massive airport queues, but that’s good news, right? We are exporters, afterall. And the best part? We’re doing this so well, even better than other African countries. Now you see why we’re called the giants of Africa.
So, here are three ways to migrate out of Nigeria
Whether you’re a scholar or anolodo,a master’s degree is what you need. Of course, you won’t tell them when applying that you’re only going to come back to Nigeria for your funeral. Just say you want to change the world by learning from their universities, then cough out your life savings plus borrowed cash and pay for 50% of your first year’s tuition.
Never mind that you’re broke and maybe destitute at this point. Many jobs are waiting for you when you cross over. Some—or most—might require that you take care of sick people and change adult diapers. But see it as nothing. You are now in a land where things work. And, of course, people will only see what you post on Instagram. Not what you do with biodegradable waste. It’s a win for you!
If you want to get outside Nigeria, you must say, “God forbid!” when anyone calls you an independent woman or man. It’s not too much to tattoo “A dependant” on your forehead. Why should you be independent when there’s something called a dependant visa? God forbid again.
The issuers of the dependant visa might have strict criteria for it, but are you ready to migrate if you cannot manoeuvre your way through their unnecessary requirements? If you don’t know how to start, simply login to Twitter NG and ask for a dependant visa deal. You will meet other ambitious and courageous Nigerians who will work with you to achieve a common goal.
Although they may have never met you, they could add you as their dependant to get their visas approved. You might only need to settle them with small cash of about 50% of the total cost of processing the visa.
Good news: As soon as you both get to the airport on the other side, you can kiss yourselves goodbye and reclaim your independence.
Do you want to go abroad and maintain your sexuality? You must be joking. What are you even using yourthingto do in Nigeria? Don’t you know that over there, men that feel they’re women can be women, and women that feel they’re men can be men? Feelings are how things work nowadays. Forget the ancient times when genders were strictly attached to certain behaviours. That’s toxic and “not giving.”
I understand you may prefer being a man. Your name might even be Okunrinmeta. But don’t be afraid to take that bold step and wear lingerie to the embassy of your country of choice. When you get there, tell them you’re too sexy for Nigeria, and forever you’re that girl. If they probe further, say that Nigerians are persecuting you, and you just want to be free. Guess what they’ll give you next? They might call it asylum, but to you, it’s migration.
AFTERWORD:When you finally travel outside the country, try to live your best life. You may be crushed by loneliness and the effects of your skin colour, but always remember to look at your wages and multiply it by the naira’s surging exchange rate to feel successful.
If you were highly placed in Nigeria before you left, don’t worry if you find out that being a delivery driver is as high as it gets for you at first. Relax. Take care of yourself. Forget about Nigerian food because eating what your taste buds are used to could impoverish you. Eat fries and soda. It’s cheaper, but you’re richer.
One December, you will visit home with a fake accent and say, “I just got back.”
Until then, may the forces be with you."
Dear Wazobia,https://punocracy.com/dear-wazobia/,2022-11-11T10:03:08+01:00,"by: Chukwuma Chisom
Dear Wazobia,
It is with great joy and pride of patriotic responsibility that I received your letter dated 28thof September, 2022 where you expressed your apparent thirsty for political participation. Well, I was not bewildered as many a youth of your generation seems to have waken up to participate in decision-making in the polity. Will I say a step in a right direction? Not so soon, time will tell. Pertinent to this letter is your request for my advice as you dive into the ocean of 2023 campaign. I will open up fully to share the best experience I have gathered over the years.
First and foremost, there are three essential ingredients you need for this campaign. There are money, money and more money. It is the language of Nigerian politics. You must have bulk of it to disseminate at every segment of this campaign because it is the only manifesto the electorates want and even at the election day, that is the only motivator for people to come amass to vote. Be ready to pay for every support and endorsement you get as they say, nothing goes for nothing here. Well, don’t worry about the expensiveness of contesting election in our clan, my son, be motivated that a month revenue of one government agency can cover all these expenses. The DG of that agency only needs to come up with a well garnished cock and bull story of how ants swallowed it and that’s the end.
Hire loud social media warriors. They are called e-rats whose sole responsibility is singing your praise on social media on how you are the best thing after sliced bread. They don’t necessary need to have voters’ cards, the most important thing is that they are ready to eat anybody who tries to question your candidacy raw. You also need an advanced team that will be carrying placards at the border of every community to welcome you, pretending to be from that community even when they don’t know the community name. They will also serve as guests in all the events you will attend, singing your praise and clapping before you even open your mouth. Is it not you again? The Cicero of Zaza. As a Christian, visit every church and indirectly tell them to vote their own. Then go to the Muslim communities and fabricate story on how your great grand father was the grand Imam of Mecca mosque, so you are one of their own. Go back to shrine, tell traditional worshippers how you were offered up to the gods at the age of one and that you still sacrifice cow for the gods annually. Always play an ethnic and religious card. Please, leave issue based campaign on how to tackle insecurity or economic crisis, that doesn’t sell here. Ethnicity and religion trump over security of lives and properties. Even when you have to campaign on that, make sure that it has no basics. You must be a chameleon changing to the color of any group you are meeting with. For instance, once you enter southern Nigeria, tell them that Nigeria needs restructuring which top your agenda. Immediately you see yourself in the North, tell them to hell with restructuring.
Let me warn you. Avoid anything that has to do with intellectualism to avoid exposing how dumb you are. I know you have never been responsible in your life. You were academically poor. Your home are even been run by madam with little or no contribution from you. I am not trying to insult you but to make you see opportunities ahead that here we elect the worst among us to lead. Besides, is it not in this country that we preferred a candidate with debatable WAEC to a Ph.D. holder? Again, do not attend interview or accept any debate invitation. I told you hitherto that manifesto is not important but you need one. Just get 3 professors to write one for you. All those ravenous pressmen will be following you like birds to question the gut out of you, always refer them to your manifesto that you don’t even know what it encompasses. We have a lot of pseudo-intellectuals who will always insist we do it like the western world, you need the manifesto to massage their ego. Also, take one-hour course from HarvardX and start parading yourself as alumni of the prestige Harvard University afterward. This will project you as an intellectual. With these, you will surely become a household political gods in the mouth of many Nigeria.
Tell stories that shows your humble beginning and how down to earth you are. Stories that your parents were paupers and could not feed your siblings, how you had no shoes for school which is the main reason you are contesting to end poverty. If you have held political office before, don’t forget to add icing to the cake by telling how you took gala and sachet water as lunch through out your stay as governor to save cost so you could be able to pay salaries. Touching stories of such have catapulted many to sit of power.
Finally, two weeks before the election, meet with the leading candidate, collect money and negotiate appointment with him then go out, step down and endorse him telling your supporters that his/her experience is top-notch and you want to even learn from him. Congratulations, the gods of political strategies, you have just arrived in Nigerian politics. Incoming minister. It makes sense right?
Yours Politically,                                                                                                                            Wayaoma (GCON).                                                                                                                      Elder Statesman"
How to love a Nigerian man as a Nigerian woman,https://punocracy.com/how-to-love-a-nigerian-man-as-a-nigerian-woman/,2022-11-11T09:49:56+01:00,"by: Obinna Tony-Francis Ochem
Are you a woman and Nigerian? If yes, you are qualified to heed this advice. This is because there is another way of loving a Nigerian man, especially as a white woman or a non-white woman who is not a Nigerian. That’s for another day. Remember that as a Nigerian woman, for every aspiration, marriage is mainly at the forefront of it. If not, what are you here for? You are a Nigerian woman, and that’s what is supposed to be in your mind while trying to scale through your aspiration. Not getting worried about marriage is only for men. They will still marry when it’s time. At that time, they get a wife, and everything is set. But for you, a Nigerian woman, there is a time range for you to get married. If not, you will lose the one for you. It starts from 25 to 35 if you live in the most bubbling cities in Nigeria, like Lagos, Abuja, or Port Harcourt.
But in other states, you have to start thinking from 17 because at 28, you are seen as old and washed up. If you are from some parts of Northern Nigeria, you must start by 11 or 12 because it’s already legal to get married at 13. By 18 or 20, you might not be what they seek anymore. If you don’t get married by this time, don’t worry, it’s not the end. You will still get married when the time comes. What matters is that you get married and will be getting married to a Nigerian man.
Now that you are married to a Nigerian man, congratulations. This is an achievement. Even though it’s supposed to be a moment for both of you, it doesn’t matter much to that man. Remember, traditional marriage happens in your father’s home, not his own. Where people know you and everyone related to you will attend more than those related to him. You will receive all the congratulations, and after the ceremony, the marriage has begun. You might be clueless trying to get into this union. Do you know that your parents told you to go out there and respect that man? What are love and respect? It’s not clear enough. So, this is how to love your husband, right?
— Remember that you have to bring something to the table except sex because when you see those tweets on your Facebook feed, Instagram blog grid, and Twitter timeline, you won’t feel bad. You have to bring something to the table other than sex. It doesn’t matter that when you both return to work, you will cook alone, and your husband will be in the sitting room watching his favourite match. It doesn’t matter that you will take care of the children and house chores alone. After all, who will fix the light bulb when it spoils though you can do it too as you had always done it before you married. Who will change the car tyre? Not like your husband doesn’t call mechanics when it needs to be fixed or how many men in Nigeria can afford to have a car? Or who will put on the generator? Mostly done once in a while, and most times, you do it yourself. Those theoretical things Twitter patriarchs say are the same as multitasking house chores; remember that. Unlike your chores, it can’t be outsourced, you do it every day, but you must bring something to the table.
— Remember that how long your marriage is will tell how happy you have been and will award you the best wedding in comparison to others. Don’t forget it’s ammunition for your son or daughter when they support patriarchy in the future. They will tell Twitter folks how their parents’ marriage lasted nearly 50 years. You don’t want them to get ratio’ed with your marital woes when they tweet their random thoughts like everyone else with opinions. You have to make ways for them by being that parent whose marriage lasted so that you won’t cause irreparable damage to their image.
— As a young married woman, if you are active on social media and everyone knows you are married, remember to write on your Twitter bio. You are first a married woman before anything. Tweet marriage positive tweets and anti-feminism often. If your husband is not on Twitter, write in your bio that you handle this account. Don’t worry. You are already in the good books of your audience. When you tweet in support of Patriarchy, they will be everywhere in your replies like flies. One will offer you one bottle of cold beer, another will remind you how there is oil in your head, and some will ask if you have a younger sister for themselves or brothers. Now, we are back to what I told you before, men barely look for wives. When they are ready for marriage, they quickly look for one and they will find one.
— Lastly, remember that loving a man is only as easy on social media. In reality, it’s not as easy as tweeting that women should submit to their husbands. Tweeting in support of men and patriarchy. In reality, it is different. You will still be that bitter feminist even if you have never identified as a feminist for objecting to the minor things. So, you have to love a man like how other women before you have been loving their man. You will encounter all the difficulties. They love food, so you must prepare the food fresh and hot even though they used to compromise before marrying you. You must take the responsibilities of the house, and when you don’t do one like providing financially, then they will say you don’t contribute anything to the home except sex. Be like the idea of what they have of their mother in their head even though they are not remotely close."
Hard facts,https://punocracy.com/hard-facts/,2022-11-11T09:38:20+01:00,"by: Waliyullah Tunde Abimbola
Guy:Ẹ̀gbọ́n, as a socio-economic analyst, do you think…
Analyst:Socio-politico-economic-cultural analyst, you mean.
Guy:Oh, right. So, do you think Nigeria has handled her post-Covid recovery well?
Analyst:The real question is: Is there a post-Covid period? Because there cannot be a post-Covid period if there was no Covid.
Guy:Are you saying that Covid-19 was faux?
Analyst:Yes.
Guy:But ẹ̀gbọ́n, people died o. We saw on TV and social media. Pictures, videos and testimonies from reputable sources.
Analyst:Look at you. You don’t know how deep Western propaganda runs. All those sources of yours were actors hired by the Establishment. It was an agenda of depopulating Africa. They built a virus in their labs and they spread it throughout the world.
Guy:Who and who are thesethey?
Analyst:You don’t know? Jef Besos and Melon Mosque, of course. In cahoots with America.
Guy:But why did they have cases too, even if they were, as you say, fake?
Analyst:To make it believable, duh. They knew that some smart Africans would suspect foul play. That’s why they made it seem as though they were affected too.
Guy:But their plan did not work since Covid-19 did not kill too many people in Africa.
Analyst:Yes. But they had a Plan B. You know these Westerners, they are always thinking years ahead. Their Plan B involved those vaccines that they bandied around and the 5G network they introduced.
Guy:But what do they gain by depopulating Africa?
Analyst:Isn’t it obvious? That way, they can loot our resources more easily. The vaccines in collaboration with 5G will make men sterile and birth rate will fall. It will also solve their refugee problem. They can even turn Africa into a summer vacation continent. Now, let me blow your mind. Their ultimate aim is to wipe out all blacks in the world.
Guy:[Nigerianly]  Ah ha!
Analyst:Believe me. They are taking white supremacy to a new level. More advanced than Hitler’s idea ofübermensch— that Caucasians are overmen— while others areuntermensch— subhumans.
Guy:This is hard to believe, ẹ̀gbọ́n. We have intermingled with them. There are even blacks working for the so-called Establishment. They cannot have such hatred against us and still relate with us swimmingly.
Analyst:[as if to an imaginary person] Hear this boy. Do you think they will post it on their Twitter handles or announce it on CNN? No! It is a long term project and they are executing it slowly, silently.
Guy:That is disconcerting to hear. But that aside. What do you say about Buriha’s administration now at its terminus?
Analyst:Buriha’s administration looked promising. But Jibril’s governance is downright terrible, as we all know. [chuckles on seeing Guy’s astonishment] You did not know that too?
Guy:I thought… I thought that was just a blatant conspiracy theory.
Analyst:[heatedly] Of course not. The real conspiracy theory is them telling us that it is still Buriha that is in Aso Rock and not Jibril Aminu of Sudan. I mean, he came back from one of his medical trips and lo and behold!— his fingerprint could not open his office anymore. The First Lady said that her husband was not the man she knew. Observe the change in his skin tone, his height and earlobes. Did you also see the video where he was playing with his grandkids? I mean, Buriha’s grandkids? The kid ran away from him because, naturally, kids remember things better. When people see hard facts that they cannot stomach, they tag themconspiracy theory.
Guy:[heaves] I’ve heard strange things from you, ẹ̀gbọ́n.
Analyst:You have heard the truth. And the truth can be unpleasant.
Guy:Okay. How do you see this ASUU strike? Who do you think is at fault?
Analyst:Totally ASUU. Let me tell you, ASUU strike has external hands in it.
Guy:You mean foreigners?
Analyst:Yes. UK, USA, Canada and suchlike. These external hands pay ASUU to elongate the strike so that more and more Nigerians will emigrate to their countries so that they can make use of their talents. You know how brilliant most of our compatriots are. And they are succeeding. Millions of students and lecturers have left Nigeria between the start of this current strike and now. Millions! You may not know but that ASUU man— what’s his name?— alerts of hard currency ring on his phone every week.
Guy:But with thousands of members, how do they share the money? And how can they maintain the secrecy?
Analyst:Why are you like this? Of course they don’t share the money. The ASUU man gathers his acolytes and gives them shares. The rest suffer for nothing.
Guy:But ẹ̀gbọ́n, what they are saying is that our campuses are not conducive, what with the tumbledown lecture theatres and ramshackle hostels. Students sit on the floor, some lecturers don’t have offices and so on.
Analyst:Those are lame excuses. Students sit on the floor. And so what? Suffering is part of education. That is why our elders say that he who has not suffered cannot claim to be wise. So, it is for their good. And you said that some lecturers don’t have offices. Well, what do they need offices for? It is because they have offices that they commit sexual harassment. Their job is to teach. Let them write their lectures from home and take whatever paperwork they have back home. As long as there are lectures rooms, tumbledown or not, work can continue unabated.
Guy:I hear you, ẹ̀gbọ́n. Next question. What do you think about the upcoming Presidential election? People say that it is decisive for Nigeria’s future trajectory.
Analyst:Indeed, it is.
Guy: But ironically, we are presented with three— how do I put it? —unsuitablecandidates.
Analyst:Unsuitable as how?
Guy:Well, each has his deficiencies. As for Balo Amhed Tibunu, he seems medically unfit. Akuti Ababukar lacks charisma and has integrity issues. And his party lacks cohesion. Petre Ibo seems fraudulent.
Analyst:Fraudulent?
Guy:Yes. Even now that he is not in office yet, he prevaricates recklessly. Also, he presents himself on a platter of integrity. That mode of campaigning has gone outdated since Buriha’s election in 2015. Moreover, his campaign consultations have proven that he is not a new movement as his partisans posit.
Analyst:Okay. Let me enlighten you. This set of candidates is the best!— yes, you heard me— the best we will ever have.
Guy:Ẹ̀gbọ́n, this opinion of yours is unpopular o. People say the exact opposite of what you just said.
Analyst:People are bloody ignorant apes, says Estragon inWaiting for Godot. If it is hearsay that you want, you can digest what people say. But if you want informed facts, I will enlighten you. As for Balo Amhed Tibunu, he is a big gift to this nation. He has bundles of experience in governance under his belt. He transformed Lasog State from a jungle to a mega city. That state can compete with any other in the world now. And his health does not really matter. Even if he has to be wheeled on a wheelchair into his office everyday, with a brilliant mind like that, there will still be no problem. As for Akuti, he has experience too. And a lot of foresight. He is the Barack Obama of Nigeria. Have you read his manifesto? Abraham Lincoln would be impressed. Petre Ibo is not fraudulent. He is a top-class economist. He said he used one wristwatch for seventeen years and they said that he is stingy. No. That is not stinginess. That is conscious spending. It means that if he becomes president, he will know how each kobo is spent. And as for his integrity, our elders say that behaviour is like smoke; you cannot hide it. With those options, we are in safe hands no matter who wins. Who to vote for is a trilemma for me. An exciting trilemma.
Guy:That was really enlightening. Last one, now. The country is in a deplorable state. What do you think we can do to salvage the situation?
Analyst:What can we do? Our elders say that he whom you cannot beat, you hand him over to God. Praise be to God, we already have men of God like Odumeje the Indaboski Bahose, the liquid metal. We also have Guru Maharaji, the living perfect master. But we need more like them. In fact, we should have a Ministry of Prayers and Spiritual healing. That way, our few travails will be over in no time.
Guy:Thanks for your time, ẹ̀gbọ́n. May Nigeria be great one day.
Analyst:We are the ones badmouthing it. She is already great.
THE END"
Different shades of hope,https://punocracy.com/different-shades-of-hope/,2022-11-11T09:28:31+01:00,"by: ‘Kunmi Olamiju
Establishment Party’s supporters were mad, Hope Fighting concluded as he scrolled through the party’s Facebook page. He stopped at the latest campaign photo uploaded, a picture that featured all Bad Choice’s coterie.
At the edge of the group, the man’s daughter, Women Leader, posed with but apart from them. She wore gaudy sunglasses, looking visibly displeased. A few places from her, Dagger, the man’s infamous enforcer grinning maniacally, his equally infamous dagger, Death’s Kiss, strapped on a belt across his chest. When once the campaign had tried to distance themselves from him, Dagger’s stock had climbed as the election drew closer. Then there was the man’s son in a blue bespoke suit. Money Magician could make money disappear as quickly as it appeared. Close to him, the man’s pick for Vice president, Bad News, the biggest beneficiary of everything happening. His gaze was level; his lips held in a tight line. Hope shuddered. Bad News’s blank expression alone was menacing.
At the centre of the group was the man himself, Wrong Choice, or more accurately his corpse. His skin had the pallor of a preserved cadaver, and a cloud of flies hovered above him. He was held upright by a metal exoskeleton visible underneath the flowing robes he wore. It provided limited mobility and on cue, an arm could be lifted to wave when needed.
Despite the evidence before their eyes, his supporters carried on as if it were a normal situation. Hope sighed. He had to believe. He flexed his fingers, and began to type a long berating comment under the photo, his small contribution towards the election of Right Choice, in the lopsided fight against Establishment Party.
*
Like many people in Crazy Country, Hope had borne different names over his life. At birth, he’d been called Hope Abounds. In his teens, he was Hope Battered. As a young man, Hope Arrested, the name he went by the longest.
Never interested much in school, he’d completed a diploma program and after, focused on running his family’s electronics parts store. An only child he took his few highs and many lows the way he was raised; accepting them as part of a divine if baffling and at times disturbing, plan which would ultimately make sense in the end. It was the way the citizens of Crazy Country remained sane. In all things, giving thanks. Suffering, smiling, and giving thanks.
When the government evicted the family from the only home they’d known, claiming the building was on federal lands, Hope’s mother had only said, “In all things give thanks.” Even when it later came out, the promised compensation never reached them because it’d been shared between the local government councillor and a traditional ruler, his parents said, “Give thanks.” When his mother died from an Intracranial Teratoma misdiagnosed as malaria and typhoid at the state general hospital, his father kept up the stoic tradition of giving thanks. When his father was beaten to death the day after he turned sixty by drunk irate soldiers because his car overtook their convoy, Hope had well learnt the lesson of giving thanks and offered no protest when the soldiers were found innocent because the court ruled normal laws do not apply to them.
As the years rolled by and the shelves of the Electronics parts store began to have more empty spaces than goods, notices from dissatisfied creditors piled, his invoices unanswered, all despite Hope working ever harder and cutting personal expenses till the point he ate only once a day and lived in the shop, he bore no one any grudge. Least so the government. Politics was the furthest thing from his mind. The government was a beast to be appeased with dues and taxes while praying it did not notice you. Then one day, a year before Crazy Country’s general elections, a customer left a pamphlet in his shop. Its title was simply, “Why your life sucks,’ written by a Voltaire. He read the pamphlet because he had nothing else to do. By the time he was done, however, he was no longer the same man.
Voltaire’s radical but simple argument was that a country’s condition was reflected in the life of its citizens. When a country progressed, its citizens. When a country failed, citizens suffered. The reason things were so hard in Crazy Country was that Establishment Party could not steer the country in the right direction after forever in power and the time had come for change; change represented by New Party and its candidate for president, Right Choice. Right Choice was the founder of New Party. True, it had only won one election and it was at the state level, but they’d transformed the state under their administration. Voltaire’s last words were: “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.Vote Wisely! Your Life depends on it!”
*
It was a week to the election and the race for president was somehow still too close to call. New Party held rallies across the country in one last effort at swaying voters. Hope Fighting led the rally in his state.
They were fearless. Deep in the heart of an Establishment Party stronghold, they had to be fearless. Even as armed men began trailing them, like Hope, they raised New Party’s banner higher and beat their drums louder, peaking as the armed men charged the peaceful rally, attacking with machetes and broken bottles. It turned to a one-sided melee.
By the time, the scene cleared, the ground was stained red with blood and bodies lay motionless on the ground, Hope fighting among them.
*
Interlude
The creation of Crazy Country, if a little underwhelming, was a remarkably peaceful affair at the outset. There was no political revolution, ideological dispute, or theological schism behind it. No, nothing dramatic like that. The present borders, generously delineated by the white hand of fate, resulted from an economic pragmatism; the need to balance a budget deficit, and was achieved by the amalgamation of unwitting disparate regions. Talk about the Founders – the true khaki-wearing ones – however, once in fashion, is becoming increasingly passé. As for dismantling their Frankenstein creation, there’s an unstated acquiescence to not broach the topic despite the consensus not doing so makes everyone unhappy. It is a perplexing situation, very much like an unhappy marriage where the couples remain together to ensure the other’s miserableness.
– Excerpt from “Life in Nominal Nations: Crazy Country.”

He became conscious of his environment by degrees. There was first white light, and then the realization he was the sole passenger on an aeroplane.
He heard a voice announcing: “Flight H3AV3N about to leave Nigeria. Please put on your seat belt when the indicator light flashes. Your pilot will address you now.” Promptly, in walked a benign-looking middle-aged man in a pilot outfit.
“How are you, Hope?” the man said in a slightly British accent.
Hope stared, completely baffled.
The man continued, “I know all of this might be overwhelming. But I’ll answer all your questions soon. What was the last thing you remember?”
Hope’s hand instinctively went to his stomach.
“Yes, yes,” the man nodded, “you were stabbed.”
Hope finally managed, “So am I—”
“Not quite. At this moment you’re hovering. It could go either way.”
Hope considered this a while and asked, “Are you God then?”
The man chuckled and sat next to Hope.
“Only a humble angel. I oversee souls from Crazy Country. I’ve found this,” he gestured around, “the most effective way to help souls from your country, erm, transition. It puts them immediately at ease.’
“What happens next?”
“It’s your choice now. You’re what we call a special case. There’s much left you could achieve.”
Hope pondered. “Who wins the election?”
“Ah, the future. Not even I can predict the future. As we speak, a certain member of the Establishment is pulling her faction away, claiming her conscience would not allow her support a corpse as her father died on his last trip abroad. The truth of course is that she is unhappy with the slice of cake offer her—”
“It means there’s a chance?”
“You could say that.”
Hope grinned. “I’ve made my decision.”
*
He regained consciousness with a groan. He got to his feet slowly and brushed dirt off himself as best as he could. Daylight was breaking and he realized he must have spent the night outdoors. He struggled to recall what had happened before it came to him in a flash. The rally. Armed men. A glaring face holding a knife, rushing at him. Oblivion.
His shirt was blood-stained but he couldn’t find any injury on his body when he removed it. He shook his head. Thinking about it was too much strain. He wore his shirt again and began the long trek to his shop, limping. Undaunted, there was still time to change people’s minds before the election.
Hope was alive."
Vacancy! Vacancy! Vacancy!,https://punocracy.com/vacancy-vacancy-vacancy/,2022-11-10T10:17:25+01:00,"by: Akuboh Benjamin Mopa
The ‘Duke of Daura’ would be vacating Aso Rock next year and the country is set to have a new leader. Do you have what it takes? Find out below;
JOB SPECIFICATION
Are you between the ages of 65 and 99?
What our elders can see sitting down we would never see even climbing the Iroko tree. So please, if you have not made the transition from Iroko tree to rocking chair, don’t apply – let your elders with experience handle things till then
Do you have selective memory?
The medical term is amnesia. Although, naturally, amnesia is bound to happen to those in the age bracket specified above but God forbid our future president to suffer from a disease. So, the term is selective memory. You will need this vital skill when it is time to forget all the juicy promises you made during your campaigns.
Have you spent more than 50 years paying your dues for the service of our great nation?
Being a former army general or politician would be nice. A long-serving civil servant can also apply
You better not have a clean official record because those are for individuals who have not made great sacrifices. The great among us must also be controversial.
Do you belong to a religion?
You better not be a pagan, atheist, freethinker or whatever nonsensical terms humans use to deny the obvious existence of God. Yes we know you are a closet christian or a Muslim who drinks the finest bourbon in private but as far as you are regularly seen at the mosque or church that would do. This would be handy for when you would start making anonymous donations to these places of worship
Are you married?
If you’ve never had to take care of a spouse or children you don’t need to bother applying. We cannot leave the future of our great nation in the hands of one who has not even managed a family before.
Speaking of wife, we would like to know if you are a feminist. You should of course make promises of equality during campaigns and allocate a few key positions to women. But you better not really be a feminist. Do not be disobedient to God, he made you leader and protector of the home. Feminism is for advanced societies we don’t need that here.
What is your educational background?
Where is your primary school leaving certificate? Since you probably finished primary school in the early sixties there is a high chance you lost your certificate. Better rectify that before applying we don’t want to call those without certificates as certified to rule us. If you have further education that is a bonus but a Primary school leaving certificate would do.
Do you know how to communicate with the people?
You don’t need to be a good writer. In fact we don’t care if you are. You better have a team that will articulate your thoughts. Any individual speech written or letter addressed to the nation without proofreading is probably too error-ridden or even worse-truthful. So be humble and let your media team sort it out. Don’t worry about the rumors you have heard about politicians being capable liars. The lies will be drafted for you.
Who is your godfather?
Some have God, others are fortunate enough to have both God and fathers. But a politician has godfathers. People who like their names suggest can provide for your needs both as father and as God. It is not news that progress in politics is damn near impossible without one.
If you don’t have one it is too late for now, find one before the 2027 elections.
JOB DESCRIPTION
Now that you have seen the required qualities we expect you to possess let us explain what your job looks like;
OPPOSING THE OPPOSITION
If you are thinking you need to have an up-to-date curriculum vitae (CV) to apply then you need not worry. This job is focused simply on how many problems you can point out from the previous administration or from your opposing political parties.  How badly have they done? How many trillions did they waste? How many months did they keep students in higher institutions at home? How many villages were pillaged by bandits? How much worse now is the dollar-to-naira ratio  during their tenure?
Just arm yourself with the answers to all these questions and you are on your way to acing your interview.
DENYING YOUR OWN FAILURES
We admonished you to not have a clean record if you want to contest although this record will be brought up there is no need to fret. There will be few questions about how you plan to do your job effectively. Just tell them them how you plan to correct all the mistakes and especially those of the previous government and you are good to go. Asides the occasional interviews you would be appearing for on television (which to be honest will not mean much), you would need to prepare for your campaign tour around the country. You would need loads of your own money or tons of rich sponsors to be able to purchase the mammoth crowds that would ‘press the necks’ of your enemies. The correct term is fellow presidential candidates but no! They are your enemies. This is simply the art of war!
BEING DIPLOMATIC
A Nigerian president must be diplomatic. By diplomatic we mean showing up for every gathering of world leaders. You must attend these meetings for two reasons; first to show the world you are not dead and secondly to beg other countries. You are either begging them for money or begging them to forgive you for the money you already owe but you must be ready to beg. That is the true meaning of diplomacy for this job.
IGNORING THE PEOPLE
There would be those genuinely concerned citizens who would make the disrespectful mistake of criticizing your government. Please you are not to engage them. Who are they to talk to a whole Grand Commander of the Federal Republic like that? You are to immediately dismiss them as wailers or members of the opposing party but you must never listen to them. A weak president does that and you do not want to be a weak president.
The specific details will be communicated to you upon your election but for now this is all you need to know. Apply for this post today and earn your shot at taking our great nation from bottom to top. Good luck!"
A housewife’s manifesto in fifteen paragraphs,https://punocracy.com/a-housewifes-manifesto-in-fifteen-paragraphs/,2022-11-10T10:10:55+01:00,"by: Juliet Ikegwuonu
If you are reading this, you are a new bride. It wasn’t easy but you cleaved through the horde of scantily dressed ladies to become Chief’s 4th wife. I doff mygele.
However, the hustle is far from over. Not every Abuja girl successfully navigates the turbulent waters of upward mobility, but under my tutelage, you will go places.
First off, give him a son. Not just any son, his first son. Sure there will be other toddlers littering the wrong side of the marital blanket, a couple of daughters stashed somewhere. There always are. But don’t worry; they shouldn’t be a problem. This task of giving birth shouldn’t be left to chance. There is a man at Kwakwaba park. He understands these things. For a price, he will give you a little something to ensure your womb produces sons. Three healthy sons should do it.
It will do you well not to antagonize the first wife. The old viper can sink her venom into Chief faster than you can open your legs.Dey your lane!
Guard your wedding certificate. The original belongs to you. If your husband asks, get him a photocopy. Never. I repeat, never lose it. Laminate it. Keep it in your metallic box and put the locked box under your bed ready to be whipped out at a moment’s notice. You have come too far to be displaced based on mere formality. That piece of paper is what differentiates you from the women he buys apartment rooms for in Kubwa. Don’t lose sleep over these other women: many came before you, and many more will come after you.
Invest in items of clothing. Yes, my dear, nothing screams power more efficiently than tasteful clothing. At any time, you should have threeasoke: at least one from Dubai. It won’t do for one such as yourself to be seen wearing lace that everybody has seen.Tufiakwa. It shall never be your portion. If the recession is too bad, go to Agbado. They sell quality imitation lace. You won’t know the difference. You might need to befriend the saleswoman so she will give you a good price. The cost will pinch, but in the long run, the lace will pay for itself. Then you can also get anaso ebiwith your husband, to wear to wedding parties and funerals.
Don’t allow your unmarried friends to visit you. They want to shoot their shot with Chief in their tight pants and jiggling buttocks. Instead, meet them at the new bar down the street that caters exclusively to the upper middle class. Pick a seat at the corner facing the window where the lighting highlights your makeup to perfection. Offer to pay the bill and watch their green eyes take in your gaudy engagement ring and imported lace. They will hail you “Madam fire-fire,” and ask if you have any formula: perhaps a magic vagina. To which you will give your i-beta-pass-you smile. Promise to hook them up with some Alhajis in oil and gas. Then pick up your expensive iPhone and pretend to make a call to the local government chairman. That will show them that you are no longer on their level.
Invite your husband to your room, and after a vigorous session on the imported silk bedsheet, tell him of your desire to open a business: a boutique or a provision store, something to keep you busy when you are pining for him. He will like that. Then calmly suggest a store in one of his two-storey shopping plazas. Feeling indulgent, he will grudgingly give you a store. It won’t be the good ones on the ground floor, probably the ones closest to the restroom. This will frustrate you. But rein in your emotions. With a few chess moves, soon, you will be in charge of the whole building. But you need to strike early, while your breasts are still pointing north and the sight of your skin doesn’t remind him of overripe bananas.
If you cannot cook, get a girl from the village, one of those quiet and hard-working distant relatives with heavily accented Yoruba. People will know she is your house girl because she is always two paces behind your family carrying the heavy loads. She must be plain-faced and on low cut, or better still, ugly. The last thing you want is a forbidden fruit right under your husband’s nose. It won’t be the first time a village girl has taken over the house- remember what happened to Mama Bisi. She will bathe your children, feed them, clean up after them, take care of the house, and on school days, she will man your shop. She will even wipe your buttocks if you ask. Do not hesitate to correct her with your backhand if she so much as complain of fatigue. That will send fleeing the spirit of laziness.  Still, you must learn to cook your husband’s favorite dish. You don’t know when it might be needed to put out a simmering flame.
Familiarize yourself with your in-laws. Send them gifts at Christmas. They are a suspicious bunch. A trailer load of charm will not be enough to win them over. They are vicious and spiteful but they might one day be the only thing standing between you and a divorce suit. Locate the matriarch. She is the one that sways the herd. Help her pay her children’s school fees. It never hurts to have a familiar face in the other camp. If she likes you, she will let you in on family secrets and alert you to the scent of other women.
Brush up your English. Practice the basics for when your husband invites his colleagues home. Learn to be a charming hostess. Don’t embarrass him. Don’t let him forget that he hit the jackpot with you. Know when to blend in and when to stand out. Occasionally, you may need to make a speech or represent your husband at an event. This will boost your popularity and solidify your position. If you become influential enough, you could go into politics. Many woman leaders of political parties started with far less.
You will know other housewives. You will meet each other frequently at parties where you will begin to swap notes. They are easy to spot. Like you, they will adorn the arms of a man three decades older, appear in glittery clothes, smile the most and utter the least words. They know all the good gossip. They also know how to dispose of the blogger questioning your son’s paternity. You will share a few giggles with them but they will never be your friends. With each exchange, they are sparring for the top position in your social circle. If your husband is not the richest, you might need to endure more than a few barbs.
Your looks are your tools in the trade. Don’t let them fade away. Take trips abroad to see Asian doctors for a little fold and tuck every few years. But never as long as nine months. You don’t want to fuel the rumor mill.
If you must, take a lover. One of those young ambitious men that grace your husband’s parties; preferably married. Someone with as much to lose as you do. You alone shouldn’t be burdened with the task of maintaining secrecy. Steer clear of the artsy types! They are as predictable as NEPA. Young lovers are the best cure for melancholy. Their streak for adventure and staying power in bed will revive your youth and keep the glow on your cheeks faster than a shot of Botox. Keep him on a retainer for when you are out of the city. He will become more valuable when your husband can’t even get it up to take a piss.
Get a signature smile. One that doesn’t bring out your wrinkles but draws attention to the little dimple on the left cheek and the teeth you travel abroad twice a year to whiten. This might warrant practicing in front of a mirror for hours. Do not despair. Once it is perfected, you have a default expression for uncomfortable situations. It is this same smile with which you will read out the tribute at your husband’s burial, just before you take the next flight to England with your share of his estates.
If you do all these, I guarantee you won’t need to write a memoir to keep afloat.
See you at the top."
A believer’s appeal to unnecessarily over-enthusiastic believers,https://punocracy.com/a-believers-appeal-to-unnecessarily-over-enthusiastic-believers/,2022-11-10T09:56:03+01:00,"by: Kayode-Dada Ifeoluwa Lois
Hypothetically, three girls have been invited to a pool party on Victoria Island. In their excitement, none of them properly read the invite, hence: the first lady shows up dressed in a business suit, the second shows up in an outlandish ball gown and the third in traditional aso-oke, head to toe. The confusion that would result from this hilarious scenario is the reality of how religion is practiced in our country Nigeria.
“Unnecessarily over-enthusiastic” is a phrase coined from a rather sarcastic description of a woman who sat next to me in church on a lovely Sunday morning. She would always get up and scream at every opportunity, in fact, I dare say she created opportunities much to the dismay of my poor unfortunate ears.
As a believer, who now is being introduced to religion as it is practiced in Nigeria, I must say that I brought a knife to a gun fight (because apparently it’s just that, a big fight). I did some research and uncovered very amusing stories that led to the need for this appeal to the various faithful.
Noise is at core of this very first appeal. A myriad of complaints could be doled out by people who have encountered or can remember encountering this strange practice: praying at odd times of the night, in a public space! A poor friend was an unfortunate victim of an energetic, tongue speaking sister (torturer), who wouldn’t allow her sleep peacefully. The poor distraught girl had to endure all the “Shaddock ba lo bey bamoseeeeeeeee” all night because she didn’t want to disrupt the prayer.
Unnecessarily over-enthusiastic believers can be a catalyst for job opportunities.  This was the case of the young Muslim brother, who happened to be a gate keeper. He thought it right to leave his duty post to pray at hours when he was needed the most. Whenever he was called to question he always played his trump card “I was praying”. He expected his employer, who was so happy to have employed him to pray over her surroundings instead of guard it to keep him as an employee. The young man who got the job after his sack was availed a job opportunity he was immensely grateful for.  Jobs are not easy to get a hold of these days; therefore this is a humble appeal to our brothers and sisters in the lord to keep proffering a solution to this dilemma.
The plight of the pamphlets is another critical case that needs a vocal advocate. The printing press though, must be having a field day with the sporadic sprouting of various religious outlets. The horrors of being a religious flyer or pamphlet is one of the must underreported tragic story thus far. In every gutter, there is a church flyer that tells a story of a poor individual who was chased and cornered by an over-enthusiastic evangelist who thinks he/she won them over. An appeal for better working conditions of religious pamphlets is hereby made.
An appeal for religion to be made central in places where it is primary focus is pivotal in this next story. This story is set in a certain primary school where parents gathered together on a Saturday angrily to complain about a certain school necessity to the principal. Well, they asked that a mosque be constructed in the school premises so as to allow the children be excused during lessons to pray. It’s gladdening to see that the educational system is being forced to fulfill their duty to the children which is to make them pray hard.
Another vital appeal to be made is one against the weaponization of speakers. This dear tool has been used and abused much to the dismay of any individual who lives close to any religious outlet. Hell doesn’t seem like an interesting place but unfortunately the ears of the average Nigerian have gone to hell and back. The evangelists that carry speakers around will ensure that a lot of Nigerians make heaven, without their ears.
There is the “move of the spirit” and there is the “move away from the spiritually hygienic brother in the lord”. A characteristic of many over-enthusiastic believers is that they tend to fully embrace their calling and nothing else. This could prompt sorrowful reflection from victims who after being preached to could end up saying,“Omo, this one touch me o, thank you sir”. The forced answer you give to a preacher that has touched your soul by opening his/her mouth.
A landmark trait of unnecessarily over-enthusiastic believers is abundance of opinion. The popular street slang“you just open mouth waaaaaa” perfectly illustrates this trait. The most amusing part of is the attachment of divine backing to catty personal opinions. Imagine being harassed by someone and telling the person off, instead of getting an apology you get “sister it’s not me o, it’s God that said I should tell you, stay blessed”. Our brothers and sisters in the lord, you are implored to please keep your opinions to yourself.
Let’s address the classic trump card, “It is God’s will”. This is usually used to sugarcoat an act of irresponsibility that could have been conveniently avoided or lay to rest a matter that no one wants to pry into. Everything is always “God’s will” till it gets to more interesting topics and then “God’s will” changes to “our will” or “no will at all” in any case involving money. Our dear brothers and sisters accountability is also godly.
The last piece of the puzzle is an insightful one. It is an appeal premised on redirection of religious exercises to their main aim. This story perfectly illustrates the need for this appeal. On an early, bright and beautiful Monday morning, a young woman heard a knock on her door. On answering it she found, to her surprise two religious sisters with their trusted umbrella, humongous speakers and pamphlets. She couldn’t help but wonder whether these women had actually jobs due to the timing of their supposed evangelism. They proceeded to share their wise words with her as she waited to share her own gospel with them, the gospel of employment. They finished their monologue, and she told she had a couple of questions. Their eyes lit up only to be shattered when she asked them if they had jobs. She told them how they are in their youthful phase that shouldn’t be wasted. Her gospel seemed to startle them as both were rendered speechless.
Brothers and sisters, we do appreciate your diligent efforts to save our save our souls. Your bravery, virtue and love are recognized but the appeal is centered on etiquette. Counter productivity shouldn’t be the order of the day in your exhaustive military effort to take us to heaven."

Somebody should hold me o.
Ah!
I’m furious. Enraged. Incensed. Irate. Embittered. Righteous anger is brewing in my belly, splattering against my insides, spilling over.
I can’t believe that in this largely progressive generation of ours the stench of patriarchy still waxes brazenly. It’s utterly revolting. I would say I’m hysterical with anger but even the word “hysterical” has been polluted by the perpetual patriarchal propaganda to delude society.
No fam, I’m hersterical with anger.
So I was scrolling through my Twitter feeds the other day and I read that a prominent association in the country—upon concluding the football matches they organized to mark an event—awarded competitors in the female team less than their male counterparts. I thought it was a joke at first because, I mean, we should have grown past this, bah? Not so! It turned out that when the organizers were called out to explain themselves, they blushed in shame and began to raise money to make up for their indiscretion.
My Lord!
Please don’t tell me about how the female team played 1 game while the male team played 6 games. Rubbish! That’s the kind of chauvinist talk that makes me want to gag. Equality is equality. If women were not so oppressed in the first place, they’d have played more than one game. Like, did anyone care to ask them?
It’s the same bullshit reasons the system uses to justify the pay discrepancy between both genders in international sports: Male sports generate more revenue, female sports generate less; they pay according to income generated and other stories that touch the heart. Look, I know I’ve never watched any female football match and that I don’t know the name of any female footballer, but that’s besides the point. It’s my right to watch anything I want to watch, but it’s the duty of managers to pay female players as much as their male counterparts regardless of how much income the different teams generate, period!
Until we begin to take cues from countries like Rwanda, we are doomed to mediocrity. Rwanda has a female majority in the parliament, 61.3% for the lower house and 38.5% for the upper house—ask Wikipedia. Now, that’s a nation that truly understands egalitarianism. No wonder they are doing so well.
Please let’s not wait to be called out before doing what’s reasonable and right.:⁠-⁠(

Lol.
Mind you, this lol is dripping with bitterness and caustic sarcasm. Because you see, there’s nothing remotely lol-vely about privileged but retrogressive, unempathic, and unsophisticated individuals who pride in their ignorance and are intolerant to change and inclusion.
In fact, for this particular journal entry, lol is short for lashing out literarily.
It’s crazy, but someone actually had the temerity to tweet something as unfeeling as, “Transwomen are transwomen; transmen are transmen; women are women; men are men. Let’s not get it twisted.”
What? For real?
I was eating at first, but after being struck by the stink of that very transphobic tweet I was so nauseated I couldn’t eat anymore.
Trust twitter, there was a rampage!
My compatriots and I screamed murder and injustice, urging everyone to cancel the fellow until the tweet was rescinded.
Lol!
Like who do you think you are to dictate what people are? Who do you think you are to put labels on people and marginalize them because of what they are? Who even created this stupid system of gender assignment? Who even created laws?
Yes, who created laws?
Like why should a dumb meter rule define me as 5’1 when I see myself as a 5’11? And why should a mere machine tell me that I have insufficient balance in my own account? In fact, who are you to class me as a Nigerian when I have stated clearly that the United States of America is my Fatherland?
These are the issues.
Perhaps one day the world will begin to see reason and understand that all these rules are mere folly and propaganda; things designed by privileged people to oppress everyone else.
Till the world grows in reason, we must cancel anyone who scorns progressive views, anyone who has a problem with the freedom we are fighting for. Intolerance to ill-befitting views is the only way we can promote true tolerance. Stifling the freedom of speech of retrogressive persons is the only way we can promote freedom of choice of progressive persons. Excluding privileged people is the surest way to achieving inclusion.
No more double standards. No more hypocrisy.
Everyone ought to endeavour to do what is reasonable and right.

See, I don’t like being angry, but many things in the world always seem to collude to trigger me. And I’m not the type to keep quiet when I sniff a wisp of folly or injustice. It’s just the way I am. Horoscopically, I’m an empath and an advocate. You get?
That is why I just can’t shake off how the scheming of the Europeans opened up the Pandora’s box of catastrophes that now beset black people. Think Nigeria. Talk about slavery and colonialism and how these unholy duo usurped our culture and ruined our sociopolitical sphere.
I’m  contemplating this afresh because it trended on Twitter the other day.
Since the white people meddled with Nigeria, ourhistoryxtory has been rife with woe and doom, and several decades after independence we have only matured from bad to worse. I don’t want to hear about how Singapore and other countries have been doing very well despite being colonized. Different countries have different personalities, so don’t lump us all in the same category. That one country has strong political will does not mean another country is as fortunate.
Colonialism is the singular cause of all the problems plaguing Nigeria and Africa in general. Before colonialism, Africans had no single corrupt bone in their bodies. We were pure, righteous, and hospitable. It doesn’t matter that African chiefs sold their own into slavery for trinkets or that there were some inhumane caste systems and practices, or that there were often tribal wars. The Europeans should have just lived and let live. Our culture was perfect and beautiful, but they used their white education and religion to ensnare us. Now we are stuck in a rut. I’m not saying we are not as smart and endowed as those who have made significant progress; that’ll be totally white supremacist.
What I mean is: Because of the colonists Nigerian leaders pass policies that undermine the socioeconomic climate. Because of them our mineral resources have been mismanaged over the years. Because of them our educational sector is in shambles. Because of them snakes swallow money. Because of them I am skeptical about using products made in Nigeria. Because of them I will soon japa with my mates and continue berating them on twitter.
So let’s keep crying foul. Let’s keep pointing fingers until things change. Let’s curse the European imperialism. Let’s only focus on all the negative things the Europeans have wreaked. Let’s continue down the path of destruction so that they’ll stew in shame and regret whenever they see a Nigerian. It’s the reasonable and right thing to do.

Debate between an OBIdient and a BATist,https://punocracy.com/debate-between-an-obidient-and-a-batist/,2022-10-10T17:22:41+01:00,"Who are you voting for?
I don’t have a PVC.
Who are you rooting for?
Why would I be rooting for my next oppressor?
So would you rather have no one as president?
That’s not possible. Osinbajo said “you can’t wish this country well and vote for someone you do not believe in.”
So who would you say you believe in?
Osinbajo. Some of us really don’t care about any exactly. But the Yoruba man in me would go for BAT.
Isn’t that tribalistic?
Aunty Bimbo Adelakun once wrote: “why should I feel bad about my tribalism when that’s exactly what everyone else is also doing?”
So if you can’t beat them you join them? Is this true for every other thing for what most people do?
The cure for bigotry is bigotry. You don’t stay in your land, get attacked by intruders, and then preach peace. You pay back in the coin you’re paid. And again, there’s absolutely no evidence that the Obi presidency will be better than the BAT presidency. So why not?
Aren’t you bothered about the question marks on BAT?
Absolutely. Every reasonable person should be. His health. No well-meaning Nigerian should want a Yar’Adua repeat. His identity shrouded his mystery. His propensity for corruption and authoritarianism. Yes, it’s okay to have issues with those.
Is it OK to have those issues?
It’s okay to criticize those issues. That’s what I said. My man, Osinbaby, doesn’t have those issues. You see why I’m supporting no one now?
And yet you would rather choose such a man for than those without baggage on the ballot?
Who are those? Atiku has exactly the same issues. Or at least, most of them. He’s 78.
Sowore. Obi. Dumebi. Etc.
Oh. I was initially rooting for Osinbajo (APC) and Obi (PDP) actually. I could have voted for Obi. I just wanted (and still do) a Southern president. But the electioneering alone has made me see the ethnic dimension to politics in this country.
So where is the saying that ‘be the change you want’?
Abegiiiii. You can’t be any change you want if you’re a fry surrounded by sharks?
Okay?
Life historically was survival of the fittest. You sure know that Yorubas complained of marginalization during GEJ?
But what did OBJ’s eight year presidency do for the south west? Why hasn’t Katsina become a bastion of peace under Buhari? Aren’t those pointers that a BAT presidency won’t bring any significant difference to the south west?
Nothing. But it doesn’t matter. SW alone can lay claim to 9 years and 3/4 months of Nigerian political history. And that’s something. What did Obama 8 years do for African Americans? But they wanted it anyway.
Bragging rights and that’s all?
And I don’t even believe this. The Buhari presidency has benefitted a Katsina a lot. I mean; look at Daura. Do you know how much development flowed into Daura simply because of Buhari’s influence?
How so? Tell me. What of the insecurity there?
What of the insecurity in the southeast, even though Buhari isn’t a South Easterner? The only place in the world where there are no problems is paradise.
So that goes to show your sentiment towards your kinsmen guarantees nothing order than bragging rights.
No.
Despite the perception of northern domination, it’s still the privileged northern elites that benefit primarily. You can’t say the same of the majority. The millions of impoverished and malnourished masses suffer. You appear to be among the said elites though.
This isn’t true. Why and how did ordinary Northerners come to dominate the army, if not for the influence of their elites? Privileges can trickle down. It depends on the people. Read Max Siollun. It’s not true.
You know I’ve read all his books. In the end, wasn’t it the so-called army domination that produced Buhari, IBB, Abacha and the mythical Lantang Mafia?
Exactly. Privileges trickle down. Have you been to Kano? Kano is developed mostly by laundered money. I caught that whiff immediately I stepped into that city. Nigeria isn’t an integrated country. We need representation to keep us together.
Laundered money? And Lagos isn’t?
I love that. You can say the same thing about major Nigerian cities. Kano, Lagos, and Abuja. What’s just peculiar is that Kano is in the heart of Hausaland. So, you expect most of the assets built from laundered money in the city are owned by Hausas. It’s a city of Northerners by Northerners. Isn’t it? Things trickle down. Representation matters. And Nigeria is divided along ethnic lines.
How many Kano politicians have led the country? Compare that to Katsina.
Ehn? Jigawa State governor spends his weekends in Kano. Kano is the Lagos of the North.
So?
If you dig well. Your worldview would be shaken. The North has a lot of structural advantages in this Nigerian project.
Even more than the south? How has that not translated into economic prosperity and revenue splurge?
Yes. Land. Population. I didn’t support RUGA then, when I was closest to being an open bigot. But now as a closet one, with more knowledge, I still don’t. The South doesn’t have land. I was surprised to know today that the whole of the SE is roughly the same as Oyo State! Bro, if they want to make RUGA, they should go to Niger, Bauchi, Katsina, etc. Nowhere is the taking of ancestral land from the people it rightly belongs to allowed. Nowhere! Even America is atoning for its sins now!
Okay then. Is Buhari a failure?
Failure is objective.
To you.
He isn’t.
Okay. So Nigeria is better than before.
So the world is better than before?
Would you rather live in the world before than today’s world?
Only a fool hangs unto the past.
And the wise don’t desire a better today?
I’ve criticized Buhari a lot on two things: Insecurity and the handling of the economy. But if you dig well, neither of these problems actually started with him. And the economic problems, in some ways, aren’t his fault, at least, as best as I know. The world is in an economic crisis rn. Even in the UK, they’re shouting. Inflation dey choke them. And GEJ was an idiot. Our luckiest president in terms of oil. He squandered it.
So you think it is better to pander to ethnic sentiments to get a president that will excel where Buhari failed? Can’t you spot the irony?
What’s the irony? Even in the US, they pander to ethnic sentiments. All over the world. Even in the US, they pander to ethnic sentiments. All over the world.
That it is all over the world does that make it right? Some ultranationalists kill in the name of ethnic superiority all over the world. Does that make it right?
I’m not in support of that. But humans are primordial beings. You can’t take that away from us. Prof. Yuval Harari discussed it. Our brains are still like the brains of our ape ancestors on the plains of Africa, struggling to survive and perpetuate our genes. Do whites want to go extinct? Do blacks want to go extinct? Do Yorubas want to go extinct? Do Igbos want to go extinct? I’m not in support of killing anybody. But self-preservation is a must.
My own ancestors are not from ape sha. I just said I should quickly chip that in. Back to the matter: Will BAT do better in that regard?
This isn’t the question. The question is: will any of his opponents do better?
Yes Obi, Sowore can do better.
Evidence?
Come and see. You once sharedthis with me.
Peter Obi@Peterobioutperformed Tinubu@officialABAT(and Fashola) in all 6 major growth indicators used to assess low-middle class countries. Go and Verify!pic.twitter.com/WT35C303q8
Okay. Valid. That’s been the only reasonable thing I’ve seen OBIdients come up with. When I saw this, the only counter argument I had was that it’s a known fact that big economies tend to grow at a lower pace compared to smaller ones. And second, if the data is even true sef. You sure know what they call the Law of Diminishing Returns?
It is clear that your ethnic sentiment is shouting over your logical reason in your head. Can you hear it too?
What are the logical reasons in my head?
You can have data, but you think it has to be wrong.
No. I’m not saying it’s wrong. I got hooked by it. But I’ve valid questions. What’s the source?
OK. Open your mind still.

Your uncles and aunts are not stingy nor wicked,https://punocracy.com/your-uncles-and-aunts-are-not-stingy-nor-wicked/,2022-10-10T10:26:32+01:00,"by: Francis Ikuerowo
After you’ve finished from secondary school or graduated from a university, a college of education or even a polytechnic, even without a stable or decent source of income, you make a mistake and impregnate a girl or you get impregnated by a boy.

It’s a mistake because you forsake your brain before the coitus and refused to use a condom. It doesn’t matter if you know you’re in your fertile period as a woman. Maybe you don’t even know how to determine your safe period. It doesn’t matter, too, when you know you can take some pills to neutralize the content in you. It doesn’t matter to you as a boy to encourage the girl to take some pills to avert a looming crisis. You both simply abandon your brains and revel in the sheer recklessness of youthful exuberance.
You discover you’re pregnant while still in your parents’ house and still being fed by them. You tell the boy. He, too, is confused about what to do. Just like you, he still lives under his parents’ roof. It doesn’t matter. He’s completed his first degree, and heavily underemployed. You as the girl have also got your diploma or even first degree. And you’re still managing somewhere, perhaps as a teacher or a small-scale business owner. Both the girl’s future and yours look bleak.
This is not the time to blame each other, though.
You know you cannot resort to abortion as that’s not your last resort. Besides, it is killing, punishable by law, and your religion also forbids it. You can keep the baby. I’d rather keep the baby, you assure yourself. The boy supports your resolve, though he has no inkling how this baby would survive when it arrives.  How the future of the baby would look like.
We can manage, you both tell each other. We will support you both, your parents are solidly behind you. You have no idea how expensive child care is, and it no longer occured to both of you that you still go broke every month with your meagre salaries and how you beg friends and relatives for financial assistance. You both have even sworn not to call your uncles and aunts again because they are stingy, wicked. You know they owe you a lot for simply being uncles and aunts. So, they must act inloco parentis.
Now both of you adjust to your new reality, that of bringing up a child. Though the road is rough, you brace yourself up to face it. Your parents are still supporting you, you pray they don’t die. Your meagre salaries still enter every month, you pray you don’t get sacked. You don’t get new jobs, you can’t because child care takes more of your time and sucks you mentally, emotionally and physically.
The child starts school, you both still hold on tenaciously to your jobs. You have witnessed many hard times and maybe one day, it might get better. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. But maybe  someone has taken it before you get to that end. You don’t care to think about this.
Now your child is growing up fast, with no trust fund, no money, in his late teens, in school perhaps, and barely surviving, he now calls his father’s or mother’s brothers or sisters for financial assistance. They do not offer him help. They tell him his father and mother are still alive and should be able to take care of their child.
You both are in your late forties or early fifties. Though you’re now barely above average, you still can’t afford the best of life for your kids. He needs to depend on his uncles and aunts too for support, financial support. He doesn’t like his reality, but there’s nothing he can do about it now. To him, both of you are a failure. But he won’t tell you.
You have also got other kids, they are still very, very young but will soon get caught up in the reality of your first child.
Your first child laments his situation and wonders why you both brought him into this world with scarce resources all around him. Your child now sees his uncles and aunts as stingy, wicked, and utterly ruthless. They’re richer than my parents yet they don’t want to help me, he believes.
But his uncle and aunt were smarter then and made the right, better decisions, and refused to burden themselves with having a child and taking care of any child with little resources. They know having children is a liability because children take money away from their purse. They must work hard first to have enough assets to cover the liabilities before having a child.
Your parents didn’t know any better. They were unwise, uneducated (though literates) and are now suffering the products of their sheer recklessness.
You must tell yourself not to be like them, like your parents. Your uncles and aunts are not wicked or stingy; they have their own nuclear families, too. And they want the best for their own kids. Go and meet your parents and hold them by their necks. They’re your plights, the truly wicked ones.

"“I am here to praise Abacha, not besmirch him…”",https://punocracy.com/i-am-here-to-praise-abacha-not-besmirch-him/,2022-08-26T16:37:07+01:00,"The late Nigerian Dictator; General Sani Abacha, had incredible foresight sha. Man knew Nigeria would definitely fall on hard times thus his incredible vision to salt a few millions here and there in the abroad for rainy days. But we called him criminal, we did not see the beauty in his desecration… 😶
I am not here to besmirch Abacha, I am here to praise him. Yes, you read right, praise him. Abi how many ancestors do you know that keeps sending credit alert from the afterlife?
You thinkabourrit.
In Kofi Awoonor’s Songs of Sorrow, we have the perfect expression of disgust and disappointment at ancestors that don’t know how to answer their descendants’ prayers when he goes thus:
The Nigerian house is falling, but do you see Abacha twiddling his thumbs in the great beyond? No. Man is hustling for the continued existence of his dear Nigeria even in the afterlife, unlike a certain Rihabu who continues to fiddle whilst Nigeria burns 👀.
I mean, Just look at Abacha’s workrate na!!!
Talk of ancestor wey no dey sleep nor slumber!
How many of you did your fathers leave with an inheritance before passing on to the great beyond? Not to now talk of consistent credit alerts even from beyond the veil. 😏
There’s a saying among the Yorubas that “igbẹyin bàbà a dá”that is “the Aftermath of a person’s passing will be good” or something like that sha.
You’ll agree with me that the aftermath of Abacha’s passing has been great for Nigeria however you choose to look at it. So when I say I am here to praise Abacha, not besmirch him, even the most cynical amongst you will agree with me that Abacha; for showing the enterprising Nigerian spirit, for hustling even in the afterlife, deserves his flowers.

How can men lead sensual revolution against women’s naked oppression on social media?,https://punocracy.com/how-can-men-lead-sensual-revolution-against-womens-naked-oppression-on-social-media/,2022-08-24T12:41:44+01:00,"by: Francis Ikuerowo
When I woke up this morning, and looking down on the raving penile engine under my boxer, as readily alarmed as this engine has always been every morning, my mind travelled far and wide, and I began to nurse some thoughts. I have finally mustered some courage to write this piece to share with my fellow comrades and everybody who’d read this someday.
Looking around us on social media, especially on TikTok and Instagram, one can hardly browse past three videos without seeing a woman—even a very young girl in her teens—on tight pants that manifest the contours of their yansh and reveal the heavenly glories of their bodily design from front to back, and bras that covered their breasts scantily, showing before us men the fruits of their spirit. Many of them, who are so light-skinned, skin as radiant as crystal, do not even put on bras, jiggling the oranges right under their tight tops, as they are hell-bent on shoving this sensual desire to the untamed fellow in men’s crotch and to show us men the stuff they are made of.
This engine jerks to life every morning without being asked to, of his own volition and leeway, disturbing the serenity of our morning bliss. This engine’s waking and living through every day, rising every now and then, when we browse through social media is a great discomfort to how sexually sane our minds can be, especially the less privileged men who cannot afford the sumptuous provisions of the women’s flesh.
So, I’m thinking that what if some men, starting with you perhaps, yes I mean you that always wear Calvin Klein boxers, those tight ones and you have that long, robust rod with conspicuous girth flashing before these women’s eyes, start this revolution I’m proposing; that of celebrating your body and the great rod and six packs that you’re blessed with on social media, too. I’m sure many women wouldn’t be able to take this. A reprisal attack, calm, subtle and peaceful, against women for the grave and growing injustice we men have experienced for some years now on social media, and that which our engines have terribly suffered in their hands.
It takes just a single man, or a crop of them, to start this revolution. And no, it can’t start with me. I’ve got elders whose engines are way bigger than mine and who have the unfettered leeway to do as they like on social media. I can only write and write — writing is my own tool — to encourage some of my comrades in this world of ours to follow suit as long as they have no value and relevance outside nudity and the others to better hold the fort and protect their personal brand till Christ comes back.
Whether you who are reading this piece start this revolution now or not, I know this revolution is going to happen someday when some men can no longer take it anymore. When this revolution eventually materializes, men and women of all faiths are going to witness the social media kingdom of Sodom and Gomorrah; a sensuous kingdom of freewill and intense sexual desire where loose men and women roam over the internet and social media with no tangible or concrete value asides their flaunting the inanities of their bodies to the sensual gratifications of every viewer.Unlike Sodom and Gomorrah, nobody’s going to save us, unless the internet is shut down. But I’m hell sure the capitalists wouldn’t do that. Oh, what a bitter-sweet world that will be! A world where nudity reigns supreme!

I admit at this point, it’s low hanging fruit but I’m sure everyone has heard about theoh-so beautiful posta ‘relationship expert’ wrote to his fiancee (and the whole world). Now, you might be thinking ”Urgh! People should stop talking about it already!’and to that, I’d say I’m not talking about it, I’m only making a blog post about it, so…
A quick recap for those who have heard about it and those who haven’t, there was this guy who wrote a very beautiful love post about his fiancee and started it with what every woman on Earth wants to hear at least once in her lifetime ”You’re not the most beautiful woman on Earth; neither are you the most intelligent woman, but like I’ve never chosen to find perfection in anyone else…”
Preach brother! Preach!
Many people got outraged at the whole post for this part in particular, and I wonder why. Is it because the whole post had a haughty and demeaning undertone (and overtone) about it? Because he goes on to defend his reasoning all the while being a ‘relationship expert’?
Obviously that cannot be it.
I personally admire his amazing grammatical accuracy. Did you see that semi-colon right after you’re not beautiful? Perfect. I don’t even know how to properly use a semi-colon to this day.
My brother in spirit went on to say“…Stating that you’re not the beautiful/intelligent might sound like it’s not a compliment, yeah?…”
Of course not. How can pointing out someone’s deficiencies on such a grand scale and to such a large amount of people sound like its not a compliment?
“…But it’s a realistic base for real love. Acknowledging my woman isn’t the best, but I’m not looking for the best. I was looking for you and I found you…’”
How touching!
He wasn’t looking for the best, you know, some people go into relationships with their respective partners because they believe they have found the best person who completes them, but not him. He was looking for her, the not-best, which makes me applaud his amazing prophetic skills because before they even met he already knew and was in search for her.
“…this to me is real love. Not the one that consoles itself in the faux reality that their partner is the most good-looking, most intelligent, most successful person in the world. That’s disingenuous and doesn’t give room for love to thrive…”
Other people lie when they tell their significant other they are most beautiful person to them (or in the whole world) but he comes right out and says it to his partner that they aren’t.
I love this vibe he’s giving just like he loves her. Set the boundaries, clear the air because by chance, she might think that in all of the 3 billion plus women in the world, she is the most beautiful or the most intelligent and we can’t have that.
Of course, any man who tells his significant other that she is the most beautiful woman he has ever laid eyes upon is a cheating, lying, manipulative bastard that needs to be behind bars for committing such a horrible crime. That’s not true love, because it doesn’t grow in such a rigid situation where you compliment one another. You have to come online and say to the whole world that your partner is neither smart nor beautiful. That, lovelies, is true love.
All in all, this is the summary on it and I definitely reported it as unbiased as I can. No judgement, at all.
I think this is the point where I would state that to each his own, and as long as the fiancee doesn’t have a problem with it, why should I? So let’s assume I said that.

"Hypocrisies, Dance and TikTok",https://punocracy.com/hypocrisies-dance-and-tiktok/,2022-08-15T14:48:54+01:00,"by: Happy Hour
I come from a prejudiced standpoint on this issue and I can confirm that I use TikTok frequently; and my brain and has begun to physically rotten. When you come close to me and you say“oof, what’s that smell?”, it’s not the cheap awful perfume I bought and stubbornly decided to keep using until I finish my money, it’s the smell of my brain actively decomposing from too much consumption of videos on TikTok.
I don’t know why everyone seems so set against being known to be users of the app but TikTok is the most used social media app currently, and those users aren’t coming from the bush. So Tunde, when you say you say the app is trash and that you’d only be caught dead watching it, are you sure you are not a soul engaging in stealth – an hypocrite of the same ideals you embody?
This exhibition of hypocrisy reminds me of when popular influencer on the app, Kelly, was trending, the thousands of Nigerian followers she got weren’t from the middle of the pacific ocean, were they?
Then there are those who feel like it is a medal-worthy achievement not being on TikTok, the pride they exhibit in conveying this ‘achievement’ and the judgement in their tone when you inform them that you are a user of the platform, just makes me cringe at the shameless show of self-righteousness, silently screaming in reply “come off the high horse!”
“You don’t use the app; so what, Ade? I should go and jump off third mainland bridge?”
Some even go as far as giving you unsolicited opinions as to why they’ll never use such a time-wasting app where all people do is to dance and shake their bum.
It’ll come as surprise to most of them that the reason they keep seeing people shaking their God-given endowments is because they like people flaunting their assets. Literally. The kind of videos you like determine the kind of videos you keep seeing. That is how the algorithms work.
The funniest thing of all is most of these people who judge so much are frequent users of Twitter which, as much as they try to dignify, is a toxic wasteland where optimism goes to die; and hate, bias and judgement thrives, but then again I am prejudiced to see anyone using an app I’m not using as a non-productive time-waster.
All in all, it’s an intricate song and dance of who is the most ‘mature’ and an elaborate, ironic game of the pot calling the kettle black.

"2023 election: By design, all of us will make money",https://punocracy.com/2023-election-by-design-all-of-us-will-make-money/,2022-07-18T11:51:34+01:00,"by: Quadri Yahya
At first, these periods served as a baller period for delegates during the primaries of political parties in the country. I missed that opportunity because I was not ripe enough to rip the fruit of my labour in politics. I was still acting like the good guy that prioritized the interest of the people. I wanted to vote for a good aspirant to contend in any election. Meanwhile, it was but a lie as one hungry but honest man’s vote can’t prevail over the other pocketed delegates. Hence, it is now a game of chop-make-I-chop.
Politics in the country takes a new dimension – at least the poverty rate will reach 95 million in 2022 according to the World Bank. And as the flavour, sugar and ice of the national cake drool downward, it’s smart to lick sharply. That was what happened when delegates collected their share of the cake, and one thing is certain, all of us will make money. At some political parties’ national conventions, the movies are memorable.
Just before knocking off the thought that corruption now walks from one street to another and from door to door, the Ekiti election was quite impressive – one man, one vote and some token to buy foodstuffs in lieu of the unsurprising poverty rate. No blame for the electorates who had etched it in their mind that such an opportunity comes once in four years: if I was there, I couldn’t imagine myself pocketing my conscience to fill my purse.
We heard that there was a door-to-door campaign. Hence, this proverb translation comes to mind: money is the bicycle of evangelism.
Understanding that it is not a total truth that most of our leaders are corn persons who will go to any farm to pluck from the stalk, however, the lie is that they’re too dishonest to be docile to the law when the people come to the ballot with open palms like beggars.
It is on this backdrop that I will give you a takeaway – take it dearly as it will be useful in the forthcoming 2023 election.
Everybody interested in making cool cash should join politics ASAP as the presidential election approaches where the kingmaker, the articulate, and the obedient among others will be doling out cash. Our votes belong to the highest bidder as we live in mystery in the country."
Being an exceptional parent: An instructional guide,https://punocracy.com/being-an-exceptional-parent-an-instructional-guide/,2022-07-18T11:41:06+01:00,"by: Chiemeziem Everest Udochukwu
This brief guide is divided into two sections for fathers and mothers, but we trust it to yield wonderful and sustainable results, even when swapped.
Section 1
Your sons are the true continuing links of your bloodline, so draw closer to them. Encourage your woman to be closer to her daughters. This may seem trivial, but whilst you buy your sons car toys and video games, buy your daughters teddy bears with braided hair so they’d play-nurse them; this prelude to motherhood prepares them for the inevitable, especially psychologically.
Practicalize before your sons what it means to be men. Question their mother why she alighted from a private car when the house is beside a bus stop. Demand who bought the new chandelier earrings that rarely leave her ears of late. Stay a week on an unannounced business trip. Return and question her why she wasn’t home at the time you returned. If her reply is unremorseful or unsatisfactory or unnecessarily talkative, punish her but not to death. A single kick or slap is enough to show you’re in charge. Just ensure the kick or slap is heavy enough to make her sob and beg you and serve better dinner.
In their adolescence, tell them no arts or education courses. It is either the sciences, law, engineering or they become handymen and sponsor themselves. Encourage them to learn coding and programming and leave catering and fashion to their sisters. If one of them talks or walks or sounds or behaves like his sister, the spirit of homo is circling your house. Be thankful you discovered early; you fathered a son, not asoughter. Call him to order, but if he insists, withdraw his sonship license and watch him self-correct. If this fails, up the ante: dip him in boiling water and kill his impurities.
Remind the normal ones that money fulfills men as husbands fulfil women. Share with them the juicy advantages of you being 10 years older than their mother. They’ll learn and won’t look at women older than them, especially ones above 30 who have dry vulvas and lower possibilities of childbirth. Remind them why you didn’t marry Dr. Ann; she was proud. Established women are proud.
Finally, if they return to you broken, vent that they aren’t the true sons of their father.
Section 2
Start from the roots. Remind your daughters that the greatest gift you handed their father was your virginity and that gave you the edge over the other highly skilled women in his life. Each day, before you pull them all into the kitchen, or scatter them across the house with mops, warn the boys to return from the football field early so their food won’t get cold. Make the girls understand it is the duty to do domestic chores. They could act stubborn. If they do, whether in the throes of frustration or perceived partiality, remind them they won’t last long in their husband’s houses with such rebellious behavior.
Like their father does not teach his sons, do not teach them about condoms or attractions, but the rule of thumb that just the tip leads to pregnancy. With Mummy GO’s absoluteness, etch it on their consciousness that little or no makeups, longer skirts and thicker tops will not only accelerate their heavenly race but retard the steps of rapists and sexual offenders towards them. Cleavage and thighs attract men like excreta attracts flies. They will have themselves to blame if when this happens.
Warn them to beware of politics and feminists. The former is for women who don’t have time for their homes. The latter are lesbians or misandrists or then choosy but now distraught women unable to find men to pluck them out of shame. In contrast to the timelessness of their brothers, remind them breasts sag and faces wrinkle and menopause is real so they’d know they are depreciable fruits that prompt quick harvest or face drying up, uneaten. Show them the scars on your body and remind them marital long-suffering is the hallmark of virtuous women.
Remind them that men are polygamous in nature and could bring one or two extra-marital mistakes home for correction. Tell the story of your stubborn sister who lost her husband to a side chick because she decided to fight and not allow God to judge.
Enjoin them to pass the legacy to their children, and when they come back to you chucked, leached and pale and helpless like exploited yokels, shake your head and tell them you are disappointed in them.

How to be an Okowa,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-an-okowa/,2022-06-29T11:23:16+01:00,"by: Kayode-Dada Ifeoluwa Lois
The world of politics births one entertaining act after another. In recent times, a certain hat-trick has been played right before our eyes by another uncommon governor. Nigerian politics is a breeding ground for various acts, hence such acts as the Tambuwal, the Akpabio, the Tinubu and more recently the “Okowa” are not new plays on the ever puzzling stage of politics.
The mystery of this hat-trick is still being analyzed, and in the interest of any career driven individual, this author has decided to give an authentic breakdown of the “Okowa” showdown. One thing about an “Okowa” is that they always win (if winning above all else is your thing, read carefully in between the lines). The “Okowa” act guarantees success in every field so we will love to share a step-by-step procedure that ensures you sink your claws in your goals (ticket).
STEP 1: Define your goal
This step is crucial as it will direct all your plans and actions. It is noteworthy that you shouldn’t be vague – properly articulate your goal. For instance, if you want to be the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, you must recite it in the mirror everyday so you can work towards it. Remember,an Okowa no dey carry last, nor third nor second.
STEP 2: Identify others that nurse the same ambition
This step is even more crucial than the former, as it is the compass that leads you to victory. Now picking out all people who have a certain interest or ambition can be quite tedious–this is where a joint cause comes in.
Find a suitable umbrella that is focused on championing a cause, join them. This step is particularly tricky because you have to ensure all your countrymen (opponents) are also under that umbrella, enter step 3.
STEP 3: Host a conference in your state to show your unwavering support
It is very necessary to have all opponents under that umbrella without stirring up suspicion. This is why you must organize a splendid, warm and welcoming conference in your home state (what better way to show honesty, than to throw a nice party?). Afterwards, pledge your undying, unfading, unwavering and unrelenting support for that cause.
STEP 4: Betray everybody!
Where there is a plan, there must be a better plan, and as an “Okow,a” you must always be the custodian of that better plan. Liaise with other stakeholders, secure your ticket and betray everybody. You don’t owe anyone anything. They all shouldn’t hate the player, but rather, hate the game (you are just an exceptional player, you no killpesin pikin).
STEP 5: Deny everything
You cannot be seen as dishonest for betrayal in politics – you are just trying to move forward in life. An “Okowa” must vehemently deny any accusation, however so blatant. Lie! Lie your way out of everything (wetin concern you, you have achieved your aim).
STEP 6: Beg for forgiveness
Being the godly “Okowa” that you are, you are a peace keeper. After denying and shutting down allegations, do make sure, you also beg your country men and explain to them that you were just trying to feed your family (nothing spoil o, ti yin oni baje o).
Remember, as a thinker in the Okowa school of thought, nothing must stop you from achieving your goal. Once you are successful, drive down to Asaba to drop a bag of kolanuts for your able mentor.

Clarifying gender balance: How to celebrate the men in your life,https://punocracy.com/clarifying-gender-balance-how-to-celebrate-the-men-in-your-life/,2022-06-23T09:58:04+01:00,"by: Mustapha Lawal
To get right to the point, it is past time to set aside the discussion or struggle, or whatever it is called between men and women about equality, equalisation, compensation, or anything. I despise watching women suffer unjustly and needlessly under the pretext of being the lesser sex.
Being called the weaker sex is very bad, but accepting the notion that“I am a woman, and vulnerable, so I need to be considered in so many ways, give me what I deserve (or what I do not deserve), not on the account of ability or merit, but on the account that I am a woman,”is the worst notion ever.
The world is unfair to women, no doubt. We all know that at least. It was International Women’s Day some months ago, and in the same month, we had Mothering Sunday, another holiday to celebrate these beautiful creatures during the Women’s Day, Mother’s Day, Mothering Sunday, Day of the Girl Child e.t.c. Such injustice!
Anyway, it is beautiful to see that in celebration of these wonderful creatures, the street of social media was lit full of engagement and properly filtered images of this great being. Awesome stuff, as we should break the biases, because it is so unfair to see so many takes and thoughts on the lives of these creatures when it seems as though everyone has liberty.
Oh, liberty I said – I meant otherwise, because we all must have forgotten what that means. Thanks to the human rights privileges we have enjoyed till this moment and social media for doing the Lord’s work in protecting our dignity as humans and even women.
Anyways, even though we all agree that a day is not enough to celebrate these powerful creatures, we at least all honoured the day and celebrated them in full gleam, advocating for better representation, showering gratitude and praises for their role and those are all beautiful to see.
But, you know, boys are stones. Men are scum. To be a male is to be strong and never a prey. So we can all agree that whatever role (as a father, brother, son or husband), the male gender play is almost unimportant and can be easily replaced. What a man can do, a woman can do better, innit? Isn’t it that men are always guilty, so why should we hear a side of their story?
I don’t know what I was searching for on the web that got me the result of international days for men. So really? Does such thing exist or was just created, does that even matters? But who on earth told the men that they can be celebrated too? Why do they have to be celebrated when they have nine lives and have never used one to make this one world a better place.
Anyways, regardless of who brought about that, we should celebrate it and as per your unpaid and unsolicited adviser that I am, here are some suggestions to help us celebrate our men nicely on the international days created for them too.
Firstly, we’ve all agreed celebrations are meant for reflection.
What is the importance of any celebration you have without reflecting on the important things that have happened?
So, my dear, don’t forget to remind all men in your life of their ills and wrongs, which enhances deep reflection more than anything else. Yes, remind them that men are scum, that they are the sole contributors to every menace going on in society, and that they’re too demanding, despite doing nothing to be responsible. Remind them, preach it to them and help them reflect better
What a man can do, a woman can do better.
It began with, what a man can do, a woman can try, then it became, what a man can do, a woman can do as well. Then, what a man can do a woman can do even better. Now it is, what a man can do, a woman can overdo. Why turn everything into a war of words? Why can men accept things and just admit women are superior beings? Is that too much of a price to pay for the peace, sanity and better of the world?
So instead of praising men for whatever good they must’ve done before, kindly highlight to them, several women that must have done more in different situations on the international men’s day. Thank the women for shouldering all the men’s responsibility in your life, since they did that anyway and men can do no good when women are doing better.
And you men, I heard you started raising objections to the simple fact that you are a stone. How dare you?! Have you ever seen a stone shout, throw tantrums, or even shed any tears, no matter how it is rolled, thrown or being hit by anything? You are the man! And you shall never be emotional, rather you shall shoulder the struggles of the world on your back with no complaints.
While I wish you are treated better and given an equal chance at leading a balanced life too, the fear of being mobbed or dragged like a faulty tiger generator will not even allow me to speak up, because who am I? Who am I in the face of all the amazing humans who never see human beings beyond gender roles? Who believes gender is the ultimate disparity of successful living? Maybe we can do better and live as humans, far away from all these gender biases in the name of equality. Anyhoo, Happy International (Wo)men’s Day, everyday.

The judgement of this court? We need more guns,https://punocracy.com/the-judgement-of-this-court-we-need-more-guns/,2022-06-20T11:26:10+01:00,"by: Ibrahim Maryam
In my own opinion, the “anywayness” of the Nigerian government can be interpreted simply as “the ability of the government to provide a long term destructive plan guised as an empowering solution to the people, whenever they are confronted with a problem that is of their own making”.
The astronomical increase in mass killings, terrorism and the equivalent high rate of insecurity in the country has sparked up conversations on whether citizens being allowed access to their own personal ammunition would reduce the rate of insecurity and killings. Our leaders had very interesting opinions about this, with Governor Ortom coming out to clearly state “we need more guns”.
I think it is fair enough for our leaders who would most likely not be kidnapped or shot at on the streets by “unidentifiable” men in military wear, to make suggestions on self defence. I mean, however can you explain the 1000 AK47s and 4 million bullets that were discovered in the former governor’s office; he was obviously so fearful and concerned for his own personal safety and he needed protection – what a trailblazer! The officials’ push to legalize gun ownership is in no way an acknowledgement of their failure and their readiness to not be better in the future, but is rather an acknowledgement that they stand by and support the citizens and understand that the power should belong to the people.
Nigeria failed at refining its own oil, so our public office holders do it for us. Nigeria has failed in the education sector, so our public office holders own schools that provide standard education. Nigeria has failed at providing security, so our politicians can equally handle that for us. They definitely won’t be profiting off the poor, who would be buying the guns anyway – when have they ever?
Governor Ortom, having carefully studied the country made the suggestion while using USA as a case study, have understood this. Research showed that most people in America die by their own guns used against them, but the governor understands Nigerians, for he understands that we are more grounded and definitely smarter compared to Americans, we would never misuse the ammunition we procure, our forefathers had hunting guns in their homes anyways and they still lived peacefully, it’s a genetic thing.
There is this overused Gandhi quote; “be the change you want”, and that is all we need in Nigeria. We wanted safer water supply, so we dug our own boreholes, we wanted good light, so we buy our own generators, so when you want security, you buy your own guns.
The judgement of this court? “We need more guns!”

Finding Nigerian Solutions to Air Pollution,https://punocracy.com/finding-nigerian-solutions-to-air-pollution/,2022-06-20T11:09:12+01:00,"by: Oshodi Boluwatife Treasure
My name is Soluyi Shanawole. This article would be containing my 100% efficient and scalable solution to air pollution all over the world. Read and breathe in fresh air whilst not erring in my perspective(s) on this matter.
Do you ever wonder if Earth had no pollution at all? I think about that all the time. If Earth really had no pollution, the world would be a better place. In my own little understanding, air pollution is when harmful particles saturate the atmosphere just enough to cause harm to us and our surroundings. One very obvious example is the issue of global warming. Yes! Global warming [now, you know!]. A larger percentage of the health and environmental problems we face in our society is as a result of global warming.
From burning of carbon fuels to emissions in factories, to even our hair sprays – yes, they contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which contaminate the air we breathe indoors; likewise other sprays including room and pesticides sprays. Don’t even get me started on smoking! It’s one of the major contributors to air pollution all around the world. Did you know that the air pollution emitted by cigarettes is 10 times greater than a diesel car exhaust? [now, you know!]
Now that we have established some of the causes of air pollution in our environment, let me share some of my thoughts on how we could reverse the harmful effects of the air pollution in our society and hopefully, the world realises its significance and adopt these measures.
First of all, we should consider a cleaner mode of transportation:piggyback riding!Our fathers, uncles, elder brothers, heck, even our mothers carried us on their backs at one time or the other without contributing to the pollution of the atmosphere (except maybe any of them forgets to brush their teeth and gets out of breath while piggyback riding). We could also improvise with boats on roads instead of gasoline vehicles that cough to death in varying shades of grey from their behinds; despite the number of grades their fuels attended. At worst, we burn down all the cars once and for all!
Secondly, wecease all production–shut down the factoriesandkill all of the workersto annihilate any form of resistance to these reforms! (we’ve seen how it all plays out in the movies). Plus, we stop wearing clothes and live out our days unclad as we bask in the glory of the morning breeze, summer sun and winter storms – enjoying Mother Nature’s goodness year in, year out!
Researchers also claim that farting in front of a lover makes a lady more human, which fosters empathy and enhances their relationship. This also implies that no one is holding back or hiding their true self to their partner. Farting is a natural bodily activity, similar to laughing, weeping, or eating, when you think about it. Just imagine inhaling the flatulence of your loved one(s) instead of the lung-suffering fumes that come from the burning of carbon.
fuels. Family bonds would grow stronger and divorce cases would drop drastically! Isn’t that a wonderful thing? No more broken homes and societal ills as a result!
Imagine a better world without air pollution. Everyone indeed has a role to play in making the world a better place! I hope that I have been able to convince you and not to confuse you on the necessary steps to be made so as to restore clean air back to the environment and our entire ecosystem.

My candidate is better than yours,https://punocracy.com/my-candidate-is-better-than-yours/,2022-06-19T17:42:44+01:00,"by: Alex Omenye
Who is your candidate for the 2023 Presidential elections? Who will you vote for in the polls to determine if Nigerians love their chains or freedom? Who is your candidate, and what’s his policy for the development of Nigeria?
I have chosen my candidate, and he has already said he will send us to Mars to Neflix and chill small because we have suffered enough for eight years. My incoming GCFR has us in his thoughts. He understands that we have suffered enough and deserve rest before he officially takes over. A man of the people already.
What has your candidate promised to do? A candidate said he would recruit the youths into the army, train them to fight North Korea and then feed them with yam, and cassava. Is that candidate your candidate? Please tell him that it won’t be necessary because my candidate said the yahoo boys would be trained to become tech bros who will turn produce robots that will fight WWIII when the need arises. Your candidate isn’t in touch with the emerging realities of the world. He was still stuck in 1984. My candidate is truly the man for this Presidency. On his mandate l stand. You should leave your candidate and join mine abi you want to be eating cassava every day in the Barracks?
What will your candidate do to tackle the poor economy? My candidate is an Oxford and Harvard-trained economist. We will print more money and share it with the poor people; that way, people will have cash and not die from poverty. To reduce the Naira rates against the dollar, he said he would use police dogs to chase Bureau De Change operators who exchange the Naira for the Dollar in a high rate. Those Bureau De Change that doesn’t hear word will say and hear pepper andshegefrom the hand of the GCFR. E go shock them. Don’t forget he will shut down websites like AbokiFX that will make the administration look bad.
My candidate has stated that he will extraordinarily fight corruption. The ruling party is a party of saints. Sainthood is one of the characteristics of the ruling party. Even if you looted your state or the agency you’re inc lharge of dry, once you join the ruling party, you will be forgiven. To err is human, to forgive is divine. If you mistakenly get jailed before joining the ruling party, in the next state pardon, you will be pardoned. Go and sin no more. My candidate is the best for Nigeria. The one who has a human heart and not the one who will use EFCC and ICPC to prosecute looters. What is the essence of charging them when governance na turn by turn. Forgive them because if e get to your turn, you go loot too.
What is your candidate going to do about the seasonal ASUU strike? Tell me what your candidate will do about the yearly love lost that ASUU and FG exhibit yearly? ASUU is a nuisance. They can go on strike as long as they like, and when they’re tired, they will resume. My candidate’s children are not in public universities, wetin concern am with the strikes?
My candidate will do a lot. To make the citizens happy, the Presidency will host parties every month. Your elected officials will be representing you at those parties and dinners. You can watch them live at NTA. What more will the one God sent to us do to make the Nigerians that elected him happy?
My candidate came from humble beginnings. He struggled very hard to get to the top, and as such l trust him so much that l know he won’t steal public funds. He is a billionaire. What does he need public funds for? Nothing. We should be grateful for a candidate like my candidate. He is doing us a favour. We should be grateful and not be ingrates.
For the other policies that my candidate will introduce that l didn’t state in this article, l intentionally did it. I want my candidate to be shocking and choking those who don’t believe in him. Anticipate my candidate dears. He is the man for you and l.
My candidate is better than yours. Don’t battle with a man that has a divine mandate, or you will end up in disgrace.
May affliction never rise the second time.

How to be the perfect husband to your woman (HUS 101),https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-the-perfect-husband-to-your-woman-hus-101/,2022-06-04T12:17:55+01:00,"by: Maryam Lawal
This article is for men who are married or are intending husbands, for men who aspire to be baby daddies only, please take your chair elsewhere,tainkyu.
It is worrisome that our society does very little to instill “marriageability” values in the male folks and this invariably affects the success and longevity of the marriages contracted  nowadays. As a man who will someday get married, you must understand that there are certain tricks that will help your marriage sail through trying storms. It is not enough that you feel that you are financially or emotionally ready or that you desire occasional head rubs and all the shenanigans that comes with marriage, No!. There is so much more to being an husband, much much more to being an excellent husband. Take your jotter and your pen and sit with me through this lecture.
One trick to sustaining your marriage is that you must understand the composite elements of your woman. You must understand that women are fickle beings generally and as such, you must be at the top of all your games always. I will discuss these in the succeeding paragraphs.
First off, a good husband must be proficient at cooking excellent meals that will continually whet his woman’s appetite for him. Don’t forget what I said earlier; women are fickle beings generally and as such, all it takes for your woman to be snatched away from you is a plate of sumptuous meal home cooked by a man like you. As trivial or as insignificant as this may sound, the inability of men to cook good meals according to research, is one of the leading causes of infidelity and divorce in marriages — don’t ask me for the statistics, the internet is there for everybody. A woman who is well fed, respected and loved will ignore all the catcalls she gets outside, or you think it is only you that have eyes for good things?
A good woman is hard to come by these days and if you are fortunate to secure one for yourself, you must thank your stars and guard your treasure jealously. You see, the devil will try to scatter your home but you must never allow him! You must standgidigbaagainst those sons of Jezebel who will stop at nothing to destroy your union. If you lose your wife to one of those tooth-pick legged men with great culinary skills out there because of your own poor cooking abilities, the shame is yours till eternity. You cannot cook ordinaryegusisoup and you are saving up to pay bride price,Hellooo brother Kunle, whose daughter do you plan to mistreat?
Another thing that you should take note of is that you must learn how to be extremely patient with your woman. You must block out your emotional side to whatever hurt she causes you because what is a marriage without trials and tribulations, only a wise man will know how to put the situation under control. You must learn how to pacify your woman with words and actions. Your wife is brimming with anger and you are returning the same energy?, that is counterproductive, you must never do such. A good husband must know that in every home, one party will be theewureby default while the other party should be theaguntanby common sense. It will be impossible if both parties are strong headed, it is only logical that the husband acts “the docile sheep” part for peace to reign in their home, be the bigger person —after all ,you all claim that no woman’s creation is without blemish —so Mr Perfect sir, kindly use your perfectly created self and wisdom to accommodate your woman’s seeming excesses.
Women will always be  women, like our forefathers used to say. It is up to you as a man to devise clever schemes to tame your own wife, to win her heart irrevocably, however difficult, long and tedious the process may be. You must learn how to adjust to their flaws and their shortcomings because it is innate (I doubt if they are capable of self control). To enjoy the fruits of your marriage, you must put up with their excesses and emotional torture (may include a touch of infidelity too, who knows). You must do all these with unreserved patience, hope and faith in God that one day they will change. For the sake of your children, you mustn’t allow your wife’s excesses to disrupt the continuance of your marriage. Rather, you should channel your energy into raising your children appropriately because they are the reward for all your pain and suffering in the marriage and when they are all grown up and able, God’s willing, you will reap immense benefits from them to make up for all the past years of your endurance in your unhappy marriage.
All your tears and worry would no longer matter when you areeating the yamof your children (roast, boiled, fried- anyhow it is cooked), that should be the ultimate goal. Leave your wife to frolic around, there’s very little that a man can do when women wants to behave however they like, rather pray to God to touch her heart and return her to you. You see, that is what virtuous men do, the virtuous men of the Days of Old and it pays off one hundred percent, trust me. It is just sad that many of the men nowadays are not patient, they lack those beautiful values that our forefathers possessed which paid off for them. Woke culture will destroy things.
In conclusion, a beautiful  marriage is to be coveted and should strive towards by every right thinking man, if not for anything, at least for your kids and for your reputation. It is shameful and is a huge dent on your name as a man, if you are unable to hold the pillars of your marriage together, a common marriage! It behoves on you as the man of the house to ensure that there are no loose bolts and nuts or cracks in the walls of your marriage and even if there are, you must cover them up, endure and pray them away. Masculinity these days, has gone far beyond the test of physical strength, it is now largely hinged on your ability to keep your family together in the face of tribulations, there is no excuse to allow for a divorce or separation because it is a shameful tag, who will marry a divorced man? In this age where divorce cases are rife, it is enviable to see strong marriages waxing even stronger, what makes you think that you cannot have such too? I will leave you, dear husbands and husbands to be, to a very sound adage of our forefathers which is instructive in this respect. It is translated loosely from Yoruba as;Patience is never too much, unless it wouldn’t even be enough.I hope and pray that you are imbued with unrelenting patience so that you can enjoy the fruits of your marriage. Amin.
No, no, it is nothing actually. Yeah, you are welcome.

Portraits of an unknown gunman,https://punocracy.com/portraits-of-an-unknown-gunman/,2022-06-02T07:45:23+01:00,"by: Ifeoluwa Kayode-Dada
A run-down of reasons why our country, Nigeria, is one of the greatest nations to ever exist must include our impeccable military and defense system. Our soldiers are ever on the frontlines; contending against high-tech, super weapon, gun-wielding robots, popularly known as “unknown gunmen”.
Our top-notch defense system deserves its accolades for its the tedious efforts to contain the dangerous invasion in the form of these “unknown gunmen,” which is indeed laudable. This maybe why, albeit contrasting, at present, there has been little to no success in bringing these perpetrators to book.
Our in-house detective (also a detective unknown) has, in search of the identity of these men, ran through the jungle, walked through the Sahara, searched trees and combed through forests to gather Intel on this situation and it behoves upon us, the citizen with no military training except the NYSC camp drills, to lend the our dear military a helping hand.
We will take you on a long revealing journey, painting the faces of these men with our delicate brush strokes and intricate details.
1 –Brush stroke one (the unknown men’s faces): Their faces are like any other, except that their cheeks are fuller (because they have been relatively undisturbed by the rugged military experience). In the event of actual effort being made to capture these men, the military should please note the cheeks. It is their identity badges.
2 –Brush stroke two (the unknown man’s hands): Contrasting to their pretty cheeks, the enemy hands are slightly tougher. Why? Because they are very skilled in martial arts (Kung Fu). The grandiose, over-exaggerated trainings of our armed forces couldn’t possibly withstand this martial arts training. This adds to the mystery of their unknown status. So, beware of that impromptu and unexpected hand-flip in the face or stomach, dear military men.
3 –Brush stroke three (the unknown men’s legs): Their legs, although like any other, have super speed (like sonic, the hedgehog). This is why, they are never caught by our superior forces. They are not trained to deal with such matters, and this fact also explains their status of their unknown personalities (imagine trying to catch a bad guy that runs a million kilometers per minute,you fit catch am?)
4-Brush stroke four (the unknown man’s guns): Obviously, a distinguishing factor of an unknown gunman is the “gun” itself. Nigeria is a relatively safe place, so guns are not easily accessible, therefore establishing the uniqueness of this “unknown gunman’s threat”. Our very own Detective unknown’s findings show that these men use high-tech weapons from the future (Yes, could you even believe that these guys may be time travellers?)
These are reasons why, till date, they are all still at large; though many lives have been lost to them at different times throughout the federation. So, when you hear the words “unknown gunmen” from the telly, you sure now know what is at stake.

"No breathing space for you, home or abroad",https://punocracy.com/no-breathing-space-for-you-home-or-abroad/,2022-06-01T11:49:39+01:00,"by: Rahma O. Jimoh
I know you have been wondering and wandering for a greener land that you can call home. Do not expect this piece to show you the way home – Rasaq Malik already told us “there’s no home in this land”. Hence, this letter is not to lead you home but to teach you how to live in comfort in a home you can’t call home.
Home
“You are required to constantly remember that even as you live at home, on our black soil, you are still not safe from tribalism, religionism, and maybe not racism, because they are all discrimination.”
The sight of melanin disturbs people. You need to learn to amble around like a second class citizen of the world. Our role models like HushPuppy and Abba Kyari already proved our criminality and beautified our imagery. They have helped with our matter. Don’t forget they are our mentors —our honourable representatives, at home and abroad. They are only doing their jobs.
Every young rich Nigerian is a Yahoo boy. Yes! They are our mentors too. Do not also forget that in Nigeria “Ole ni everybody, Yahoo ni gbogbo wa.” Our musicians have sung this countless times to our eardrums and ourpolitricksters. Think about how they constantly save our resources, how they preserve them in the cold soils abroad just so we don’t go hungry in the future. We can instead keep living on an empty stomach,s for now, it’s all for the future.
I know you sincerely feel for your brothers and sisters abroad but you need to realize that you live in a similar state at home which you probably caused. Remember, you voted for the tricksters for two cups of rice. You refused to buy goods made in Nigeria. You hardly even support your fellow brothers and sisters. Maybe charity doesn’t begin at home anymore. You need to believe in yourself before the world is compelled to reckon with you. Another election is close by and have the presidential aspirants not said enough?
Another important thing is, anytime you qualify for a contract abroad and it was nullified based on our well-painted image, don’t be pained. The image didn’t create itself. You know your future is bright and you’re the leader of tomorrow. We can all see our government striving hard for the morrow. They are investing our resources for the future. Hence, till the mysterious future, be a good child else you’ll become another HushPuppy.
Abroad
Black is the colour of crimes, hence you’re always guilty by default.
To our brothers & sisters whom sheer fortune has taken abroad. If you ever find yourself losing a deserved opportunity because blacks are criminals andYahoo ni gbogbo wa. then you should shut up and move on. You need to always remember that you’re a second class citizen in the world. You have to develop the art of contentment— the mentality of our people.
An important one is that you should be careful of places you go to. Some places are not meant for black-skinned guys and some houses cannot be for you, same as some jobs and schools too. How will you go to another person’s land and nowgoanbe kinging? Do you want another wee twitter space on how Nigerians are stealing black Americans’ jobs? Hence, be careful or you’d end up being unable to breathe.
Another thing you must note if you wear black skin is this—when you see a cop, merely disappear. Don’t run! I repeat, don’t run. You’re a criminal, remember? Black is the colour of crimes and all blacks are criminals. Hence don’t run, simply disappear. It does not matter that you are innocent or that your documents are complete. It does not matter that you were not drinking, smoking or driving too fast. What matters is you’re black and there’s no breathing space for you, especially in a white man’s land. You may be born there, you may hail from Chicago but all that doesn’t matter. You’re a second class citizen of the world and that is what matters. In one word, you’re a weed, only waiting to be uprooted.

Navigating Nigerian parenting 101,https://punocracy.com/navigating-nigerian-patenting-101/,2022-05-10T15:54:42+01:00,"by: Ifeoluwa Kayode-Dada
“Rebecca, if a boy uses his hand to touch you, you will get pregnant” Mama Rebecca says, as she gives Rebecca, one of many insightful talks on sex education.
Nigeria is a very complicated country and this trickles down into various aspects of our culture, parenting inclusive. A parent should be a watchful guide over his/her child who seeks to grow the child into the best he/she can be. In Nigeria, a parent is a delightful solider who seeks to bend, twist and break a child into the future leader he/she is to be.
The general idea is that children are kids (no, I mean literal goats); they need to be traumatized into giving up the stubbornness and idiocy brought with them from birth. The approach to parenting in Nigeria involves molding one’s child into society’s approved standard of behavior regardless of what thekidfeels or says.
Nigerian parenting has a lot unique of features worth studying. Intending parents should examine and digest these features as it guarantees success in parenting.
The following are some of these features (as elucidated by various therapists around the world dealing with the results):
1. EMOTIONAL ABUSE IS KEY:
There is power in the tongue; use that power to shape your child. Ensure your words make your child to question his/her self-worth; it is the perfect recipe for growth. For instance, when a child doesn’t sweep the compound to your taste, do not just say, “Bisi, you didn’t sweep this place well”. You must say “Bisi, you can never do anything right”.
2. YOUR CHILD KNOWS NOTHING:
Remember, children are not only stubborn, they also are quite foolish. You must remind him/her of this at every turn particularly whenever a decision about their lives is to be made.
For instance, your son, Tade wants to study Mass Communication but you want him to study Medicine. Be sure to highlight his childlike foolishness then compel him to study medicine instead (because what does he know, can he know more than his parents).
3. FEAR SAVES YOU STRESS:
Always imagine they are doing the worst and be on guard perpetually (Àwọn ọmọ ìsìn burú, children of this generation are spoilt).Their friends must also compulsorily be of the same gender as they are so as to avoid evil.
4. COMPARISON IS THE FUEL THAT DRIVES YOUR CHILD:
Yes, competition fans the flame in your child, make sure to always compare him/her to peers. For instance constantly repeat statements like “can’t you see what your mates are doing” to keep your child driven.
5. FOOD SOLVES EVERYTHING
Your primary aim as a parent is to ensure that your children are well fed; it is the most important aspect of parenting. You also must apologize with food at all times (why would you stoop so low as to apologize to someone under your roof that you feed).
Confinement protects your child: You can’t trust this generation of children so your best bet is to cage them. Don’t allow them to socialize!God forbid your daughter coming home pregnant!Keep them within your four walls where they can’t misbehave under your watchful eye.
6. SEX EDU WHAT?!!!:
This is the greatest taboo! Never mention that word around them (Jesus will not allow your child to be corrupted). They are too pure and holy for that just keep it a secret then ambush them when they get married.
An insight into why parents in Nigeria birth help us to understand why the approach to parenting is so perfectly chaotic. Marriage and birthing is borne out of society’s pressure and desperation rather than choice (once you are in your 20’s,ilé ọkọ yà, next stop husband’s house).
Many social vices in the world today are directly linked to the effects of parenting. We should read in between the lines of our children’s trauma and change our approach to parenting to ensure that our future is not dim but as bright as we would want it to be.

"If you are gifted in shedding tears, then you are fit to be the Benue State Governor",https://punocracy.com/if-you-are-gifted-in-shedding-tears-then-you-are-fit-to-be-the-benue-state-governor/,2022-05-10T15:27:39+01:00,"by: Jairus Awo
Benue State is currently looking for who to be their Governor. Well, the qualities you need to have are not much. Remember, the titles that come with being a governor are juicy, sweet, and dearing. Names likeNyamkyume, the defender of the Benue valley, and other voluntary nomenclature will follow. But be sure of the title Nyamkyume.
Perhaps, names like Asiwaju of Lagos can even be domesticated and we would have something like; Asiwaju of Benue Valley. The man with the big head. The consumer of the Benue treasury, the buyer of the Benue companies, the accuser of the brethren, the blame gamer, a talkative thief.
Before attaining these positions, there is a secret. You must be endowed in the art of shedding tears.
Let me tell you a secret: in Benue state, we don’t care if you are even a school drop out. By the way, what will a governor do with education? Even me, I was a wheelbarrow pusher and motor park conductor. Today, I dine and wine and even whine and twerk with whoever you can think of. Isn’t being a governor wonderful?
Did you just mention capacity? Oh come on. The only capacity you must have is that you must know how to channel the talk. You must learn the act of apportioning blames to the right quarters – playing the blame. You must not be on good terms with your President. And never forget, you must accuse everyone of your ineptitude.
Forget infrastructure;who e help?Infact, buy the one the state already has and sell it instead. Then buy it. Do not bother if you cannot speak good English. What happens to “fian fian fian”? These are the words to use. But you have to know how to cry in all churches when you go for a campaign.
I tell you, maybe what to add to crying is that you will lie flat at the altar in these churches, with your face buried in the ground. Make sure the pastor is already being told to put a microphone on your mouth while on the ground. Let people hear you sniff in pain. That way, you are on your way to being a Nyamkyume. Do I need to tell you? That Nyamkyume no be guy man name. Once gotten, it remains forever yours.
At times your “thing” no go stand up when you wan do the do with your wife. Don’t worry, stand up, go to the bathroom, wash yourself, the next morning, call for a press conference. Cry again that ‘your state is under siege by the ‘fulani militia’. Once you do that, Atikumulate will come to your aid and land you some rabbers. Pastors and Apostles will come and drop some bundles. Ordinarily they will mention that it is for the IDPs, forget. Just make sure your wife has a foundation. When they ask you. Tell them it’s been disbursed already.
I would like to teach you further, but I would tell you how to handle your government when you win."
Big Dream: All hail King Meffy?,https://punocracy.com/big-dream-ii-all-hail-king-meffy/,2022-05-08T02:18:45+01:00,"In the 8th month of the 6th year of the reign of Daddy Bubu; King over all of Nigeria, 5 years after the end of the unending recession, it appeared to Meffy, Keeper of the Treasury, in a dream that the root cause of Nigeria’s great famine was the imbalance in the flow and exchange of foreign currency in the country, and in order to keep his head, Meffy needed to correct this imbalance with immediate alacrity.
With a start, Meffy woke up from his dream, and in a loud roar that resonated across the four corners of Nigeria, he uttered “Ban Them!”
Early the next morn, Meffy got straight to the business of banning Nigeria’s enemies as it had appeared to him in his dream. HefingeredabokiFx as thekokoro in the efocausing all of Nigeria’s inflation, engaged him inrògbòdìyànon national television, and emerged victorious after just one round in the ring, thus displaying his great might and power.
And Daddy Bubu continued to reign in Aso rock, as the Naira continued to decline against the Dollar. Shekau and his gang of inglorious bastards having morphed into ‘bandits’ had temporarily stopped screaming haram, and Hisbah continued its hypocritic run of policing deviant behaviour in Kano State.
In the 5th Month, of the 7th year, of the reign of Daddy Bubu, King over all of Nigeria, the whispers began to float that Meffy the indefatigable, self-acclaimed saviour of Nigeria’s Economy who went head-to-head with abokiFX in the battle for Nigeria’s economy, and who dealt abokiFX a knockout blow he is yet to recover from just months ago, had thrown his hat in the ring; alongside other pretenders, to be King over all of Nigeria.
Astaghfirullah!the people exclaimed,Eewọ!they shouted. Surely, these whispers had to be a joke. Or was Meffy no longer the Keeper of the Treasury? Was Meffy no longer bound by the provisions of the Constitution? Was Meffy nowa phi seefrom top to bottom? Why was Meffy no longer disguising?
Then came the clamour. If the whispers were indeed true, then Meffy had to lose his head. Economic saviour or not. This was the height ofBastitude!and the guillotine was the only acceptable resolution.
Eruobodo, a renowned political commentator with 42 years of experience in analysing Presidential Declarations under Mokola’s bridge, however, urged caution. Eruobodo authoritatively told his captive audience that these, indeed, were only whispers, for everyone knew that serious presidential declarations were always preceded by statements of divine visitation and guidance, and anyone throwing his hat in the ring without confirmation from his god was only deceiving himself.
Meffy; according to Eruobodo, would be a fool to vie for the Kingship without hearing from his god, and urged his captive audience to remain calm and watch it all unfold.
And the people sharpened their knives and axes in anticipation of the divine confirmation of Meffy’s abomination, Daddy Bubu continued to reign in Aso Rock even as the number of pretenders vying for the throne continued to rise, while the victims of the Kaduna train attack remained in captivity."

Times are hard and seasons are getting tougher. Chances are that people have more means of income and of course, the need to chill with the big boys keeps increasing, too runkiti kiti run kata kata, tobam bamwith side chicks and to brag about days of hangovers keeps destabilising various medulla oblongatas. You may want to continue hanging out with boys and girls, nodding your black bullet rejuvenated head to some loud “Love Nwantinti” lyrics or even occupy some after dark roadside beer parlours in Gboko.How about taking a beautiful ride away from home to meet the sweet bae that makes your temperature rise. Otukpo could be your plug. Whichever way you want the enjoyment, let me tell you how to make cool money as a political stakeholder. Unfortunately, I will only tell you two ways. So stay with me.Yeah, so PDP has rescheduled their primary elections and here is an opportunity for you. APC too will follow. By all means, be a stakeholder. It doesn’t matter the party. The wisdom can be applied everywhere.Number one, if your relative just died, you are at a safer side. Then you are lucky. Schedule a date for the burial before the primary elections. Send invitation letters to all the contestants. Did I just say an invitation letter? No, trash it. Send a date for the burial and wait for the magic. You would see cars and convoys you have never seen. People would think you have made it. My dear, it’s an opportunity to cash out. They are big men and they would not stay long. Give them some chilled drinks. That way, after the burial, there will be consignments to bam bam with.Well, the second one is simple, perhaps if you didn’t lose anybody. You might have lost a mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, mamalawo, papalawo, sisterlawo or even your goat might have died before. Organise a death remembrance day for them, or another death anniversary. It doesn’t matter how long you have done it. What matters is that you are a comrade and a stakeholder. Invite them and thank me later.Usually you should pay for this, but I am a concerned citizen. I want you to chill with the big boys at City bay and some After-dark joints in wurukum, makurdi.Thank you.

Nigerian public university lecturers are criminals undeserving of pay,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-public-university-lecturers-are-criminals-undeserving-of-pay/,2022-05-04T10:06:33+01:00,"by:Maitre Jammy
Why would anyone who could scribe ‘zero’ with a bottomless bottle be a public university lecturer in Nigeria? A synonym of ‘a criminal’ in this country. You may choose to be a medical doctor, legal practitioner, engineer, journalist, obscurant or a less mendacious politician and be paid handsomely but never be a public university lecturer because your calling is a criminal offence in Nigeria, more criminal than official corruption. This is apro bonopiece of advice. Take heed!
Standing firmly on the mount of Aso Rock to defend our ever overtly responsible government, whoever thinks otherwise, should come out so we could prosecute him for speaking against the constituted authority. I am one of the leaders of tomorrow (if tomorrow comes), since no Nigerian leader of tomorrow needs any university education to become one, for that reason, I solemnly affirm to defend the leaders of today.
This current administration is the best Nigeria has had, not only because it is trying effortlessly to punish unrepentant offenders parading as public university lecturers, but also making sure that, the innocent parties (students) are not fully criminally responsible for the acts and omissions of the principal offenders (lecturers) which is why they (students) are compelled to sit at their parents’ homes for borstal training.
The following underscore the criminal activities of lecturers in public universities in Nigeria:
Firstly, the request of funding and revitalization of Nigerian public universities is maliciously motivated, reprehensibly offensive, retrospective and self-serving because the members of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) do not want innocent presidential candidates to focus more on their campaigns. University students need no vitality to study in less-revitalized university campuses. Students do not even mind if their universities are dubbed ‘glorified secondary schools’ and why should Nigerian universities be compared with other African universities? Our religious leaders have taught us that such a competition breeds rivalry, thus, it should be avoided. And nothing is too despicably wrong about the best university in Nigeria being ranked 1231th in the world, after all, there are too much universities in the world already. So, who cares about Nigerian universities?!
Who exactly does ASUU need his attention? The Minister of Education for State who has picked the APC Expression of Interest and Nomination Form for APC Presidential Primary for N100 million? ASUU does not allow Minister of Labour and Employment to focus more on his political aspiration? Lecturers’ huge demand (N1.3 trillion to be paid in six tranches starting from 2013) is too much for the government to bear; it makes Honourable Minister at the Federal Ministry of Education sick. Why should Mr President hear about the industrial action when he has ministers to represent him? Can’t the university lecturers leave so our peoples’ choices could live?
Secondly, lecturing in public universities in Nigeria is a felonious offence which attracts imprisonment for fourteen years upon conviction. Why would the university lecturers through ASUU, be challenging  their employers? Who are public lecturers to apprise the government on how Nigerian federal universities should look like? Who are they to reject IPPIS, and recommend UTAS after the Accountant-General of the Federation has rejected it? What a radical insubordination! Federal government says UTAS fails the integrity test but NITDA says it passes, wise or otherwise? Are you counting the count charges against the public university lecturers?
Emphatically, anyone who chooses to impart knowledge on any student at any federal university is committing a grievous crime, upon conviction at a Federal High Court, he may be liable for imprisonment for fourteen years. If he remains so adamantly litigious like the national President of ASUU, and appeal the case, Court of Appeal may reduce the sentence to 12 years and if he employs the service of many SAN’s, Supreme Court may reduce it to 10.
You read it very well, lecturing is now an offence in Nigeria. You must be searching the Constitution or the Criminal Code or Penal Code or an Act of National Assembly to confirm the veracity of that assertion. It is an Order-in-Council, a decree, validly made and pronounced by a minister, yet to be codified.
Why won’t they be criminals when they decide not to impart knowledge on our greatest Nigerian university students but take huge amount of money as salaries? Who does that?! Besides, those lecturers are the ones teaching students to revolt against this administration. This government will teach them the lesson of their lives; it will starve them, force them to work, stop paying their salaries or alternatively, lay them all off. This government will employ new set of lecturers from India or France or Italy or Russia or  USA and from any other countries where their lecturers are paid lesser than Nigerian lecturers to teach the students. These new lecturers, government will make sure that their salaries are deductible without any reason. The new lectures will be unable to pay their debts even through a bank loan, and will be unable to purchase a bag ofgarri(if they chew cassava flake) from their remunerations.
What is the problem of Nigerian lecturers when the Constitution says free university education and by extension conducive learning environments in Nigerian universities shall be provided by the government only ‘as and when practicable’? It is not yet practicable, it has never been practicable since 1999. But ASUU wants it now and that is why they are criminals becauselex non cogit ad impossibilia, put in another language, not even the law commands the impossibility but ASUU is trying to do! And someone says they should be paid?!
What is the utility of Nigerian university lecturers aside teaching the Computer Science students on how to become a cyber criminal? Teaching Law students to cite laws on why presidential pardon should be exercised judicially, judiciously and juridically? Educating students of economics on how to analyze the deplorable state of Nigerian economy? What have the Nigerian public lecturers produced? Medical students that could not treat their President at home? Journalists that only attack the government of the day? Sycophant political students? Accounting students who are cashiers at a Baba Ijebu kiosk? So, none of the lecturers should be paid henceforth.
Who will not adore our responsive government doing everything humanly possible to make sure no one perpetrates any crime again nor engage in any corruption? The new policy ‘no work, no pay’,  will instrumentally deter every university lecturer from committing more heinous crimes just as the prerogative of mercy has deterred the pardoned governors from official corruption. The borders are open now and any lecturer who disagrees with our government’s concerted efforts to fight corruption should leave.
This government is trying its best possible to reconstruct and rebuild university education without the public lecturers’ contributions by making sure that students sit at their parents’ homes as long as possible. After all, most educated folks with university education are the ones causing problems in Nigeria so there is a need to strategically force them out of this country.
Nigerian youths should be undereducated. We don’t need overtly educated people who will be analyzing the problems without proffering solutions in this country like Prof Farooq Kperogi. So, the best way to do this is to criminalise those that teach them at the university and their punishment shall be the new policy ‘no work, no pay’ and we say to their students ‘no school, go play’.
What we need in Nigeria is not funding and revitalizing the public universities but rather reneging on our agreement with ASUU and then forcing lecturers out of work by not paying them so Nigerian vibrant septuagenarians could obtain primary presidential ticket for N100 million without batting an eyelid and during the election, we could use the students as our political campaigners and their lecturers, returning officers."

With the way people are signing up for different social media apps, you would think their life depends on it, or maybe there is an easter egg to be won or it holds the ticket to the afterlife. But you know, as your fave partner, I have got your back, so I would hint you on ways you can spot and benefit from the social media influencer circle. Here is a list of some of the people you would have come across on the street:
– The Influencer:
These are the big social media people, telling you to DM for Ads and Promotions, with just a follower. Respect them, because you never can tell when you would need their help even with a follower that they have.
– The Grammar Police:
What these peeps are after is to ensure that everyone understands the rule of concord without making jest of such person. They correct people without making the person feel bad of not knowing the rules.
– The Fake Cabal:
These ones that post about taking Pizza whereas they’re drinking Garri and Kuli in the comfort of their shanties. This kind of people do live their life on Social Media, albeit fake, and what’s your own if they are telling you how their day went and what they’re having for dinner? Let them enjoy it while it last. Future Reality TV Show Star.
– The ‘I don’t care attitude’ League:
They post with their full chest, without blocking any of their family members. Why block them when someone else will show them? They don’t care about what people think of them, as long as what they do to them is right.
– Pictures only Geng:
This set of people only care about snapping pictures, with captions that don’t match, which one is ‘Look at me, don’t look at the caption‘. Are we supposed to look at the background?
– The Monitoring Spirit:
This set of people should be awarded as agents of the FBI, because the energy they channel in researching lost posts and previous digital footprints in unrivalled. They want to know every details of a viral post, so as to satisfy their curiosity and feed their gossip mongers.
– The Dubbers:
Yes, these are the copy cats.Who never copy, hands in the air; No hands? If you would like to emulate the attributes of your role model, so why do you care if someone steals your post?
– The Unstable Collective:
For this category, don’t mind them if they say they’re not online because they’re reading books and are not bothered about what’s going on. It’s a facade, deep down they want to be involved but are limited (no free Wi-Fi to use), so they may not be frequent on the socials.
Signing up for social media apps today is seen as a big deal especially when you’re an influencer. The ball is in your court, to decide which kind of personality you wants to be."
Recognizing a Nigerian politician,https://punocracy.com/recognizing-a-nigerian-politician/,2022-05-03T14:47:07+01:00,"by: Ifeoluwa Kayode-Dada
Nigeria, the giant of Africa, is home to various tourist attractions that makes the world marvel, from the hot and cold Ikogosi spring to the Niger River, Owu waterfall and our ever perplexing politicians.
In the interest of those of us on ASUU strike, a politician is one who is professionally involved in politics or a public office holder, but as with a number of things, the word “politician” has a unique connotation in our country, Nigeria.
Election year is almost here (my people, it’s 2023),and already, the charade andcircus is in full view. In this line-up, Nigerian politicians take center stage in their selfless and humorous attempts to hold on to power and money for the good of the masses.
Politics in Nigeria is home to a lot peculiar happenings. First of, apparently, expression of interest for the Presidency in the nation’s ruling party (INTEREST!!!!!) costs a whooping 100,000 Million Naira. Secondly, head public officials in-charge of defense advised the public to arm themselves to guard against incessant attacks. To crown it all up, current ministers of failed sectors all want to be president come 2023 (Probably, monies allocated to resolve the ASUU rift has been expended to purchase “expression of interest” form).
To unravel the root cause of these strange occurrences we must travel to the “Nigerian Politicians Games Reserve (N.P.G.R)” to gain insight into politics in Nigeria.
After a grueling study of ‘Nigerian Politicians” in the season of their utmost relevance (election season), the following are some of the must-haves of any Nigerian politician:
POVERTY:
Nigerian politicians have the masses at heart and the willingness to serve. They also, are known for their lowly lifestyle; this is why whenever they want to contest for a post “well-meaning Nigerians” always fund their campaign.
LOVE FOR THE PEOPLE:
You see, Nigerian politicians are so selfless, ever ready to drop theirAgbadato canvass for votes in the grassroots while lovingly promising the electorates good roads, selfless service and of courseGarribefore the election(2k after if you vote for them).
LOYALTY:
This is a quality so important to our politicians that it sometimes moves them to fight amongst themselves (CAUTION:This loyalty lasts for as long as the decamping bug hasn’t bitten them).However, wherever they find themselves trust them to be loyal for the time being.
ENTERTAINMENT:
Nigerian politicians also seem to love mixing politics with entertainment. We currently have a dancing senator, a “presidential aspirant also training to be an Olympic athlete and many more entertaining acts.
HONESTY:
Nigerian politicians are very candid during their campaigns, they announce their plans, promise heaven and are honest enough to tell the public when they get elected that the very plans they were elected to execute are not feasible.
The most note-worthy trait that politicians possess is a heart of service. Their primary goal is to deliver quality service to the good people of Nigeria through delivering elaborate promises and speeches.
During this line-up to the elections, dear electorate, ensure that whoever you vote for is a thorough bred Nigerian politician as that would guarantee him/her is capable of quality leadership. Selah.

Dear Tife,
After going through your letter, I can only keep thanking God for your presence in my life. I must tell you that I have more hope in this relationship than I have in the Nigerian Government. It’s with this joy that I inform you of my acceptance of your witty ideas. I’ve decided to name this project SUSTAINABILITY 2022, by this year and in October I should have saved enough to fund our new and “humble” beginning. And on the 15th of the month, I think we should disappoint those who rover parties and clamour for all series of exotic dishes. At the expense of little kids?
I would like to discuss some pressing issues with you – more of the reason I think we should go ahead with our plans. As Nigerians, we are indebted locally and nationally. And adding more debts because we’re “celebrating” is dangerous for our “debt” health.  It becomes an affront when you feed fellow debtors to secure extra debts. Are we fashioned to owe debts? Also, we would tell our distant relatives to hold to their houses. The fear of bandits and kidnappers is the beginning of wisdom.
In the future, I have always had noble plans. I know the labour market sings terror and hardship. And when my PPA decided against retaining my services, I wept. I went for the final parade as though I was going to “pass out”. It was the thought of N-power that calmed my nerves. And as I was thinking about what I would resort to after N-power, the thought of the 774,000 jobs came to my mind; hasn’t this government been so “dear” to me?

Gaining introspect from SIWES at the IITA,https://punocracy.com/gaining-introspect-from-siwes-at-the-iita/,2022-04-27T12:15:50+01:00,"by: Busayree Laila Abiodun
On a December Monday morning, 2021, I arrived punctual, all dressed immaculately in a corporate attire, ready to resume my SIWES at IITA. Only that I wasn’t ready for the shock I received.
Let me give first you a preview of the events before that for better understanding. But not before an advice;anything you wan do for this life, get leg ooo.
As an undergraduate student in the University whose course demands for a participation in the SIWES program, I had to begin looking for organizations to work at. I sent my request form to about 5 organization, but received a positive feedback from only two. Let me add that this method gave me a foresight of my job seeking in the future.
One organization gave me an actual acceptance letter, and the other, well my familybelieve say we get leg. Story short, I had forsaken the way I was actually accepted (closer to school) foron Godand I went back home
Finally after almost a month of waitingon God, I was accepted and was given a contract to sign. A fancy abroad looking contract that seems to say‘I am fancy and posh as an international organization’,but since you’re Nigerian you could decide to be lax with it’s rules and regulations. So when it says IT/SIWES and NYSC members are to resume by 7:30 am and close 4:30 pm, you can totally refuse to adhere to it and instead come whenever you wish, especially at the headquarters. What could happen except that you’ll meet closed gates at 7:30 am sharp and a smiling HR who waves at you from behind the gate doors wishing you a happy day off work?
And you don’t have to feel apprehension in preparing for a termination of your contract once the above happens three times a row. Just don’t forget to receive the letter with a smile to show them they are at lost.
Now back to the present. There was me, having desirable qualities for a office worker; punctual, smartly dressed, neat and almost perfect. If it was possible I might have even been mistaken to be a secretary.
Take this advice from me,no too dey jump before your shadow. I wish someone had told me this earlier that day before I left the house dressed smartly, then I wouldn’t have arrived at work only to be taken to the farm to work!!!!
For the record, IITA means International Institute of Tropical Agriculture.
I shouldn’t forget to add that the same people I met when I was working my acceptance letter, and had thought they were workers/cleaners there, turned out to have actually been SIWES/IT members from other schools.
There are a few more things I shouldn’t forget to add just in case the spirit of working at IITA calls upon your humble soul.
Just in case you find a snake or any animal that nature has long since declared a reincarnate of the devil, anywhere in IITA, you don’t need to hyperventilate or go into shock. Why? While IITA has washed the devil out of them leaving them with a clean soul. So all you should do is wave and smile, you might just be lucky to see them smile back. When you do though, don’t forget to take a picture so you’ll make it online, if you make it alive of course. Because apparently no one is allowed to harm any animal in IITA especially at the HQ, but like I’ve always mentioned, as Nigerians were exempted from any rule.
Also if you happen to find any discarded harvested or unharvested food on the farm or any storage house, you’re totally free to take as much as you want. Afterall, who would search you at the gate to discover them and report you to the HR? You’ll be more lucky though being an IT or SIWES member, since all that will happen is a revocation of your contract; who would be jobless enough to call your school and defame you, accusing you of stealing?
More still you can refuse to work when you’re assigned any job, it’s not like those CCTV cameras stationed around are actually working. I mean this is Nigeria, who’s watching? Definitely not a special IITA staff in charge of monitoring the CCTV cameras. So you could totally relax and flex, IITA cannot come and kill you. Afterall, it’s not like you’d need them in the future as reference.
Just have a boss like mine who’s chill, no cap. And you might just have the honor of constantly hearing his favorite sentence that is enough to put one into a big smile, it’s almost competing with the sun. “The more you advance, the more you work”. Who doesn’t love more work?
These are the few tips I think you should have in mind if you’re interested in working in an organization that doesn’t care about rules, of which IITA is definitely the best choice.
Sha remember sey,no too dey jump before your shadow.

These days in marriage (1),https://punocracy.com/these-days-in-marriage-1/,2022-04-27T11:58:16+01:00,"by: Badmus Sheriff Oluwakunmi
Dear Folu,
Congratulations on your application.
Mirage. Our marriage shall be the utmost depiction of our sustained affection. For better and for worse, for death or the cross.
My dear, I learnt about the financial stress of post-marital celebrations. If you could remember Agu’s wedding, the partying was as though he was more than an N-power retiree. I suppose he saved his stipends for all the years he had in service to throw such a party. I wouldn’t be surprised if the EFCC goes after him in the coming days. Why would you spend so much when you work under the government?
I heard you applied for the Batch C N-power initiative. I couldn’t hide my joy when I learnt this. I was first thinking of throwing a mini party for this breakthrough. Later, I thought it would be foolish of me if I started to incur pre-wedding costs on your loving and hardworking behalf. I wouldn’t then have the moral stand to write this article and our plans to launch our love to the “next level” may crash. Rather, I thank God for beginning to answer my prayers. If you remember, you keep avoiding my parents because you’ve been jobless.
My father is very inquisitive and intelligent, among my aim in writing this letter is how we would think hard and beat the old savvy. Papa would never hand me over to you if he hears that you would be jobless again in 1-2 years. He would frown at my senses.
When he asks you about what you do for a living, please think big- tell him that you are expecting orders to resume work from the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development. He would quiz you for your role in your chosen Ministry, please spread your gospel with a level of sense- kindly tell him that you’d be a Disaster Manager and a Social Developer with a focus on deconstructing, reconstructing and restructuring the brains and minds of kids in government-owned schools.
With your grammar, I believe he should be convinced and distracted that you’re one of the many Nigerian adults failed by the Nation and in true terms, your future is not bleak; it’s only being conversed for the nearest future. Papa’s main interest is in your monthly salary. Just pretend and tell him that you have no idea; but at worst, you may pocket something close to the nation’s minimum wage.
If we are successful with this introduction, our next plan should be how to develop a gentle wedding budget. I have a lot of plans. ‘Folu, we are not cooking any rice- imported or local. I know our families will be the greatest adversary in this noble course but we own our futures and we can’t allow some “guests” to feed fat and recklessly on our modest savings. You shouldn’t end up like Agu. I will like to stop here.
‘Tife,
Takia.

What Nigeria needs to solve tribalism,https://punocracy.com/what-nigeria-needs-to-solve-tribalism/,2022-04-26T08:41:59+01:00,"By: Ifeoluwa Kayode-Dada
“Arise o compatriots, Nigeria’s call obey”is what we chant from day to day. Unfortunately, Balogun hears “Yoruba’s call obey”, Danjuma hears “Hausa’s call obey” and Uchenna hears “Ndi Igbo’s call obey” (if you just slot in your tribe you are part of the problem).
Nigeria is a country-home to over 250 tribes and over 200,000,000,000 (two hundred million) stereotypes about each tribe. A brief history of Nigeria paints the picture of various tribes as monoliths forced into a unity of convenience by the imperialists. Little wonder, that the Nigerian society still functions in this light decades after independence.
In the wake of agitations from various tribes for secession and clamor for the zoning of the presidential seat to the south east, it is important that we delve into the root of the crisis, properly diagnose the problem and give adequate prescription to tackle it.
It is evident that our country Nigeria is ill and exhibiting certain symptoms which are alarmingly similar to the symptoms of the disease “tribalism”.
These symptoms include:
Before an official diagnosis, it is important to look into the lifestyle of the patient to give an accurate diagnosis. Our patient, Nigeria since inception, has been living with this aliment undiagnosed and it has only gotten worse ever since.
From the forceful merger by the colonial masters in 1914 to the civil war, even the nature of politics at the time with the establishment of tribe-based political parties (Action Group, Northern People’s Congress, National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons), it is evident that tribalism is a virus that has always lived with us nevertheless we have to treat this aliment and bandage our cuts.
These cuts run decades deep as bulk of these stereotypes are based on past events, generalizations, misdirected hate, taught and passed down negative perspectives. Truly, there are parallels in behavior of people in every family or tribe but this doesn’t justify the hate fueled generalizations.
A better approach would be to view the diversity of ethnicities in one country as a big family including siblings, uncles and aunties with different personalities, that would be the true unity in diversity.

What’s the fuss about mental health?,https://punocracy.com/whats-the-fuss-about-mental-health/,2022-04-26T08:29:17+01:00,"by: Maryam Olajide
The world has a new generation of influencers – they are bold, audacious and will do whatever it takes them to achieve their goals. They are called the “Gen Z”. You will then begin to wonder, why these set of people are the ones who romanticize seemingly irrelevant things.
There’s a new trend of performative activism, people trying to glorify mental illness, giving attention to every emotion they feel, and being overly sensitive to words and actions.
Even though research has shown that mental health issues affect the way people feel, think, and behave, they are still pretty much signs of personal weakness and not a medical condition worthy of diagnosis.
Life is not meant to be fair, and people need to know that the world has bigger problems to solve than tendering to emotional imbalances. Everyone has at one time or the other have to deal with life issues, so enough of the pity party, people need to learn how to mask it up, internalise it, and maybe give it time, it sometimes gets better with time.
There’s a very thin line between brain diseases and mental illness, they should never be confused for each other, while disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis are brain disorders, and are considered neurological diseases rather than mental illnesses. Faux scientists, who should be engaged in researches about actual (physical) illness, are expending resources to investigate the brains of people who have mental illnesses, and are trying to associate changes in the brain’s structure, chemistry, and function to prove that mental illness does indeed have a biological basis.
Well, assuming this is true, reported cases of mental illness as such is rare, and only happens in cases where people had to deal with a life threatening situation, what then is the drive to kill a mosquito with a sledge hammer?!
It’s become a trend these days, so much that you can’t go a day without encountering posts about why you should rate mental health, I mean we’re not trying to raise a generation of weaklings, So it really shouldn’t be that deep.
There’s this popular joke about how Nigerians can never be depressed, for a country whose people only recognise two emotions, anger and humour, what’s there to be depressed about? Things might not be working, the system might be failing, there might be a little bit of insecurity induced panic attack, but, in the grand scheme of things, it’s not worthy of being tagged a mental illness.
To all the self acclaimed Nigerian activists, if mental health was  that much of a big deal, why are we still stuck with lunacy act of 1958, in 2022?! This goes on to prove that there’s no urgency to this thing.
As a kind reminder to intending mental health advocates, unless you want to be associated with stigma, shame and questions as to your intentions, you better discard the thought and focus on things that actually matter."
Why public universities are the best places to study in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/why-public-universities-are-the-best-places-to-study-in-nigeria/,2022-04-22T07:30:32+01:00,"by: Sulayman Pakoyi
Nigeria has 170 universities, of which 91 are owned and bankrolled by the federal or state governments. These universities are the only hope for middle-income Nigerians to gain higher education. Aside from the unbearable private universities tuition fee, public universities are more conducive for Nigerian students; they are well equipped, adequately funded and lecturers are paid handsomely to serve the teeming population seeking a better future through education. Here are reasons why public universities are the best in Nigeria:
Conducive Learning Environment
If there is a place more conducive for students to learn it is public universities in Nigeria. The state of the art lecture rooms makes public universities stand out. It is 21 century; no institution allows students to sit on the bare floor or beep through the window to receive lectures. There are adequate lecture rooms, chairs and tables for students to receive classes.
Also, lecturers and facilitators are ready to impact knowledge and ideas using relevant materials that solve current world issues.
Friendly Lecturers
The primary role of lecturers is to impact knowledge in future generations. The cordial relationship between students and lecturers in public universities is exceptional.
Hostile lecturers are not welcome in our universities. Come on, a lecturer or professor that tells a female,“you will fail my course if you don’t grant my request”doesn’t deserve to be at any citadel of learning. I know “sex for grades” crossed your mind. Well, that was an attempt to taunt the image of public university lecturers. Thank God it failed.
Endless Holidays
Every year, public universities and the Federal Government of Nigeria have a get together to settle their differences and renew their commitment to building a sustainable educational system. Actually, it is nothing to worry about. It has been a long time tradition students fear missing out. As a fresher, you would love to have this kind of holiday in your first year on campus. In a functioning society like Nigeria where you need to find a side hustle in case“four years in LASU is really nothing.”
Politics and Spirit of Activism
As a future politician, public university is the right choice. On campus, you are offered crash courses on politics, how to win an election, intermediate your opponent, voting buying with soft drinks and snacks etc.
Of course, public varsity is the reflection of the Nigerian state, socially and politically. The spirit of aluta continua, victoria acerta and of the greatest gba gba, gbos gbos are an integral part of public universities. Activists on campus preach justice, fairness and holding elected officials accountable but don’t be surprised when student union leaders are accused of embezzling millions of naira from the student union coffers. That is how politics works in Nigeria. In the nearest future, if you plan to contest for any political posts in Nigeria, start your activism on campus. It will prepare you for the unexpected you will face in your career.
I hope I have been able to convince you, not to confuse you that public university is the best place to study in Nigeria. Dearjambite, you wouldn’t want to miss these fantastic offers that await you. Opportunities in public varsity are endless, study hard and enjoy this lifetime experience.

Ban cross-dressing! It’s more important than security,https://punocracy.com/ban-cross-dressing-its-more-important-than-security/,2022-04-17T08:10:32+01:00,"by: Alex Omenye
Everything the House of Reps decides to do, l am in support of it. The house of Reps is currently considering a bill to ban crossdressing in Nigeria. When passed into law, the bill will punish crossdressers with six months in prison or N500K as fine. I love this bill. You know why? Crossdressers are more dangerous than terrorists. We know terrorists and what they are capable of, but we are not certain when it comes to crossdressers.
Last Tuesday, a rep member, Muda Umar, APC, Bauchi state, sponsored a bill that, when passed into law, will punish crossdressers. The bill, which is an amendment of the Same-Sex (Prohibition) Act, only allows “bona fide” entertainers to crossdress. I don’t know what Umar means by bona fide, he will have to explain more as the plenary goes on.
At a time when inflation is reaching the high heavens, corruption is at it’s peak, and the Nigerian security crisis seems irredeemable, Umar is concerned with who wears what. You may be shocked at Umar’s concerns, but l am not. I mean, this guy is trying to make Nigeria better by how we dress. You can’t be wearing a woman’s attire as a guy and not pose a threat to the national security of our great country. Of course, you’re posing a significant threat to the security of Nigeria, and in the spirit of patriotism like Umar, we will not let you get away again.
A week before Umar sponsored that honourable bill, a train carrying more than 900 people en route from Abuja to Kaduna was bombed by terrorists. Chinelo Megafu, a young Nigerian like Umar was among those killed by terrorists on that train. I know why Umar didn’t call for the resignation of the minister of transport, the inspector general of Police, the chairman of the NRC. Crossdressing poses more threats than the continued stay of people whose duty was to protect the citizens they offer services to and they failed. Tell me why crossdressing shouldn’t be banned in Nigeria? The terrorists that attacked that train were crossdressed, and the security agencies mistook them for market women. The people looting our commonwealth have always crossdressed, and that has always made them to escape the eyesight of the EFCC. Crossdressers are to blame for unemployment and skyrocketing inflation. So tell me, why won’t crossdressing be banned in Nigeria?
Four hundred eighty-six people were killed by terrorists in the first three weeks of 2022, and do you know why these terrorists were able to escape getting caught by the security agencies? they were crossdressed and were using their guns as walking sticks. Thousands of people have lost their lives to terrorists and many have been displaced, but the most bothering Umar is how a man or a woman is dressed. I understand what 36 years old Umar, one of the youngest lawmakers in the National Assembly, is trying to do. The freedom that comes with dressing in whatever attire you desire is what Umar found out to be the cause of the unpatriotic dispositions of Nigerians. With the bill, when crossdressing is banned, Nigerians will become more patriotic towards their fatherland.
The bill will also reduce the cost of living, enhance security, na the crossdressers be the criminals, and solve the problem of corruption in Nigeria. What this bill will do is tremendous. More power to Umar’s elbow. When he is he done with this bill, he should also sponsor a bill that gives the senators and house of reps power to sleep audaciously during plenary. They are doing a great service to the country. The least we can reward them with is allowing them to sleep during duty. They’re trying. Let them sleep joor.
Crazy things are happening, and we haven’t seen the last of it.

"Dear Nigerian, Osinbajo is not the traitor. You are.",https://punocracy.com/dear-nigerian-osinbajo-is-not-the-traitor-you-are/,2022-04-17T07:50:39+01:00,"by: Judah Bamigboye
Were it not for my pastor’s recent admonition that one should always, like Jesus Christ, exercise patience and longsuffering even in the face of serious provocation, I would have landed two, three or more slaps on the face of my ever rambling, talkative friend, Faith, for positing with such shameless dare-devilry that Profesor Yemi Osinbajo was a serious traitor for declaring for the presidency.
He is Faith. But only in name. This was a long term friend who had thrice cheated on his wife with two neighbours. It took the intervention of other friends and I to douse the ripples of his lecherous acts of marital betrayal. And even as he pontificated, with an air of hubris, that Osinbajo was another Judas, he still reminded us all of his potential night of tryst with another distant girlfriend.
“Osinbajo is a traitor. For a man of God who attained his present vice presidential office by the sheer benevolence of Asiwaju, he should have just completed his tenure and stepped down for the grandmaster himself,’“faithless” Faith declared .
This declaration by my hypocritical friend sums up the very mood of our Social Media and political space ever since the declaration of the Vice President’s interest in contesting the presidency of our dear nation. Amidst the analysis and the beer parlour gossips, the Social Media has gone into overdrive. Many have wondered why the Vice President, knowing full well his former boss’ presidential declaration, would throw his hat into the ring. Several others have draped his actions in all sorts of negative connotations, from treachery to betrayal to backstabbing. One very lexically creative commentator called his action the “Judas-isation of our pastor-politician!”
A major point worth noting is how a collective social media hysteria, fuelled by a rented crowd has distracted a large chunk of digitally versed Nigerians, including the youths, away from serious issues around this declaration, sinking them low into the abyss of issues as  less important  as betrayal and backstabbing. These poorly veiled criticisms of the Vice President’s declaration have appeared to ignore more important matters such as the capacity of the vice president, his credentialed academic attainments, his wealth of experience in national politics, the deafening cry of Nigerians across the country for his presidency and the likes. For a nation where the subordinate implicates the boss just to gain the next appointment and have his boss demoted, where anointed protégés of former governors fight their principal tooth and nail to the extent of nearly denying them entry into the states they once governed, where an assistant pastor would go to any length to ensure the main pastor falls so he can be appointed, one wonders where the hoopla is coming from. As recently as the 70thbirthday celebrations of the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo still released a public statement, attesting to the sterling attributes of his former principal through fitting tributes. This demonstrates that his declaration is never in bad blood but with a serious commitment to the Nigerian project. As Vice President for eight years and with his ringside view of governance, Osinbajo holds every right, just like any other Nigerian to aspire for the highest office in the land.  For as long as the Vice President has not publicly insulted his former boss, or released slanderous allegations against his personality, then the national focus should be on his message and not vague contextualisations for his non-qualification.
If Nigerians think they are in for some Father-son covenant-breaking saga, they are watching the wrong political scenes. We had enough of that in Anambra, where a sitting Governor was caught on tape stark naked, making a covenant with his godfathers, and swearing an oath of allegiance. Prof Yemi Osinbajo is a serious minded man of God, who would not have sworn to any oath or visited any shrine in desperation for vice presidential nomination. It is very possible that if he had gone into any of such unholy alliance, the powers-that-be would have released such videos, since it would seriously undermine his credibility as a man of God and more importantly, as a presidential aspirant.
The revered man of God should be given a breathing space. We have had enough of serial smokers, back stabbers, perennial defaulters and internet fraudsters masquerading as genuine citizens pontificating on what should ordinarily be a non-issue.
Who are then the real traitors? The real traitors are the crowd of Nigerians who bypass electricity supply, thereby starving Nigeria of one of her most veritable sources of revenue. I refer to you, yes you! the young masters student who plagiarizes academic content and submits it as original just for marks. I also refer to the young Nigerian, who collects 5k from politician A, 2k from politician B only to vote both candidates on the same ballot paper. I also refer to the young Nigerian, who bribes his way all through, from the NIN accreditation centre to even the waste management arena. How do we forget the young man, who defrauds innocent foreigners of their hard earned dollars only to wail against SARS brutality?
Of course, I just have to add the increasing army of political jobbers and bootlickers, who would do anything for the leader, including snatching ballot boxes and running covert thumb printing of unused ballot boxes to subvert the democratic process. If you are one of these elements, before you define an innocent presidential declaration as treachery or backstabbing, you had better changeelse thunder fire you!

How to make the best out of the ASUU strike as a Uni bigger boy,https://punocracy.com/how-to-make-the-best-out-of-the-asuu-strike-as-a-uni-bigger-boy/,2022-04-02T07:52:18+01:00,"by: Alex Omenye
The annual strike happened. For the foreign readers who don’t know what an ASUU strike is, it’s usually that time of the year when the FG and the university try to mend their broken relationship. A love lost.
The strike happened. Honestly, it’s not your fault but what will ultimately be your fault is if you return to the university campus without being a better version of yourself. You’re a young boy at university. That makes you a big boy. The strike is like an opportunity to be a bigger boy.
We, the good people at Punocracy will be giving you a guide, yes you! a university big boy, on how to be a bigger boy after the strike. This guide has worked for us, and we are 99% sure it will work for you.
First, you must thank your stars for bumping into this article. After thanksgiving, the next thing you should do is decide how you’re going to be a better version of yourself.Time no dey again o.
The first thing you need to do is to refurbish your look. You can’t be a bigger boy and look like a big boy. It would be best if you upgraded your looks. It doesn’t matter if you’re light-skinned or black; you have to look great. Here we don’t follow the dictates of Alpha male, which states that men don’t use creams. Here, you have to start using creams. Your skin needs to glow. You need to turn heads. If you can’t afford to buy the creams, crowdfund with your sister or babe. Anyway, use creams that will make you glow.
The next guide is dressing in designers. You have to know what’s trending in the fashion world and follow it. You have to start dressing in the latest fashion pieces you bought at thrift stores. The man selling told you that Barack Obama wore that jeans last. Who are you to doubt him? You must not forget to wear big chains. You must look up bigger boys like Wizkid and Davido.
When you have successfully done the above, the next thing is Instagram. You go to your Instagram, and you have to optimize it to suit your current profile. In your bio, you either add, “tech bro” or “nollywood actor” or “influencer”. You then start posting hot hot pictures. Be active in that space. Get a little controversial if you can.
After successfully upgrading your status on Instagram, the market will start moving naturally. Ladies and even guys will rush your DM to ‘know you better’ This is a one-time opportunity you mustn’t miss. You have decided what you wanted in the first guide. It’s sugar boy but using a techbro or nollywood actor or influencer as the cover. When the clients start rolling in, the modus operandi will change. You will have to focus on dishing out motivational quotes every other day on Instagram. The hustle is paying off, and na God dey do am. Vacations to the places we only dream of visiting. Acquisition of designers clothes and accessories is what you will do while closing your eyes and you just bought your fifth Benz. Na God dey do am. At this point, the Nigeria you thought you had a toxic relationship with, you will realize that life in Nigeria is very very sweet. You realish it. You will start praying that ASUU never calls off the strike, but sadly, FG and ASUU have gotten back to being the lovers they were, and the strike called off.
You then go back to Uni fresh and bigger. Bigger boy. Your friends will want to know what you did, and you will tell them, “Na God”. God is the only one capable of making a big boy into a bigger boy. What God cannot do does not exist.
Dearest, if you follow these guides and implement them, there is no way you won’t be a bigger boy. It’s sure for you.
Go get that bag, and the hustle will pay. I am, and the whole Punocracy is rooting for you.

Tales from Ife: A satire,https://punocracy.com/tales-from-ife-a-satire/,2022-03-26T15:05:07+01:00,"by: Hurricane Dave
On March 17, 2022, a Professor of Agricultural Economics from the Faculty of Agriculture, Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife, Professor Adebayo Simeon Bamire, was appointed as the new Vice-Chancellor of the university to succeed the incumbent VC, Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede. This appointment has been met with tremendous uproar by indigenes of Ile-Ife, the host town of the university.
It is said that the agitation of the Ife indigenes is as a result of the fact that OAU seemed to have a bias against appointing an Ife indigene as Vice Chancellor. However, indigenes are determined to assert their basic human rights to choose who will sit on the throne of OAU. Many of them have justified this by saying that past VCs have done nothing to improve the state of infrastructure in Ife. Ife is still plagued by epileptic power supply, terrible roads, insecurity and poor economy all-round despite the presence of a world power, OAU on their soil. It is because of this that protest has rocked the whole town for the past few days… The wronged indigenes demand that the wrongs be righted instantly and they are doing so in a #sorosoke manner.
Never has a VC selection process caused this much controversy. For that alone, it is a notable season for  all OAU students. However, a myriad of other events has made this period more memorable. The events are not comical by nature. Their comical nature is an extension of the ability of Nigerians to cruise and find humour in the worst of circumstances. Talking about “suffering and smiling”. I will be bringing to you the bright spots and talking points of this protest that is presently taking the place of Russia-Ukraine in the world news.
The week started out to be a normal one until a procession of protesting indigenes hit the streets, shut down traffic, took over the gates of OAU and left numerous lecturers, students and campus shop owners stranded.
However, it didn’t look like it was going to be anything other than a normal protest until the arrival of a busload of individuals clad in white. Were they coming for an all white party? Probably. At least, that’s what we all thought until we saw that they were actually dressed like Ifa traditionalist. Now, things were getting to be a little more interesting. Maybe they were actors and their location was inside the campus? Could they be shooting a movie on campus? We were all in for the shock of our lives when we realized they were part of the protest. They got off their bus, walked into campus and began chanting incantations. Mehn! Nollywood just came to life in OAU and all the stranded people seemed glad to watch some real life theatre.
Basically, there was no difference between the old Nollywood movies and what was unfolding before our eyes. Well, almost no difference. This particular guys actually showed up with a banner with words on it. Awesome. It’s awesome the way even wizardry and traditional practices are moving with the trend. I Won’t be surprised if herbalists actually teach apprentices via online classes.
While it seemed that we had seen it all, more stuffs began to happen. We saw Yeye Osun taking bike on campus. Very humble woman, she didn’t want to disappear and frighten everybody. She even paid her bike fare. What a woman! Nigeria needs only a few other people like her and our economy will get better. There were also plenty sightings of supernatural events. Statues were seen moving all over campus and looking for people to abduct. Fortunately, no one has been reported missing yet. Ife voodoo is so powerful. Stay safe and remain indoors, guys.
If we thought we had seen enough on the first day, the second day totally blew our minds. We woke up to news that Masquerades had overrun the school premises. Masquerades were seen strolling about campus like students going about their business. We were even more shocked to see that the costume of the Masquerade showed marked differences from the norms. For one, the masquerade was wearing a red nike hose and sneakers. Sweet! A masquerade that is not out of touch with the fashion trends. This “well dressed” masquerade kept on cursing OAU at the gates and even on campus. He/she/they is(are) probably the reason we lost our NUGA game to UI male football team. We move, sha.
After hours of gallivanting around campus, offering sacrifices in front of the senate building and looking for whom to beat, the “well dressed” masquerade came out of the school gate looking crestfallen. Perhaps, this is as a result of his failure to land some lashes of the cane on some well deserving students.
A nagging fear abounds in everyone’s heart even those of the protesters. There’s this particular fighter jet that has been reconnoitering over Ife. We don’t know what it’s mission is but the popular consensus is that the jet is carrying Russian soldiers who are hell bent on invading us. Perhaps, our hunters and vigilantes should consider shooting it down with their insurmountable dane guns before the Russians hatch their plans to invade us.
Basically, it has been a week of illumination for me and the week is just even starting. I can’t wait to see what tomorrow holds for me… It is on this note that I will stop my tale.
No! Wait..one more thing. With the songs I heard at the gate today, Grammy had better give awards for musical excellence to an Ife indigene if they don’t want trouble.
Y’all shouldn’t say I didn’t advice you o.
I remain your comrade in dangerous unseriousness…

How to survive the university as a Nigerian female student,https://punocracy.com/how-to-survive-the-university-as-a-nigerian-female-student/,2022-03-26T13:23:02+01:00,"by: Maimuna Sanni
Nigeria is one country with deplorable economic, social and political arrangements. Habitation in the Nigerian society is like that of the wild; survival of the fittest.
It is no gain to say that Nigerian varsities are one of the breeding-ground of vices, and survival at these campuses is so rogue and tough. Some wouldn’t know or even believe all these, looking at the outer space of these campuses, beautiful and glamorous as they appear until such person gets admitted into them.
Surviving the university as a female student is something most students battle with, a plight I relate so much to as a female student myself. Surviving the university is a painstaking journey, being a place occupied by both hoodlums and refined lecturers mostly doctors and professors, a highly standardized code of conducts, rigid dress codes and other reserved attributes.
Being a student at the university had made me figured out some essential tips to serve as guide in surviving the university and because of the kindness of my heart, I would share. Thank me not. Hear the truth, and set yourself free.
The easiest way to balance up your academic with less stress is through socializing. It is very necessary to make a lot of friends, both with the opposite gender and especially, your male lecturers. This way, you wouldn’t be stressed much about attending classes,  besides those classes are overrated, as long as you know your ways around them. You’ll have no worries about assignments or reading for exams as you could easily bribe them with food or anything else, and your grade is certain. Chill with your lecturer in his office,bam-bamwith your fellow coursemates and you wouldn’t need to runkiti-kitior runkata-katabefore you have the best results. Besides, your level of education doesn’t guarantee or secure your future, as long as you have what we call “connection,” and the only way to get that needed connection is by socializing, so why worry?
2. Dress to impress:
They say “the way you dress is the way you are addressed.” Don’t you want to be addressed as the most beautiful and sexiest girl on campus? Well, as a female who wants to survive the university, you shouldn’t be found in boring attires or cover-up dresses. God has blessed you, and you should be kind to bless your viewers too!Shedi balabalain yourashawodresses, and if you don’t have, it’s not a crime to borrow from friends or roommates as long as you look good – it’s all packaging. As a lady,  the goal is not to be stared at  only once. Put on harsh perfumes and let your shoes do the talking. All eyes should be on you when you walk into class and trust me,you go girl!
3. Live, only to the fullest:
I know that as a female, there are so many rules both the school and your parents must have set down for you, but little do you know that those rules are only to restrict you from enjoying your life. Darling, don’t you want to burn out all the stress school has been using to eat you all up? If you would like to, then do whatever makes you happy – attend that party, go clubbing and get as high as you can. Because, in the end, they say “All work no play makes Jack a dull boy.”
4.Don’t hesitate to fight back:
It is normal to see people to get on your nerves as a lady, especially in a Nigerian university. Don’t be scared to put people in their place. Bully people that come your way; after all, survival of the fittest is the code we all live by, and you are only trying to survive too. Well, the worse that can happen is an expulsion, an automatic graduation without certificate, but guess what?We meeeuve.
These rules, if followed completely, would make survival on campus easy for you as a Nigerian female student and create room for opportunities that’ll make you successful in the future. So, ball unto forever,omo ope.

How to be a good child at home during the ASUU strike,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-good-child-at-home-during-the-asuu-strike/,2022-03-23T07:02:02+01:00,"by: Adebola Makinde
Adeola, a whole LLB in Law. See yourself?
Damn! ASUU strike is a mess. For once, you’re intentionally home because of strike. The last time it happened, it was a year of tragic events: End SARS, Coronavirus Pandemic – hashtag Covid-19 and ASUU ; cursed country as it is!
Now, you’re in your third year. You should have stayed back in school. Whenever they call you, you just form one unfazed voice and when they bring matters like “we can’t send you money — because, what are you doing in school?”—they would say that in your indigenous language though after the longest convo in English—you’ll now act puzzled as if they were insensitive not to know you’re closing some million-dollar deals in school—you’re now pained and you abruptly hung the call. You’ve guilt-trapped them.
Obedient child like David!You came home. The first day at home after a while, your mum came to hug you. Your dad was out. You felt special and you posted“no place like home” on your WhatsApp status.
But, Adeola, a whole you is now a babysitter. Not just that, did you also marry your father because all these chores have become normalized for you — are you his wife or …? They will call you in their husky tone tearing apart as if they were in their 60’s yet with agile bodies. These people are rude. A whole one year of peace because you didn’t visit home. They badly want to provoke you.
Omo. Dem go collect oo. Dem no sabi cultist?— Of course, they don’t even know what you’re up to in school. You that you’re the Vice President in your fellowship; Assistant Prayer Coordinator in your department fellowship; a CEC for your faculty, a whole General Secretary.Na you dem dey call anyhow?
Now, you helpless fool would act ignorant. You don’t know what a typical African home is. Is it because you started school when you were15?Shuuu.
You remember Kolawole. His parents have left him to himself. He now sorts his tuition and whensapaknocks, he’s unable to seek help from them. You’ve witnessed him beg his parents and they just acted unbelievably ridiculous. They hung up the phone on him. You heard“omo ita”in an old fashioned yoruba tongue. That was definitely his mother. She cut off her feelings already. Kolawole was the same guy to ask you out when you had just resumed a month in school. He studies Physical Health Education yet unable to look fit.
Your mother sings you a song. You now try to remember. You remember a tune:“omo to mo ya re loju o, osi o to mo na pa.”—  It is a warning tune in your culture. Adeola, how do you want to cope because this strike is the beginning of the end or is it end of the beginning? —  You’re most likely to be back home after attaining a degree. Whatever.
You must device a plan. This way your tuition gets paid. They wouldn’t remind you of gutter attitudes you displayed when you’re back to school. Your data subscription is intact but this time you’re never going to mention anything about home.Na you f*ck up.
Here is a draft:
i.) Get up by morning as early as you can andtake up your daily chore.
ii.) You might as well help inplanning; parents do heavy tasks such as planning. You know they want to feel your presence that’s why you’re home. It’s up to you my dear.
iii.)Drop that phone. African homes especially parents of the 60’s are not seeing the potential in a digital globe. Hopefully, someday. Spend a considerable time on phone. You don’t want them to think you’re not reading in school.
iv.)Flex. You can’t be the same Adeola they knew before you left for school. At least, something as a change  — something to make them believe you grew over there. Maybe, some spice up in your dressing. It shouldn’t be excessive. Something moderate.
v.)Pray. My dear, do not forget this religion thing is the authencity of a responsible person.
vi.) Let off the “i-am-busy-tag”. Parents must really hate this. How can you get busy for them? Remember you’re still a child.Dem still fit wipe you cord for head. They want all the attention even if you’re in a zoom check-in meeting with your boss.
vii.)Keep your face down. Over time, you’ve had quarrels with your hostel mates and you’re most of the time having a point to get angry. It’s unlike the case with your parents. All fault, you must admit. If you dare look into their eye, your dead grandfather would hear the tale. Your parents would suddenly become the BBC in the family.
Now that you’ve read the golden rule, it remains that your adamamt heart listens. Few word is enough for the wise. If you like, mess up. Your strong head would always lead you back home.
Whenever Mr Idris, your father’s friend is leaving, he’d surely squeeze some cash in your hand. Adeola, you’ve trained yourself hard for this — to be called a “good child” — collect it.

To be a real gee,https://punocracy.com/to-be-a-real-gee/,2022-03-22T09:33:14+01:00,"by: Destiny Okoduwa
You are seated there, head bent over an opened past question leaflet, amidst teenagers like yourself in a UTME tutorial. I am in your head, hoping you’d hear me whisper words that’d douse your ignorance scheduled to display in a minute from now. This is what I am muttering:to be a real gee is to love football.Below is the template of my unpopular opinion.
The teacher needs to cite an example for the lesson he is teaching, so he chooses sports. He points to you and throws the question, probably so he can do more justice to his explanation. “Who is your favourite football player?” he asks.
You do not think twice before answering. Defying my whispers, your reply is an audacious and point-blank retort. “I am not a fan of sports.”
The class glare at you, boys and girls alike. You have just vomited the abominable. There’s a short-lived hush, then whispers spread swiftly before climaxing to an outburst of peals of giggles. Who does that? Do you not know that you are first a boy before a human who has a choice to pick his interests and disinterests. The study of Civic Education and Government in high school has made it known to us that there are limitations to almost every right, if not all. And this is where you must have lost it. You probably haven’t been paying attention to those subjects in class.
If you ask me, this is why the reaction of the class is justified: according to chapterNigeria, sectionSociety, sub-sectionNorm, it is emasculating for boys to have feminine interests. Terribly unheard of if they’re indifferent about sport, football especially. How can you say you do not enjoy the ecstatic feeling of watching people struggle to gain possession of a spherical object? You should have just said something, at least the names of footballers you must have heard or read about by chance, say Lionel Messi, because we live in a world where people’s validation is oxygen,abi?
My dear, you have to learn to reconstruct yourself into a peg that fits the hole that society has dug for you: that you, as a boy, have no business wearing pink, bracelets, and a host of other things tagged ‘solely feminine,’ lest you stand a chance of being called names reserved for people of the sort: sissy, princess, et cetera. I can swear those are what your classmates would call you but for fear of being scolded by the teacher. You see? On this side of the divide, humans totter between fear and detest for what they do not understand, and when it gets to a certain point they give it a name, however derogatory.
Why do you think young adult males now purchase beard-growth creams? A boy who is of age should start sporting a beard regardless of individual differences during puberty and post-puberty. You don’t want to be referred to as a princess, do you? Especially on the blue app (it’s usuallyall cruise and inshallahbut let’s just pretend these remarks don’t come back to taunt them behind the screens of their phones—there’s always an iota of truth in every jocular remark.)
If you look closely, far beyond the cotton, flesh and tissues, you’d see that engraved in the minds of the students glaring at you is the question: how dare you disrupt how we’ve been programmed? Let me tell you: be it consciously or unconsciously, they’ve been programmed to abhor difference and anything, ideas or appearance that do not conform to conventions.
So dear you, this is me using this reverse psychology to admonish you. But I must first inform you that adherence is at your own risk. So here it is: to be a real gee is to love football, to be obsessed with it like the provision of your three-square meal depends on it. You must have something to say during football discussions amongst your peers. Isn’t it ideal to have an opinion on everything? This admonishment loosely translates to: to maintain relevance is to be prone to conformity. It is pertinent therefore that you please people at the expense of displeasing yourself, that you bury your interest if they’d raise eyebrows. To hell with the clichédbe yourself,my dear, to hell!

7 types of women Nigerian men do not want to marry anymore,https://punocracy.com/7-types-of-women-nigerian-men-do-not-want-to-marry-anymore/,2022-03-20T08:37:24+01:00,"by: Esther Omoye
Getting married is not just the problem anymore too but maintaining a happy relationship; and this is not just about avoiding the wrong kind of person or finding the right kind of person as it’s a cul-de-sac. It is not always easy knowing who is best for you when you don’t know how they will turn out in the future.
However, there are certain traits some women possess that give them away today. I know it is a cultural stereotype for women to have several kinds of men they don’t ever want to see themselves getting married to. But also just like women, men have some eccentric characteristics they look out for in a woman to make her suitable for marriage.
To avoid any contextual misconceptions, specifically Nigerian men in this case. It is no joke with Africans when it comes to getting married and especially to a “good woman.” In Nigeria, there’s a proverb that says; “A man who has found a good woman has done him and his kindred good.” It is a common belief here in Nigeria, that a woman is not married to her husband alone but to his whole household. It doesn’t worry me to say; this is why an average Nigerian man should have muttered the generic sentence“God forbid I no fit marry dis kain of woman”more than five times before actually meeting his type of woman if he is really serious about getting married and not just some wannabe woman wrappa.
Here are the 7 types of women, Nigerian men don’t want to marry anymore:
1. The Bitter Feminist
If the devil had an actual spawn? These women will be dragged to hell with an actual postcard saying “Drag me to hell”. The Bitter Feminist is on the top of the list of types of women, Nigerian men don’t ever want to get married to. In Nigeria, “Feminist” was a common insult. Women whom fell and falls under this category was described and is still described as“scorned,” “bitter” “Satan’s sister,” “bitter leaf,” “mad woman,” “Man hater,” “Old cargo,” “overachiever,” “Mrs independent,” “witch,” “stubborn,” “dreamer,” and “home wrecker”.They are detested by more than half of the male population in the country, no man wants anything to do with a “Bitter Nigerian feminist” when he could be inLa Vida Locawith a well behaved, submissive and culturally ingrained Nigerian woman.
For years, identifying as feminist in Nigeria has been fraught and illogical. You’d be described as acrazed-wannabe-power-house-african-woman-who-had-lost-her-senses-in-either-reading-too-much-or-just-following-a-trend-you-know-nothing-or-little-about-and-just-needs-a-real-man-to-handle-all-of-her-issues-to-think-straight-againin one breath. The bitter feminist types have been accused of several things infamously; promoting promiscuity in women; creating an unnecessary upheaval in the social cultural construct (especially in a society ingrained in “hegemonic masculinity”), disrespecting cultural norms, creating a chokehold on patriarchy and introducing an impossible slurs of tenets to promote gender equality and protect womanhood.
The Bitter Feminist is a big No-No and a huge red flag for a Nigerian man; as she is the woman who doesn’t believe and follow the “head and neck” description of a husband and wife, who wants to work and have a successful career and not be a housewife, who wants her husband to see her as  his equal, who wants her husband to assist in house chores without necessarily being asked, who will never ever tolerate just anything from her husband, expects him to be loyal and accountable for his actions, she is highly outspoken and wants to make as much decisions as her husband concerning her family. The Bitter Feminist is regarded as an highly illogical and the very worst type of woman to ever marry by Nigerian men. They’d rather bulge out their own eyes before they get attracted to one or even consider her for marriage.
2. The Two-timing Delilah
The Karishikas! Lord save their souls!!I don’t think there’s anywhere in the world, where cheating women are scorned more. A Nigerian man will never ever settle down for a cheating woman, even if she’s the one he loves or his also cheating; because duh, two wrongs can’t make a right and Nigerian men are genetically predisposed to cheat. He will never forgive her cheating acts when found out too. To a Nigerian man, a cheating woman is an ungrateful woman and there’s never a justifiable reason why a woman should ever cheat on them or even worst make them their  “lover toy-boy”  to a supposedly better man (a “Muguaka ATM”) and even in reverse too.
No Nigerian man will ever accept that slap on the face! Being the “other man,” to be stringed alongside another man in a committal relationship is to be considered a Simp. A Nigerian man will never settle for a Delilah and if he does, he will question her value and desirability all through their marriage and shack her into the DNA joke alongside his friends, family members and anybody who cares enough to give two cents whenever things go bottom struck.
3.The Self-Entitled Woman
These are our “Folakes” the Netflix and chill babes. The ones whom Nigerian men make a “feminist” joke out of. The urgent 2k babes, the highly expensive first dates babes, the you have to buy me a new dress if I’m going out on a date with you babes, the there’s a new bag I want to buy babes, the my subscription is finished babes, the I booked a bolt ride to your place babes, the you’re not even my type kind of babes, the how much did you even spend on me babes.
These type of women unfortunately do not fall under the category of “being spoilt by their men”, rather they fall under the infamous catchphrase “It’s a give and take” world. These are the type of women that will drag the living hell out of their existence when they can no longer afford the lifestyle she wants to lead or they are no longer interested in throwing around money for a fickle moment and especially for a woman who thinks, their attraction to her is worth all of their life savings and investments. A Nigerian man would always be a maze runner for his attraction towards any type of woman. But will he ever settle for a Folake, or who knows?
4. The iPhone Series League Women
The Nigerian movie industry would ever consider adapting a spinoff of its 2000s smash hit “Blackberry Babes.” It will rightly be titled “iPhone Babes.” Trust me a little bit on this one; Nigeria is the “Big Apple City.” now.
When a woman from this league flashes her phone their way,  it’s like a flaging semaphore! They take for their hills because she’s readily profiled as high maintenance “na iPhone dat babe dey use o“. To marry a woman from this league you’d have to be a millionaire and have tons of thousands to spare on gifting her a new iPhone as the series come and go.
These are the women, Nigerian men claim want nothing to do with you, if you can’t afford an iPhone or a newer series for them, the succubuses that stay back as long as you feed them right. It is claimed women in this league, can’t even afford themselves the phones if things were otherwise and just look for men whom readily make them the “it” girl by affording an iPhone that suits their every whim. An average Nigerian man detest women in this league, they see their demands as very frivolous and see the iPhone as just another ostentatious object that should not be possessed at cutthroat!“Shey I no know wetin I wan dey use money dey do?”
5. The Bone Straight League Girl
The Bone Straight is a type of raw, straight and firm hair that is thin, sleek, scanty and well knotted from the weft to the bottom. The straightness of the hair it’s why it is being referred to as “bone straight”.
The bone straight hair has caused so much ruckus in the Nigerian dating scene, with women allegedly breaking up with their men if they can’t afford one or afford a newer one. This has pencilled in more reasons why Nigerian men picked to cancel the bone straight geng from the list of women they’d ever consider getting married to. Though traditional protective styles have become acceptable to wear everyday but you can never tell a woman want to do with hair and taste.
6.The Tiktokers
Tiktok is just for the fun of it, but it seemed to have gone out of control for most Nigerian men who started showing disgust for the application and it’s popularity during the Silhouette challenge on the platform.
Nigerian men claimed women whom were involved in this challenge left nothing but digital footprints for their future kids to find and prospect husbands to be disappointed over. They also claimed all Nigerian women who were involved in the challenge, are unworthy to be called wives to respectable men or considered for marriage.
They didn’t stop there, they went on to describe any Nigerian woman active on Tiktok as indecent and jobless. They dragged the application for promoting promiscuity, a total waste of time and a hidden propaganda to shame women unknowingly. They claimed the platform had viral challenges for women which only  had to do with dressing up, changing outfits, twerking or dancing provocatively to trendy songs and nothing else at all. They called it tasteless and also a decline in the budding radical femininity we claim to possess now “Feminism”? Do they even know what’s feminism one Twitter handler tweeted, Dis one dem no know anything, na follow go, follow come another handler replied.
It is no joke that being a famous or active Tiktoker is a red flag for some Nigerian men. Most Nigerian men have denounced the application over and over again on Twitter. Describing women there as irresponsible, jobless and lacking any sense of dignity, because all they do there are dance in thin outfits for unknown men just for likes and comments. A Nigerian man will never want to settle for an active or famous Tiktoker especially if she has those supposedly digital footprints around.
7.The Allegedly Typical Nigerian Woman without a Marrow of Reciprocity in her Full Fledged Body
Reciprocal actions differ from charitable actions in that reciprocal actions only follow from others initial actions, while selflessness is the unconditional act of social gift-giving without any hope or expectation of future positive responses. Or who knows? giving with very limited expectation or the potential for expectation of future reward.
The women in this category are what Nigerian men refer to as the “piggyvests,” the ones who’d take everything you offer them and even ask for more without ever being bothered slightly of what they give back! They’d save it all up. These are the takers and never the givers, and what makes this more appalling is that an average Nigerian man rules out that to nine times they’ve gifted women they’ve been in relationships with or married to they’ve not been gifted once or merely gifted the staple Nigeria male gift idea ” A pack of briefs” or are never treated out by their significant others or have their own cards maxed out on days their women decides to treat them.
Nigerian men see it as a Nigerian woman thing; popularly referred to as “The Stingy Nigerian Woman Syndrome.” a behavioural disorder that gives them so much comfortability to never ever reciprocate the men they are partnered with. It was just the month of Love and Twitter was on fire, as women received so many romantic gestures, expensive gifts, dinners and treats in several recorded videos but a very minimal number of men got the gesture reciprocated. Us women; real minimalists!
This sent Nigerian men tongues wagging and angry on how an average Nigerian woman would always want to collect and never give back(they deliberated if it was because of the cultural phenomenon that men are considered providers and so many women liberate themselves in this guise and see nothing wrong with taking from Adam and never giving back.) Even in marriage; she will save up all of your money to build herself a mansion and continue spending your earnings with you! one twitter handler tweeted.If I buy babe bone straight sha, she gat buy me wetin I want too, I carry her go Maldives, we no dey go Dubai na UKlike Teni and Eazi another tweeted.
It seems most Nigerian men might be opposed to the idea of their wives keeping a corporate job but they are definitely not against the idea of their wives contributing even in the littlest ways or being treated out by their partners once in a while. Nigerian men definitely are on the lookout for such women and want nothing to do with a “stingy koko” anymore. A woman, who’s earnings are clogged to the pot like an okra! God forbid bad thing.

The action takes place in the living room of the unpaint and unfenced bungalow house of the Senate President in Abuja. He convenes a secret meeting to caution both houses on the dispute they usually have making them to be exchanging blows on the floor of the house. The Rep. Chairman, a senator and a Rep. member were involved in the meeting.
After three of them have alighted from their Audi and Mazda cars and parked them beside a lonely problematic and dusty Lexus jeep with a faded brown colour, they meet beside the house and they begin to troop in through the balcony.
Inside the sitting-room, are three massive couches, with a small table made of glass in-between; all were placed on the red rug of the untiled floor. The one opposite the two small couches is the biggest. Up the room are two dangling ceiling fans and on the wall is a big  plasma TV set positioned above a DSTv decoder and fritz DVD set with intertwined black wires. Both are place atop each other, on a small brown stool.
Just beside the TV set are two frames the first one is having the portrait figure of the posed Senate President wearing a plastic smile and the other features him and his nuclear family. Senate President and the Rep. chairman sit at biggest couch while both senator and the Rep. Member take their sit at the two other couches in front.
Senate President: Ada! Please bring water for my visitors.
Ada: (from afar) si…r !  okay sir!
Rep. Chairman: Is mummy in?
Senate President: Huh! She just left for the market.  How are your families?
All: They are all fine (they answered in unison)
Ada: Here, sir (she first pours the water inside the glass cups in front of the two persons who sat together and then to the two people who sat separately in the cups she places on the small stools beside their couches)
Senate President: If anybody asks about my whereabouts, tell the person I am not in.
Ada: Okay sir (she genuflected a little andexits)
Rep. Chairman: (He sips the water in the cup and place it down) As if you do know I’m thirsty.
Senate President: This heat is too much, and that is why I definitely know you will be thirsty (Addressing the rest of the people) Ah! Why don’t you drink your water?
The other two:Haba! Don’t worry sir we are okay (in unison).
Senate President: Alright.
Rep. Chairman: President sir, (addressing the Senate President, who was about to leave) when I heard an alert tone earlier, I thought it was a salary alert I don’t know that it was an MTN message when I checked my phone.
(Exits Senate President)
Senator: I heard you talking about salaries earlier. My brother! you better forget salary this month and let us move on. Hopefully, we may get salary next month (the senator, who was busy scrolling through his phone screen in search for message, bursts out).
Rep. Member: Have we received our wardrobe allowances let alone the salary you are talking about? Have you forgotten that during the last sitting, it was only cheap wine, instead of the usual Champagne and Chicken, that was served?
Rep. Chairman: Ahh! Yes you are right.
Senator: You can’t believe that, I haven’t settled the weekly upkeep allowance of my children studying at the University in UK. I just told them to go like that I will settle it later when I received my salary.
Rep. Member: Your situation is fair. I couldn’t get the 50 gallons of fuel I manage for my cars through the back door, as always, so I had to call a friend at the fueling station to work things out. Imagine me going through all that stress.
Rep. Member: It is saddening that our constituents and the people out there would not realize that suffer this much too.
Senator: Exactly. You knowehn,thatyeyeASUU is very funny. I learnt that they are on their umpteenth perennial strike again. They do not even know that, the legislators, are going through a lot in this economic downturn.
Rep. Chairman: They asked us to enact a law banning the children of public officials from schooling abroad. A bunch of jokers they are.
(Enters Senate President)
Senate President: Pardon me for the lateness, I was rummaging for my glasses in the bedroom and thank God, I have retrieved it. Can we start the meeting?
All: Ah, yes. Definitely. We can start (they said in unison).
Curtain falls.

How to be a Nigerian undergraduate,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-nigerian-undergraduate/,2022-03-11T08:33:39+01:00,"by: Raheem Omeiza
I started out dumb and idealistic but that anomaly has since been rectified. Here are a few useful tips on how to be an undergraduate in Nigeria:
Always. Logic doesn’t work in Nigerian universities outside notebooks and it must never be used in real life. In time, you’ll learn to find fault with yourself first. You’ll have the pressing need to respect the sanctity of the University by never speaking ill of it. Society needs broken people that can find ways to function in a broken system. Don’t fix the system, fix yourself.
2. Morality is the ultimate endgame
If you’re a student in Nigeria and a lecturer has never taken out time to preach to you, you should be ashamed of yourself. How else will you know God? Some really kind ones go the extra mile by incorporating body-shaming into the routine. Jezebels that fix nails and hair are going to hell. This is known. Why in the world will University students use hair extensions, faux lashes, and wear makeup? Lecturers may touch students in places they do not want to be touched behind closed doors later but you know how it is, right? These people have needs. May God bless them for their contribution to education in Nigeria.
3.Going to the Administrative Block is an extreme sport
This is a mindset you have to work with always. No one likes you. No one cares about making you comfortable, least of all the non-academic staff. You have to brace yourself for impact when you need to submit a letter or ask for a form. Universities don’t want pansies that can’t take a bit of abuse. They’re only going to yell and cuss at you, make you come back a dozen times, and generally frustrate you. Nothing unheard of. These things help you build character. So, be strong mentally and emotionally. A few weaklings have been known to break down and cry out of frustration. Me? I eat abuse for a living now.
4. You must pass always
Nigerian varsities don’t tolerate failure in any form from students. Failure of staff is celebrated though. They’ve earned the right to fail. What’s your excuse for failing as a student? You weren’t taught? So? Didn’t other people pass? You probably didn’t read the lecture notes you were not given. All lecturers passed against all odds. Some had to swim rivers and climb mountains before they got to school, and still, they passed. So, what’s your excuse?
5. Respect and Humility should be your watchword(s)
“You can never get anywhere in life if you’re not humble.” Grovel, beg, and kiss ass for what is your right. If you must complain, lace it with several words of praise before the sheepish “but”, and make sure you apologize immediately after. This is the only acceptable way of getting anywhere in life.
If you follow these tips, you are bound to have a swell time as an undergraduate in any Nigerian varsity. Trust me!

"What Is Poetry, If Not a String of Meaningless Words?",https://punocracy.com/what-is-poetry-if-not-a-string-of-meaningless-words/,2022-03-10T16:57:29+01:00,"by: Mariam Oziohu Abdulsalam
For the sake of this guide, we shall be referring to every other person as laymen, even though they pretend like they aren’t. They have gone out of their way to declare your poetry bad. But we all know, from the deepest part of our hearts, you are the only person on the right track.Shebiyou’ve added words together and they even rhymesef, so where are they seeing the bad poetry from?Ta! It cannot be from you.
I know you’ve been made to believe that poetry is difficultblah blah blah.All those literature students mumbling about iambs and sonnets, calling big words to make you think you can’t understand or write good poetry. All lies! I’m here to debunk all that myth. Just adhere to my steps and you will see how great a poet you become.
Let’s begin!
Have an Instagram account that is dedicated to posting five-line poems
Instagram poetry is the reigning style of poetry. Everyone there is a poet. The rate at which poetry pages blow up is insane! Who stanza and rhythm don help? When you are not Shakespeare or even J.P Clarke.Abeg no dey dull yourself.  Just mix words together –she was beautiful even when you didn’t notice.Draw a tiny flower or something that looks like a woman’s head beside the words and voila! Poet extraordinaire! Instagram people will connect with anything you write. Ask Rupi Kaur and see if I’m lying. This is the surest way to become a poet.
Put in less effort
An advice from one poet to another; don’t do too much, don’t try too much. You don’t want to appear desperate. Desperation is a really bad thing in this game. As a poet, you can’t be writing everyday. Any day you remember that you identify as a poet, just rush and write five lines down. It should not pass five lines oo, because people will not read it. No go dooversabi.
Love and heartbreak!
Yes, that’s right. Construct a sentence about the heart. Right there is a magnificent poem. Nothing beats this type of poem because it’s the most relatable. You want us to see that you are capable of love. When your boyfriend/girlfriend buys you something, write a poem. When they serve you breakfast, write another poem. Show us vulnerable and raw. Before you know it, you have a hundred poems on love saying the same thing. All na PR and these laymen are not so bright. They will read anything on this theme.  Check these examples out and lie that your soul is not moved.
– I don’t need ‘anything’ from you. I just want ‘everything’ with you.
– Take me to your heart, I miss home.
– Life without you is colourless.
Remember that you are aiming for overdramatic lines. The cheesier, the better.
Use extremely-tired metaphors
Her eyes like oceans, I could swim in them forever. Don’t let anybody deceive you. There is nothing like cliché metaphors in poetry. These lines never get tired so write wetin you sabi. What do these laymen know? Trying to dictate what is cliché and what isn’t to you. If you like it, write it like that. Who cares if you’ve already used it like ten times?
Channel your poetic voice
This is for my aspiring spoken word poets. You know the voice I’m talking about na. That one that’ll make anything you say sound good. Anything and everything can sound like a poem if you use this voice. Even if na rubbish you write, when you start saying it, e go make sense for ear. People will snap their fingers to nonsense. In fact, they don’t need to hear the words, just be bold. Raise your voice and manifest poetry darling.
Copy other poets
This is an art! And as a poet, you must be good at it. Any poet wey tell you say he no copy na lieeeeeee!. All we do here is copy and paraphrasing. So much work! Again, these laymen simply cannot understand the efforts we put into it. If you know how to copy very well, poetry is the path for you. All thegiraffe-ingyou’ve done in exams were leading you here all along. You just didn’t know.Copy, write, copy, write.Easy peasy.
Have a cool sob-story
Nothing makes a poet successful like a good sob story. Tell us how your parents didn’t support your dreams, tell us about the girl that called your work trash, tell us how you used to be awkward and weird in school… until you found poetry. Breathren, concoct that story. This is your ticket into the poet community. This is what would decide if you would be accepted or not. How else would your audience connect with you if that can’t feel the sadness radiating off you. Show them that you are one of them. That you have huge problems too. Na wetin go sell you be that.
Violence!
Are you even a poet if you haven’t written a poem on police brutality, corruption, black lives matter or tribal conflicts? Every one is eager to read your own view on those violent events. Write a bloody poem. End SARS dada dada da! These poems sympathize with the public and that’s what everybody is writing these days. Join the gang!
Congratulations!you are now a master of poetry. Any layman that tries to defame your work all in the name of constructive criticism, slap the person. How dare they question your skills?"
How to be an Ideal Nigerian Young Adult,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-an-ideal-nigerian-young-adult/,2022-03-10T16:30:28+01:00,"by: Kuti Fatiha
Now that ASUUdon deyon strike, the“is this how you behave in school?”syndrome would be prevalent in Nigerian homes, especially when some of your ideologies are changing. However, you must protect these traits, as you are now elite, and make your parents see the light. You want your parents to showcase you to their clique as the best young adult ever? You want your siblings to boast about their proud elder in school? Find out which how you get suited for the role of young adulthood.
1. Look at them in the eyes:
Early in the morning, just look at them in the eyes and greet them. It’s not necessary but just do it. You are an adult now, and independent. Show it.
2. Leave the household chores for others
The hall-mark of evolving adulthood is discarding household chores, like doing the dishes. It is below your new grade, and it has to stop. What if you were not given birth to?Na why you have siblings to do the work na. You are no longer the housemaid they think you are. They should suck it up.
3. Go out anytime you want:
You’re in the University already, so why do you need the permission of your parents before going out to have fun with your friends?Jaiyeloand do not be afraid of the safety your parents always whine about. Recklessness is part of adulthood, and we live only once. What best way to live, if not to the fullest?
4. Eye your parent’s visitors:
Since those family members that have turned your house into their free eatery, it is your duty to remind them the courtesy and morals they lack. Your home is not a refugee camp and you do not run an aid group, so there is no reason why they should visit your dwelling in expectations of free food. Eye them in a vicious way, so they realize the implications of their bad habits. Your parents taught you well. Now is the time to pass it on.
5. Don’t bother yourself with your siblings assignments:
You should realize now that you owe nobody a damn thing, and that includes your parents and your siblings. You have got a life to live, so no one should intrude your plan of flexing by enticing you to deal with trivialities, like helping with the homework.Tufiakwa. Since daddy does have the money, why can’t he just hire one of the best teachers in your siblings school and take them through their assignment. You were not born to suffer another person problem. Know this.
I know you are in the mood to thank me, but don’t. These are tips that have helped in our transitions to young adulthood, and we owe you the sacred duty to pass it on. So, dear reader, pass it on too. Save lives from the shackles of disguised slavery. Every good deed counts. Trust me, our parents understand too."
Keys to the Secret of a Successful Nigerian Entrepreneur CEO,https://punocracy.com/keys-to-the-secret-of-a-successful-nigerian-entrepreneur-ceo/,2022-03-08T16:04:26+01:00,"by: Jimoh Aishat Omotolani
With the situation of things in Nigeria, you do not need an eyewear to see thattins tuff. Getting by is no beans for averageNaijayouth, so everyone is into one business or another. For people of my generation, we call them ‘online vendor’, ‘CEO’. And, for every other youth like me with a Nigerian’s survival instinct, we refer to it as ‘side hustle’ (e go pay o!). So here are few tips to make your ‘hustle’ pay and make mama proud.
Tip 1 – BE OUTSPOKEN:
As a Nigerian vendor, you are aware of how some customers can be so inquisitive and all. So, once you are frustrated, there is no need to filter. The business is yours so run it as you deem it fit. Boss, anyone that asks for pictures of items for too long, don’t send o! That is asurahof a stingy customer and their type do not end up buying a single item LOL. With the level of heat in this country, no customer should be frustrating your life. They should go elsewhere. Your own customer will come now,abiwhat?
Tip 2 – REVIEWS:
My dear, why exactly should you act on what someone feels about the service you rendered? That Miss Titi of First Bank lacks manner. When next she gives bad feedbacks, ensure you give her a good ‘lecture’ and recommend for her a good doctor to treat her tongue (something is definitely going on with her taste buds). Or is Nafiu from Tipper garage not human? He had ordered severally without complaints and such is the review you should post so more customers can come in. Who is Miss Titi?If you broke, na her business?Please, don’t let anybody pour sand in your garribiko.
Tip 3 – SOCIAL MEDIA:
Apart from that your Facebook, I do not suggest using any other platforms. To be honest, WhatsApp is just useful for class group messages or maybe sometimes, posting peng pictures/videos and ‘vc anyone’? So, the honest advice is, use Instagram to boost your sales. Don’t be mistaken, it is not just for the glamour and all, people make massive sales! CEO, welcome us with ‘NO SCAM ZONE’ in your profile. You might want to add the ‘no’ signal too. This will build the trust and confidence needed in you and your business. Also add ‘NO REFUND’ o!  Why would a person order, return and still demand refund?Abeg abeg, let them know that once they buy something from you, even if it’s not to their liking, they should drink water on top.
Tip 4 – PRICE:
Dear reader, you would agree with me that the purpose of every businessman is to make profits and maximize same. So this right here is a hack, worked for centuries, if you ask me (chuckles). Fix your price according to the customers. Omo, this country is tough as it is, I see no reason why you should sell the same leather jacket you sold to Balqees for 8k to Keesmuah for the same price. I mean, judging by Keesmuah’s Instagram posts, she must be loaded and obviously would get it for 30k without bargaining. It’s a lifetime opportunity, darling. Do your thing!She no kuku sabi you na abi? Hian!
Tip 5 – RELATIONSHIP:
I see no reason why you should draw curtains. I mean, if you make your customer your best friend, there is nothing wrong with it. To be honest, such customer would be thrilled to know how good your partner treats you. Create no boundaries. It builds trust.
Tip 6 – CONNECTIONS AND NETWORKING:
If you see someone who sells the same item as you do, be sure never to cross paths with the person, it is a very dangerous move!Urghh! I mean…why? Please, if you sell clothes, make sure you build a community of painters as your network. It will make your brand grow, get better, and this is backed with proof.
Tip 7 – DELIVERY:
It is one thing to go through the stress of getting orders, it is anotherwahalato delivero. Dear vendor, in addition to Bubu, don’t allow any customer stress your life. Deliver only as your mood commands.
Tip 8 – ADVERTISEMENT:
Only big companies run ads, and ads on TVs are the best. That Tayo’s TC with 5k viewers is just a waste of money. Wait till you are big.
Tip 9 – CONSISTENCY:
With the way this country is, is  the government consistent? So why must you? I am just saying, things might take a toll on your health. With all therogbodiyanin this country, you should at least try and rest seven days a week and think ofjapaplans only. It is therapeutic, dear CEO.
Tip 10 – GIVEAWAYS:
Giveaways are done by rich people and no one should expect same from you. Give freebies from the little profit you earn? No! That’s crazy! You are not Don Jazzy and nobody should expect any free things from you. You are not Darosa.
That said, if you have it at the back of your mind that customers are always right this millennia, unlearn it! Not in this century, my dear."
"Fellow Nigerian Students, ASUUn as You Read This…",https://punocracy.com/fellow-nigerian-students-asuun-as-you-read-this/,2022-03-08T15:34:30+01:00,"by: Jonathan Ukor
Fellow Nigerian students, as soon as you read this, it is not too late to consider a career path that does not require a university degree. You may decide to venture into the“crowd-pleaser”business, either as a motivational speaker, a pastor, or an entertainer. I hear these people are racking in millions of naira with each cheers and each Amens. Or even better, you may merge all three and become another version of the liquid metal,“the Indaboski Bahose”. Whatever you decide, understand that waiting for the FGN or ASUU iswaiting for Godot.
And if you are indecisive, a more studious decision would be to read up the volumes of all your course work. Comrade, you can do that, right?! Here are a few reasons why waiting for the FGN or ASUU is importantly-irrelevant:
(I) Nigerian lecturers need a break
If you closely observed your lecturers and the intensity of last semester’s assignments and exams, you don’t need an oracle to reveal the burden upon them. This burden may be physical, spiritual, (or intellectual). The only way they can vent their frustration is to douse students in assignments, back-to-back hits. Quiz questions such as:“Critically analyse the value of education in a political system that devalues PhD holders and elevates O’level holders”and“Estimate the net worth in naira if the whole of Nigeria is sold to China”are more of psychological breakdown than academic teasers. Don’t blame your professors, though. Don’t blame ASUU either.
(II) The IPPIS scheme is innocently fraudulent
The FGN were ill-informed. They thought our professors only cared for shelfing best-selling books in their personal libraries and Nobel prize-winning papers in their portfolio. They actually believed our lecturers had zero needs for money in their bank accounts. Who would have thought that lecturers have concerns for wealth? One would assume that, due to their passion for academic excellence andprobitas-doctrina, the academia should not bother about salary increment — after all, the rewards for teachers are stored in heavenly mansions.
Being misinformed, the FGN innocently proposed the IPPIS scheme to appease our beloved immaterial lecturers. The FGN must have overestimated the ludicrousness of these seasoned and avid academia. However,“extant studies”reveal that the IPPIS is a monumental fraud. No wonder, ASUU in conjunction with her league of professors and strategists devised the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS),(aka. Made-by-Nigeria fiscal scheme), to replace the IPPIS.
Realising their ingenuity, the FGN fear that education will drive Nigeria into bankruptcy, not corruption. They thus subjected UTAS to a number of integrity tests to certify if this home-made scheme is truly efficient. Despite positive results, the FGN chose to play the delay-tactics game. ASUU got tagged and is eager to play too.
(III) Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, …
In these series of strike actions, neither the FGN nor ASUU is the villian. They both want what is best for us, the Nigerian students.Right?!Since neither is culpable, the FGN has recently announced an inauguration ceremony of the Re-negotiation Committee to try to address the current strike issues.
It has become a pattern in Nigeria, in that there is always a negotiation to support the previous negotiations, followed by another negotiation to counter the re-negotiation, and a re-negotiation to test the efficacy of future negotiations. Until the FGN can successfully outsmart ASUU in one of these many (re)negotiations, there is no telling of the end of these sporadic strikes.
The negotiation meetings and ad-hoc committees are becoming very exhausting (lucrative, I mean). It is now difficult to explain the functions of the Minister of Labour and Employment from those of the Minister of Education. DoesMallam Dr Adamu Ngigereally understand the joys and progressiveness of young people studying in Nigeria? Do the FGN really read the education situation in Nigeria, the way Nigerian students read for an 8AM exam? I wonder.
(IV) Leaders of today vs. Leaders of tomorrow
ASUU may have discovered that the leaders of tomorrow are those (we) studying in Nigeria, while the leaders of today are those studying abroad. Did you know (of course, you do), that since 1999 there have been more ASUU strikes in Nigeria than lightning strikes. Only in the years 2000, 2004, 2012, and 2014 – 2016, did ASUU not declare a nationwide strike. Even during the pandemic, there was an ASUU strike — like an endemic vibing with a pandemic.(Madd o!)
Thisdis-regard for education in Nigeria is factored by the fact that ASUU has tired out on educating the leaders of tomorrow. It is a futile effort, after all. Reports show that Nigerians have a strong drive to study abroad, as nearly 100,000 Nigerian students enrolled to study abroad in the year 2020 alone. This is brilliant — a strategy tojapafor the duration of your study abroad and within that time you metamorphose from being a leader of tomorrow into a leader of today.
This satire is overstretched. Gleaning on these reasons, Nigerian students can bask in the hopes that the FGN and ASUU offer. The future is as bright as the Green-white-green flag.
Shalom."
"‘Oga, This is No Ottawa’: A Letter to My Governorship Aspirant",https://punocracy.com/oga-this-is-no-ottawa-a-letter-to-my-governorship-aspirant/,2022-03-06T09:10:54+01:00,"By: Judah Bamigboye
It was amidst the intense politicking for the governorship ticket of a major party in a south-western state that an aspirant barged into my quiet suburb within the state. Flustered and embittered, he began a tirade, wailing against what he called the “nairanization” of our political system. This suave and urbane millennial had recently relocated from the Ottawa, Canada, to “salvage his native state from the doldrums.”
“Can you believe my uncles and aunties simply told me off, asking me what they stood to gain from my victory? They even told me I had no godfather, had not visited my state in years, and I was unwilling to drop money for empowerment,” he railed.
“Oga, this is no Ottawa,” I responded, deciding to tutor him on the nuances of electioneering in Nigeria, especially in a clime punctuated by recession and inflation.
Election periods in Nigeria are a time flowing with milk and honey, but it isn’t that simple. For my millennial friend, it was all about coming back home, brandishing his barrage of certificates from Harvard and pontificating on how he was going to transform his state into an agricultural-technological model that rivals that of the American state of New York or the Canadian State of Ottawa. But that is not how we win elections in Nigeria.
First, election is all about money. Spending money is a basic nuance in every election cycle. But in Nigeria, you must have more than enough, from your own purse. If you are coming from a Utopian society like Ottawa, where several ideological think thanks and PACs rise in defence of your “lofty” ideas and decide to raise millions of dollars … Well, not in our dear Nigeria.
When you see support groups rising in your defence and drafting all sorts of flattering press statements “forcing” or “threatening” you to run, then you have to understand that money has exchanged hands. They might even offer to pay for your nomination form. Don’t be too impressed. You have only been loaned. Expect to pay back with interests. These support groups need not have an ideological base or a well-known mantra. All they need are branded shirts, well oiled media machinery, and organizing capacities that appeal to your political aspirations. If you are generous enough with funds, a group of 10 members can organize a ten million man-march for you across every state of the federation, preaching of your paradisal candidacy that must not be ignored.
To the millennial governorship aspirant from Ottawa, in your state and counties, you must have been used to and motivated by how candidates sashay from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, shirts rolled up, taking the trains, exchanging handshakes, smiles and even light kisses with other men’s wives. They board the trains, pontificate about a new Canada. No guns. No aides. No accoutrement of political majesty. All is simplicity, shorn of grandiosity. Before you get here, understand our style is different.
Although the Nigeria you left for greener pastures had few, dilapidated rail systems at the very risk of total collapse, you must have been motivated by the cheering news of the several rail lines being constructed and in use. Except that nobody has told you that rail lines are now being bombarded by thieves, renegades, and kidnappers who are only interested in fleecing you, in cash and in body. In case you decide to campaign on rail, please there is simply no beauty in simplicity. Hire your bodyguards. They have to be in every corner, watching every move and shielding you from every loving voter. And please, do not try to hug or kiss any woman on the campaign train. If you do, her husband standing next to her could land you a very hot slap. The newspaper headline“Chaos as man slaps governorship aspirant for kissing wife”would do no good to your ambitions.
For deciding to leave the glee and bliss of your adopted state of Ottawa to salvage your home country, threegbosafor you. However, for believing you could just breeze through the labyrinths of electoral process, without structures and molecules in place, three punches for you. In Nigeria, when you hear political structure, it has nothing to do with the sane, clear-cut mechanisms in place to win an election. Structures are human beings, the army of men and women, boys and girls (yes, ask them in Kano),okadariders, village heads, prophets and prophetesses that dominate the lowest rung of the political ladder. They control the membership of the units and wards. Their allegiances shift like the sinking sand. And only a combination of money, money, and money can keep them, tied to your side, at least till the day of election.
Ward meetings have no similarity to your county debates or agenda setting meetings in Ottawa. A ward meeting is an opportunity for you to meet the “stakeholders” and show them your level of commitment to the cause. Oh, need I remind you that for every hailing of“Incoming, My Governor, No shaking!“, you are expected to let something go from your pocket. So I advise: ensure you keep your speech as short as possible, so that you won’t have to drop your whole cash at hand during that meeting.
Is the Nigerian political system different from where you are coming from? Absolutely yes. But are the values over there totally useless here in our national politics? Absolutely not.
We are a nation of grammarians, and social media intelligentsias, who pontificate on intricate political dynamics through the instrumentality of social media. Finish up the spending on the polling units, but ensure you have a social media presence. Polish the social media army with your arcane knowledge of space investments and socio-technological transmogrification. They will hail, laud, flatter and advertise you to high heavens, through tweets, trends and friends. Aside occasional giveaways, do not get carried away. Nine out of ten of these millennials do not have voters cards, let alone vote during elections. In Ottawa, you might not be able to afford losing the social media battle. Here, you can lose it all over again. Just ensure you don’t lose the polling unit war. Enter your helmet of victory: Money, structure, and money.

"Perish those Thoughts, Dear Nigerian Naira",https://punocracy.com/perish-those-thoughts-dear-nigerian-naira/,2022-03-06T08:52:51+01:00,"By: Moghalu Chinwendum Jennifer
There was a time when you were a big deal that even the US Dollars had nothing on you. Naira, you had a good thing going,kai!I mean, apart from the fact that you are sprayed in the air like insecticide by the same persons who enacted laws prohibiting anyone from doing same (how else do you expect them to show the world that they have arrived, eh?). You are often crumpled and shoved into pockets and bags; often found in the waste bin, torn and rejected. No wonder the Nigerian economy came down with depression – who can handle the amount of rejection you have had to handle since the start of your existence. In fact, the only time I have ever seen you not crumpled is when you slide out through the ATM or I make an over-the-counter withdrawal. Well, who is to blame? You did sell yourself short. Deal with it.
Poor Naira! I’m sending you lots of love and light because I know that even though you go about like you do not give a hoot about your current situation, under the surface, you secretly think that one day you will take your place again in the world, regain your respect and chill with the big boys (or currencies). If you do nurse those thoughts, though, do perish them. It will never happen!
One has got to dream realistic dreams! You are hoping for the impossible. Come on Naira, have you not seen your state? You are trampled upon during occasions ,you stink and you are often used as a writing scroll. Do not let these motivational speakers deceive you, dear. It is all over for you.
Can we talk about the elephant in the room? Naira, you are valueless! The more your value reduces, the more our exceedingly insightful leaders and statesmen, God bless their souls, reach and implement decisions to devalue you some more. What do you expect from them, eh? When your mates were hustling to remain relevant, what were you doing? Now, three thousand units of you cannot make a good pot ofegwusisoup at the very least and you still do nurse unrealistic dreams?Tufiakwa!
Your plight is hopeless, dear Nigerian Naira. Even the Ghanaian Cedi, Ethiopian Birr and Kenyan Shilling have topped you on the money league table!You no dey shame?The Five and Ten Naira note-denominations are the worst. They are not even regarded as money any longer, because they could not even purchase any tangible commodity. They are on life support and will soon go extinct.
Do not get your hopes up. It is all over for you. When your buddy, the Kobo,was taking blows ,you should have taken a hint. You took a sabbatical and now you seek to top the currency table. Just tell me how this makes sense.
Your glory is irredeemable, dear Nigerian Naira. Our leaders, our earthly saviours, solemnly having our best interests in mind, would always implement policies to devalue you. Don’t mindoleCharlie Soludo with his“Soludoic”solutions.E think say e dey wise. During his leadership at the Central Bank, when he contemplated revaluation of you, who was he trying to impress? After all, Kingsley Moghalu still believes that a weaker currency is better for an economy that wants to be competitive in the international market. They say that the Chinese Yen passed through and today, the currency is strong in international financial markets. Learn, Naira, learn!
But Naira, no matter how much you might be devalued, your worth shall always be deemed overvalued. When exactly would we have thestrong-economy-through-devaluationtheory be achieved this our Naija? Let me make it clear to you. You are just a plaything to the forces of the international market. Everybody knows that for a country that heavily relies on importation of necessities like food and petroleum, devaluation of our currency will most likely not favour us.
We have chosen poverty, exorbitantly high cost of living, unemployment, inflation and its attendant vices over crowning you with value. Yes, instead of diversifying the Nigerian economy and increasing production of goods and services so that the GDP will improve,  we would continue to treat you with scorn and mockery.Who you epp?You do not deserve value; know this and know peace.

To Love a Nigerian Witch,https://punocracy.com/to-love-a-nigerian-witch/,2022-03-03T16:59:08+01:00,"by: Dhee Sylvester
PREFACE
The secret to loving a Nigerian witch has been closely guarded by the Nigerian Guild of Exorcists since the amalgamation of the country in  1914. As a Nigerian man who has experienced the principalities and powers of Nigerian witches at an intimate level, this study is meant to enlighten those seeking to follow the same suicidal path.
However, to avoid any contextual misconceptions, a Nigerian witch is not, and should never be mistaken, as a Nigerian woman. While the Nigerian woman and the Nigerian witch are both female, a Nigerian witch differs in manner and motive from the average Nigerian woman.
The Nigerian woman is an endangered specie, and the ascent of Nigerian witches has been directly responsible for this decline. But still, to be loved by a Nigerian woman is one of the great pleasures of life, and if you are lucky enough to find one, it’s best you never lose her.
Before we proceed, it’s important to note that the experiences contained in this study are derived from my own personal encounters, along with anecdotes and confessions garnered from years of extensive research and interviews with men who have been victims of Nigerian witches.
SECTION ONE
For a man to love a Nigerian witch it is expected that he suffers from theWoman WrappaSyndrome. TheWoman WrappaSyndrome is a chronic behavioural disorder which reduces a man to a simpleton obsessed with pandering to women.
TheWoman WrappaSyndrome encompasses the unholy trident of denial, delusion, and desire. This means one of the most essential cognitive pedestals you must attain to love a Nigerian witch requires you to never accept she’s a witch, even when the fact she is persistently pokes you in the eye.
The delusion aspect of theWoman WrappaSyndrome operates in two folds. The first fold makes you believe your selfless and unconditional love can redeem a Nigerian witch from her diabolic ways, while the second fold demands you hold all the men she’s ever dated accountable for turning her into a witch.
This means you must fully dedicate yourself to her as a way of making amends for the war crimes of her exes. You must be willing to do this even if you have to denounce yourself as a man. When she takes you for granted and cheats on you with every man who winks at her, you must convince yourself that apologising to her is the best way to save your relationship.
The third aspect of theWoman WrappaSyndrome, which is desire, refers to the mental-set whereby a man’s sexual and emotional expectations makes him idolize his partner beyond reason. Your desires for her would have you constantly reminding yourself that to gain her affection, you must enjoy being the wipe she cleans her butt with.
It doesn’t matter if, two weeks after your relationship becomes official, you find out the man she calls her father is actually her Sugar Daddy, or that she chews the debris she picks out of her nostrils, or that she snores like a hippopotamus on heat. You must interpret your ability to tolerate these inconveniences as a way of proving you deserve to have her in your life.
SECTION TWO
A Nigerian witch can get away with things like not picking her calls or ignoring your messages, especially when she’s around one of her many suitors. You must accept her promiscuity with pride in your heart, and even encourage her to sleep with other men if doing so will make her give you a crumb of her divine attention.
A Nigerian witch always has men she strings along in parallel relationships, and she incentivizes this puppet show with the prospect of sex or marriage. Her decision on whom to marry often depends on which of the men she views as a long-term poverty eradication plan and the ones she considers as merely short-term orgasm donors.
But unlike her, you do not have such privileges, and you must answer her call at all times to avoid being accused of infidelity. A Nigerian witch doesn’t care if you are addressing the United Nations General Assembly or closing a business deal with the world’s richest man. When she gives you a call, she expects you to pick it before she even dials your number.
When she calls to hear your voice because she’s missing you, it’s important that you blush like an uncircumcised mosquito, while also pretending you don’t expect the call to end abruptly. When a Nigerian witch calls you, the call never exceeds three seconds, or at most, three and half seconds. Speaking at length when she calls a man makes her feel too nice, and a Nigerian witch will sooner grow horns than be caught being too nice to a man.
Once the call drops though, you must call her back immediately. As the hopeless romantic that you are, you must resist the temptation to think you are being manipulated when she tells you she ran out of airtime.
You must understand that a Nigerian witch wouldn’t be a witch if she calls you without needing something from you. As a good boyfriend, don’t ask why she only remembers to call you when she doesn’t have airtime; promise her you will send her some airtime instead.
Appreciate her false gratitude when she declares you are the best, by using the opportunity to reemphasize your undying love for her. Keep in mind that when a Nigerian witch says you are the best, what she really means is that you are the best in her rogue gallery of fools.
Do not feel bad about this, because the whole point of being in love is a momentary dance on the podium of foolishness. A Nigerian witch understands this truth, and unlike the horny men who litter her inbox on social media with I-love-you messages, she’s clever enough to exploit the benefits of making these men believe she’s also in love with them.
Sometimes, a Nigerian witch will take on the personality of a Nigerian woman, especially within the first few weeks of your relationship. This is not because she desires to actually become a good partner, but as part of a Ponzi-scheme to ensnare you into catching feelings you will later find difficult to outgrow.
SECTION THREE
Contrary to stereotype, the average Nigerian witch is not a short black female with a temperament closer to the ground than her knees. A Nigerian witch comes in all heights and widths, and her skin tone merely serves as a veneer of distinction.
If she is dark-skinned, then she’s more likely to be found in church on a Sunday morning than at a strip club on a Friday night. This is because dark-skinned Nigerian witches are often more covert than light-skinned Nigerian witches. Regardless, the vast majority of light- skinned Nigerian witches lack basic survival skills, struggle with intelligent conversations, and are as good in bed as Nigerian politicians are honest.
The other sub-group of Nigerian witches who have become the face of the coven, are usually gender egalitarians who believe it’s their destiny to inherit the Iron Throne of the Queen of Sheba. These group of witches are the type who go to fancy restaurants with a wallet full of nothing but entitlement and audacity.
The gender egalitarian Nigerian witch is often the kind of faux intellectual who engages in performatory outrage on social media. Being a gender egalitarian for a Nigerian witch usually stops and starts with whatever her favourite gender egalitarian does or says, which wouldn’t be a totally bad thing, if it didn’t also include whatever her favourite gender egalitarian wouldn’t even dare say or do.
As a man, being in love with a gender egalitarian is like having your penis chopped-off just so you can fellate yourself whenever you are horny. To maintain this abusive relationship, you need an unquantifiable amount of painkillers, sleeping pills, and antidepressants. This kind of relationship is a one-way road trip to hell with the man being both the car and its driver.
A gender egalitarian Nigerian witch would ruin your life with the same energy she uses to denigrate men on social media. If by some phenomenal stroke of luck, you are able to eventually break free from her spell, you should desist from attempting to reason with her, or appeal to her sensibilities, because she will only sum you up as a misogynist seeking to rape her. To a gender egalitarian Nigerian witch, the only thing worse than being a misogynist is being a human born with a penis.
If she has a huge following online or is fairly popular within your social circle, then your reputation is as dead as Abacha’s libido the moment you dare to think you can breakup with her. Prepare to be accused of rape for not replying her Whatsapp messages, or for wanting to experience true love with someone who doesn’t make you feel ashamed for having a penis.
Falsely accusing a man of rape is the go-to weapon for most Nigerian witches, because it allows them play victim, and enables them label anyone who dares to interrogate the merit of their claims as a rape apologist. When a gender egalitarian Nigerian witch says all men are potential rapists, don’t try to be reasonable by asking her if the statement includes her father, uncles, brothers, nephews, and son.
The best thing to do when in a relationship with a gender egalitarian Nigerian witch is to either tender yourself in absolute submission to her will, or you do the more honourable thing by faking your own death. If you choose to fake your own death, it will provide you with sympathetic immunity from her list of men who are either scum or trash.
But as much as the gender egalitarian Nigerian witch is a mode of deviants who have become prevalent since the advent of social media, they are still a minority within the ever growing fraternity of the Nigerian Witchcraft Association. The Nigerian Witchcraft Association is a coven of ebony beauties whose primary aim is to observe when a Nigerian man is happy and doing well, just so they can put an immediate end to the nonsense.
These witches are not always a product of abuse or oppression, but more often than not, are merely narcissists incapable of love. They are usually the type who would refuse dating a man because of the position of the moon on the day he was born, and who would justify their own toxic behaviours using the same reason.
SECTION FOUR
Breaking up with a Nigerian witch is never easy, and you will need twice the amount of courage it takes to date one. A Nigerian witch can’t be heartbroken, because she has her  heart neatly tucked away in a fridge somewhere she can’t remember. If she starts to cry when you tell her you want out of the relationship, do not be deceived by her tears, because you only did what she was planning to do to you.
Most times though, a Nigerian witch would reject your attempt to break up with her. This is not because she genuinely cares about you, but because she’s unwilling to lose the privileges and benefits that comes with dating you, as well as the control she has over your emotions. Even when she earns a six-figure salary and doesn’t need a man to take care of her needs, a Nigerian witch is never fulfilled until she has a man in her life she can torment.
If in the instance she claims to understand why you want out of the relationship after urinating on your laptop and smashing your windscreen, be grateful that she’s at least willing to let you go. However, if in the instance she only lends you a few slaps without destroying anything else, being grateful is not enough. You must throw a party and invite your ancestors to celebrate your newfound freedom.
Never underestimate a Nigerian witch’s propensity for violence and aggression, because they are entitled Prima Donnas who believe the world hangs on their waist-beads. A Nigerian witch won’t hesitate to hit you when she’s angry, but she will call you a monster if you ever try to defend yourself from being assaulted.
If you send a Nigerian witch a romantic message or poem, do not assume she has read it. Even if she has, she will pretend she hasn’t because such gestures don’t impress her. Same applies to dinner dates and flowers. The only romantic gesture you can offer that she will enjoy is when you go bankrupt in your attempt to make her feel good. Anything other than this and you are merely wasting your time.
Finally, a Nigerian witch doesn’t date broke men; she only dates rich men because nothing excites her more than the prospect of marrying a billionaire so she can oppress those she considers beneath her. If you are a billionaire, you must accept the harsh reality that a Nigerian witch will never see you as a man, but rather as an ATM with a burdensome dildo attached.

Changing the Narratives: #ProcrastinatorsLivesMatter,https://punocracy.com/changing-the-narratives-procrastinatorslivesmatter/,2022-03-01T08:55:19+01:00,"By: Aiyelabegan Robiat Opeyemi
It is quite extraordinary the way we, the last minute people’s minds work. Yes, the tag because of our natural (usually not man-made) disposition to postponing tasks to the last minute and still getting them done quite beautifully (anyways, for every general rule, there is always an exception). I digress. It is utterly amazing the way our minds work and we totally do not deserve the persecution from ordinary people especially “specialists” who have tagged us a special breed of lazy people. This assertion couldn’t be any false, I mean have you met us?!!Hardwork’s got nothing on us!
As a lifelong member of the coven andafter several postponements (of course),I have taken the pains and pleasure of compiling the beauty of the ways of the last minute people for the sheer purpose of sensitisation (these folks need to be educated). Nooo, I do not need to be praised. If I do not do it, who will?Others would procrastinate away, any way.
First, the excitement that comes with the pressure of delaying. I remember one time a panel thought I was crazy and was probably sugarcoating too much (usually a little bit of sugarcoating won’t hurt, employers expect it even) when I had told them that I loved working under pressure in response to their question of how to deal with it. Talk about“Ms. Aiyelabegan, should you get pressured a lot during the course of carrying out your duty, how do you intend on dealing with it?”My brother, pressure is not something I run away from, I crave it and by that, you could picture an individual addicted to caffeine.Like, pass me a jug of strong pressure, no sugar or cream please!
The heavy-tight feeling in your chest and trying to keep it cool at the same time? Whoosh, the mere thought of it could make me high.Now tell me o ye judges, what could be a better recipe to excel?I mean we’re born for this success ting!
Also, the spontaneity of our actions, most times, is beautiful. It’s a moment of pride for every member of our tribe when they see truly how good they are. To be brilliant is a thing but to embody a whole lot of amazing ideas which seems to be endless and manifest them is on another wave-length.Like, where does it end??! These beautiful nonstop ideas are from me? Pretty tell o ye wise one, will I be the one to cure cancer? What other superpowers do I possess?
Now to think a whole lot of people think we’re just a bunch of unserious fellows who would rather bear themselves set on fire than to timely lift their fingers? Think again, my dears!
Furthermore, imagine getting a “B” in an assignment you ran shotgun on same as your class’ smartest kid who is known for her extra-studying skills and stellar academic achievements? Ladies and gentlemen, trust me, the feeling is unparalleled. You’ll be like;I knew it! I’m not on the same level with these people! Who knew what would have happened if I had actually studied?!!And that’s the cue your subconscious needs. It begins to go on and on about how spectacular you are and how your brilliancy isn’t deserved by the peasant school you’re in. You’re the best person out there, if you only you wanted to show it! What could be better than affirmations from your inner self?! What??
I still await your very unconvincing answer!
More so, the last minute people are, by nature, very contented humans. By this, I mean the much older and ‘conservative’ and not theJohnny-Just-Comes, who expect “A” results in gigs that they’ve put in” C” games but by their sheer brilliance and get “B” results.My fren, why is your face like that? Noo, come of it.We do not do that here. Here, we accept results and mueve.
Again, I digress. It’s quite interesting how un-ambitious we are. I mean we put in enough work to be good, not extra good but just the right amount. Sometimes ago, in my institution, I had to make a presentation on behalf of my group to the whole class. We had a lecturer from another university present and I had not even perused the content of the paper at all yet I was all cool and calm. As a last-minute queen that I am, I knew I was going to ace it and I did just that. Maybe not amazingly well, but just the right and enough stuff. You know what I mean?
That makes us the perfect set of humans for you to take as your friends. We won’t overshadow you, or steal your shine. We’ll just do our thing the way we know best.You sef think am now.
Brethren, I hope that you’ve learnt your lesson and know better than to treat procrastination like leprosy and the last minute people like irresponsible folks. You know better now, we are humans and we deserve some empathy too. Our mental health matters! Extend kindness to a last minute person today!"

You have made begging an art, a trade, an excuse.
You walk up to me at the bus stop all dressed up. Shirt, tie and all. I listen to you because you look serious. Even sound important. Your English is clean. Your cologne, inviting. Few seconds in and it is clear you are a damn good storyteller. Your themes are like the stars above at night. A wallet got lost in the bus. You took the wrong bus and ended up in this strange place. You have not had anything to eat all day. You will appreciate a little token.
Mister corporate beggar, what if you are stranded at the same place, every day?
Your stories like the weather keep changing. The next day, you will narrowly miss the person you came all the way to see on the Island and you will need just some little change to get back home. The day after, your car will develop a slight fault down the road and you had left your ATM card at home…
What if the stories are not so convincing, so capable of milking out mercy from even the meanest of minds?  What if they were not fiction, pure fiction, steeped in undiluted hilarity?
What if instead, you found yourself a real job, likeerm ermselling these stories to Nollywood?
What if you wrote them into short stories and published them as vignettes and hawked them in the Lagos traffic? What if you tried out stand-up comedy instead or became a salesman convincing people to buy insurance policies they cannot understand?
How much longer would you stay exploiting the goodwill of good Samaritans?
What if not every Samaritan is good?
What if I told you I am looking at how to grab the much you have, off yousef? That beneath the façade of this dry-cleaned shirt I have on is a mountain of needs of my own. Bills unpaid. Rent that is late. Loans overdue. Dreams now so deferred they look like nightmares.
What if…?
I met your kind, your clones at the airport the other day.
One of them whispered as he frisked me on the tarmac. An onlooker would have thought that he was wishing me a safe flight.Oga you know sey na weekend, anything for di boys? That was what he whispered in my ear. The meaning was not lost on me. The nauseating feeling made me sigh as my mind did a double back flip to the other fellow in like uniform who just seconds ago at the security check-in, asked me the very same question in an attempt at some kind of quid pro quo.
Frozen tomato paste is not allowed on a local flight, he had said with a note of finality regarding the well wrapped packaged in my checked in bag. But he was going to allow my luggage pass anyway.Such a good guy you would think. He smiled a knowing smile, like he had just absolved me of all my sins. Still reeling from shock, I smiled back in gratitude. His next statement sent me back into shock. It was more of a demand than a question,Oga anything for di boys?
What if there is nothing for di boys?
What if you just did your job the way you ought to and not expect anything in return?
In a different setting, another such fellow is flipping through my passport. His hands are moving but his eyes are not reading the pages. It is his lips that are at work instead, complimenting my shirt, asking what I came back with, reminding me what day of the week it was. He was begging, cajoling me to part with some dollars, subtly threatening me with unjustified delays if I did not play ball.
What if my papers were forged? What if I was entering the country illegally? What if my cargo was arms or hard drugs, or fake medicines? So, you will turn a blind eye once, something drops for di boys?
What if…? Never mind.
I am looking at you as you tell your dog-eared story about being stranded, your hand running through your well-kept hair and scratching at nothing. Yourmy brotherhelp me in the name of Godmakes me wonder if God has a sense of humor, if He is amused as I am by your trickery, by your subsidized cleverness in His name. I make like I did not hear you nor see the look of entitlement on your face as I walk along. Yes, I know it is weekend but No, I made no plans whatsoever for di boys."
We should all be Buharists,https://punocracy.com/we-should-all-be-buharists/,2022-02-24T12:23:31+01:00,"By: Faridat Musa
Buharism: The socio-political and economic ideology of Nigerian President and former military head of state, Muhammadu Buhari.
We, Buharists, are the most misunderstood people on earth.
Our religion is focused on ensuring multi-sectorial failure, war against progressive economic policies, cattle and nomadic affairs, and entertaining insecurity and terrorist integration. These are the agenda Buhari has dedicated the last six years to achieving. It is the first time a sitting president will centre these four major areas of concern.
We strive to emulate the actions of our supreme leader’s companions and the inactions of our leader to a faultless precision. That is the only way to be an exemplary follower of the movement. To be a Buharist is to always choose mediocrity, defend this mediocrity, and revel in it even when it threatens your own life.
No sort of criticism is tolerated by us. I particularly approve of the detainment of ill-wishers of this administration. This was the end-game for those zealous anti-SARS protesters. Buhari halted their plans quickly, you should do the same too.
When well-researched evidence is presented before you, implicating Buhari in murder crimes he was complicit in, you must deny it. Even when it appears seemingly undeniable, deny it still. As an addition, tell them it is a mere figment of their imagination. Case in point, Lekki massacre.
Our power begins where that of the DSS ends; we scavenge for anti-buharists online and on-site and deal with them. We are crass and vicious people and proudly so. Anyone who is openly critical of Buhari is for unconstitutional removal of our lord and saviour. Can you now see how this is a personal attack?
You must not permit anyone to make you feel like Buhari has not done enough for Nigeria. From whatever direction they come at you, hit them with the best counter you have. Buhari is the best thing to ever happen to Nigeria as an entity and Nigerians as a people.
Buhari may not have created 5,000,000 jobs but his socialist schemes are enough to go round. If anyone disagrees, count the schemes and name themmoni by moni.If they fail to see how this empowers citizens, then that is a result of their deficiency in basic economics. Should you educate them? You can try.
His anti–corruption agenda has shown impressive results. He tackles corruption head-on, not poverty, no substandard education and healthcare, but corruption. This is because corruption is the root of all evil. Today, thanks to this approach, Nigeria no longer ranks 44th on the Corruption Perception Index list. We have finally made it to Top 35. As he enforces this agenda, he allows his people a share of the national cake; he is fighting corruption, not them.
Change is constant but ours is rooted in stagnation; we grow by promoting regression. As part of outdated plans to revamp the economy and encourage patronage of local brands, Buhari closed our international borders in 2019. This evidence-based decision may be one of the best actions our government has taken. China attempted that in the late 90s, now look where they are today. When our international borders were shut, remember how well we flourished? Now he has moved onto greater concerns like building rice pyramids in 2022.
The next card they usually pull is Boko Haram and rising insecurity. And that has no bearing with The General; the instability is fuelled by some political actors to create distrust in our minds. Can’t you see how he pampers the terrorists?
He showers them with attention, newly sewn attire, and a welcoming party. It does not matter the number of people you have killed, raped, and displaced. Come to Buhari, he always has a Sheda for you and his tailor never disappoints. The rationale is, an appeased group of terrorists paves way to safer communities. Is that not good old wisdom?
If they remind you that the naira-dollar exchange rate which was 150 naira when our leader assumed office has now risen to nearly 500 despite his promise of returning it to $1-₦1 exchange rate, remind them that Buhari was military president at a time when a naira was exchanging for $2. He knows what he is doing, it is not just obvious to the loathing eyes yet. He will deliver on that promise soon. In the likely event that dream fails to materialize, never forget that PDP did worse.
Any other ailing sector they mention, remind them that Buhari has provided infrastructure. If they say public schools and hospitals are in dilapidated states, tell them Buhari built railway from Lagos to Ibadan. If they say doctors and lecturers are perpetually embarking on strike, tell them he built a railway from Abuja to Kaduna. If they say the inflation rate is skyrocketing, tell them he is planning to gift us the 2nd Niger Bridge. If they tell you that federal highways are death traps, tell them he is currently seeking loans to connect Nigeria to Niger Republic by railway.
A time will arrive when people will tell you you are too much. You must embrace this excessiveness and own it. They say to us buharists, you can be loyal but not too much. You can defend him but not to the point of stupidity. But I say to you, all these are tools of censorship. We are a people without limit and shame.
You are a victim, not of our leader’s ineptitude, but of people’s criticism of him. That is your motivation to denounce everyday Nigerian problems viciously with false comparisons. Jesus and his disciples were persecuted unjustly based on malicious lies and betrayal. If you cannot see any correlation yet, take your time to reflect deeply.
When public persecution prompts you to draw parallels and perceive some logic in what they say. You will contemplate not outsourcing your thoughts to Buhari’s flock and utilizing your brain for once. But stay firm! BMC, Pọnmọ boys, or whatever they call us shall not faze you.
(No part of this work is fictitious. It is all based on interactions with Buharists and direct inferences from those discussions.)"
The excesses of servitude,https://punocracy.com/the-excesses-of-servitude/,2022-02-22T13:08:49+01:00,"By: Moses Ameh
Being a despot in Africa is arguably the best job on our planet. I would have said universe but I have to be wary of that innate human hubris which may prove suicidal in the eons to come that makes us assume we are the only sentient beings in the universe or multiverse as the case may be. It is this potentially self-destructive attribute that inspires titles likeMiss UniverseorCraziest Dictator Alive. Such audacious conclusions! As far as the limits of our assumptions extend, there may exist in some lonely, deserted galaxy or on some cold, dark far flung dwarf planet, an iridescent inchoate beauty or an immortal, amorphous alien autocrat with qualities that surpass these human impostors.
The job of an African despot is tedious but lucrative. Despots get to attain God-like omnipotence and also acquire immunity from all bodily afflictions (in Western hospitals) and theft or human right violation probes. What’s more? Their loyal serfs have no limits for their tolerance which may last for generations depending on the despot’s own discretion. Charles Taylor’s 1997 election winning campaign slogan best exemplifies the nonexistent boundaries of this tolerance:
“He killed my Ma. He killed my Pa. He gets my vote.”
It is worthy of mention at this point that the African despot is not as untouchable as he/she seems. This should come as no surprise, considering how common it is to hear the saying: “Nothing is as it seems.” Icebergs best portray this concept. Their often ostensibly small appearance has proven waterloo for many who take their face value and ignore their subsurface magnitude. In order to prevent this titanic error, I have, after much effort, successfully exposed these seemingly inconspicuous rivals of the African despot. For this act of service, the African despot owes me a Swiss account robust with taxpayers money.
The first and least of these rivals are the domestic abusers who are beautifully characterized in Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus, the medical personnel who albeit inadvertently sever patients ureters during caesarean sections or administer drugs via the wrong route with impunity, the MP’s, Reps, Senators, whatever they are called, who refuse salary and allowance reviews that better reflect their civil royalty status. This hierarchy is subject to review. The arch-rival, however, whose position is non-negotiable and who can easily topple the despots are the Men of God. On this, I can go no further because I hear a voice saying:“Touch not this subject and do not lampoon my prophet.”
Rivals aside, it is imperative to state that this job like other jobs has its peculiar occupational hazards which can thankfully be mitigated. Here are some hazards and the actions African despots take to protect themselves:
1. LOSS OF REVERENCE:
There are three tools that are invaluable to the African despot and indeed all other despots across the globe and beyond: from Minsk to Pyongyang to that far flung dwarf planet. These include:
i. Demagoguery.
ii. The barrel of a loaded gun: the prime purveyor and protector of democracy.
iii. The often forgotten but nonetheless important butt of the gun.
Demagoguery:
Of the three tools mentioned, this is perhaps the most important for getting the despot into office and maintaining smooth control of affairs for the first few or more years or tenures (for there are indeed honourable despots who obey the constitution, holding free and fair selections at stipulated times). By any means, the previous statement is not intended to understate the value of the barrel which has efficiently served not a few despots in their quest for ascendancy. Rather, it is meant to extol the versatility of demagoguery as a tool. This tool is praise-worthy because be they from the barracks, hills or jungles, those who attain power by mere coercive might still employ demagoguery and populist rhetoric in consolidating power. As I suppose you have rightly guessed, these ‘unprecedented’ tactics enthrall their loyal, messiah deprived serfs who go berserk, desperate to only but touch the hem of the despot’s garment. The tyrant then indulges them, placing pictures of himself on large billboards, sitting statues of her own likeness in parks, schools and secretariats, naming boulevards after himself etc, etc. The despot is well aware that out of sight is out of mind. As the hunger for reverence intensifies, the despot who unlike the supreme cannot raise stones to complement his diet, may exhaust his source, become reckless and lose the common touch.
The butt and barrel of the loaded gun:
Verily, I say unto you, it was easier for Pilate to wash his hands and allow the torture and execution of the Christ than it is for despots to order the use of the butt and barrel of the loaded gun on their irreverent serfs. As is usually the case, these despots suffer the harrowing experience of taking these necessary, invariably selfless decisions. The nightmares and sleepless nights that follow are hellish but what can they do? It is no fault of theirs that the irreverent serfs took the path of peaceful protest, even the Almighty has himself made special provisions for the impertinent soul. However, criminal elements especially terrorists have no reason to fear the butt and barrel which  for them double as the rod and staff of comfort. Besides, these despots are God fearing and acknowledge the parables of the lost sheep and prodigal son as true and sacrosanct. For this reason, there is great rejoicing and lavish feasting whenever a terrorist accepts the huge financial amnesty package. This principle is also adopted in the civil service for good measure and in doing so, the despots have inadvertently scored a crucial point for democracy. How can that be? Well, the refusal to pay committed workers their due stipends and instead funding dubious social relief initiatives for the unemployed is a basic democratic tenet: majority over minority. Meanwhile, all hope is not lost for the irreverent peaceful protesters as they can still enter paradise if they suffer the trials and temptations of poverty, disease, etc as a test of their steadfast faith in the despot.
2. SUBSTITUTION:
Despots detest this the most. It is however inevitable and can occur by death or deposition.
Deposition:
Based on their responses to deposition, there are two species of the African despot. The first type believes in the divine right to rule for eternity. An example is Yahya Jammeh, the erstwhile president of The Gambia who had this to say:“How long you stay in power…does not determine your fate. It is what you do that determines your fate as far as I am concerned. But let me tell you one thing, my fate is in the hands of the Almighty Allah. I will continue to deliver to the Gambian people and if I have to rule this country for one billion years, I will.”
Wise words, you will agree. I mean, why run in a relay when you can run cross country alone? Clearly, fewer leaders stabilize a country because too many cooks spoil the broth. This means more work for the despot but he can still manage a couple extra ministerial portfolios e.g Petroleum or Mining or Solid minerals or whatever portfolio handles the resource that forms the ‘many’ commodity (diversified) economy because he can do all things through Allah who gives him strength to fulfill his divine mandate.
The second group comprises those who believe their time in power should only end when Elizabeth II hands over the English throne to Prince Charles. Mugabe was substituted and has died, never to see it happen. Beware Kagame! Her God is real, even the sun-king’s record reign is at stake.
Death:
For this, it is best to have French colony status. As Bongo Snr put it:“Gabon without France is like a car without a driver and France without Gabon is like a car without fuel.”What a great chauffeur France is! In addition to great driving, France has given Africa an emperor and several dynasties. It also offers direct Parent to Child transmission of public office. As an Igbo proverb loosely translates: when a road is good, people will love to take it more than once. Vive la France!
3. OBSCURITY:
It matters not the style of substitution, be it celebrated demise or unjust exile to comfort and niceties in Malabo or Harare or Paris, the despot is usually well prepared for this hazard. The trick is easy, give the loyal serfs something to span the ages, something memorable. It may come in the form of death or imprisonment of a disloyal ingrate, like Dele Giwa, Saro Wiwa, Solo Sandeng, Al Sadr, Khashoggi, Protasevich, Bobi Wine, Navalny or Abubakar Idris. It could even be more elaborate, a spectacle performed on an unforgettable stage such as Sharpeville, Tiananmen or Lekki. The grander, the better. Other than the aforementioned, the despot can hibernate in complascence, assured of a billion years of public service.

How to be a Nigerian Muslim Sister,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-nigerian-muslim-sister/,2022-02-21T11:43:00+01:00,"By: Abdulmalik Maryam Lolade
A lot of people have been so curious on how they can effectively navigate the terrain of being a Muslim sister in Nigeria. Muslim sisters in Nigeria are different from other Muslim sisters in the other parts of the globe.  Care to know what distinguishes them? Want to know how to be a recognized Muslim sister in Nigeria? Relax! You will soon find out through the effective and potent tips I do have for you.
1.Exchange of greetings
Exchange of greetings and pleasantries must only be with your co-Muslim sisters. This is the number one sister-code you must never breach and must always live up to. You want to exchange greetings with those who are not up to your level in “Sistership“?O fe blow ni?Awuzubillah! You cannot do that as a Muslim sister. Only ladies who adorn the Hijab are entitled to your greetings. Never must you make mistake of greeting the ones who just throw their veil over their heads.Kai!Always remember the word “Sister” is reserved for those who adorn themselves with the Hijab, not for “veil users.”
2.Public etiquette
Entering the same cab with guys is a taboo. Don’t even dare.  I repeat don’t! As a Muslim sister,  you are not expected to enter same means of transportation with the opposite sex.  In fact, if you are already in a cab and other passengers want to board same vehicle with you, especially if they are guys, you must alight my sister.  Do you want to stain your sisterhood?  No? Then you must alight wherever you are, even if you’ve been waiting for hours to get that cab under scorching sun.  Remember, heaven is the goal.
3.Iron not thy garment
Ironing is a crucial feature of the “never to-do” list of the Muslim Sister. Ironing of your clothing is a taboo. You must never do it. Do not even dare pressing your garment. You look more beautiful and decent in a neatly-rumpled dress. Ironing attracts the opposite gender see you in your beautiful form and you know that’s indecent. Hence, you must make sure never to iron any of your clothings even when you are to go for an interview. Decency must always be the watch-word.
4.Sneakers, the identity card
To complete the formalities of the Muslim sister dress etiquette, you must always rock your dressing with sneakers. What completes a sister’s dressing is nothing but a good pair of sneakers. When you put on your dress and complement it with sneakers, you don’t need any other verification, you are a in league with Muslim sisters already.
5.Rock that tote bag.
Yeah! You read that right.  You need to get a tote bag with your name beautifully inscribed on it preferably in Arabic. You may decide to use nicknames too like “Ummu Basma‘” or “Ummu Romlah,” amongst other pseudonyms. The tote bag is the perfect initiation symbol into the coveted realms of Muslim Sisterhood. Forget not.
6.Always exclaim in Arabic
When something of surprise or unexpected happenings happen, you must exclaim using Arabic wordings. What is OMG? Sister!Haba, O wrong nau. You must only utter words like“Subhanallah!” “Ya Rahman!.” Your goal isJannah,so you must always adhere to speaking the language of its inhabitants, yeah? Do not allow the wrong exclamations mess up your drip.
7.“Brotherlize” the opposite gender
The opposite gender must always be addressed as “Brother”. The Almighty has created them different from you for a reason, so you, the mortal, must always give credence to that difference. If you do have a male friend or colleague either in school or at work, then you must add brother to their respective names. How can you just call Abdullahgbagajust like that?  Common, that’s disrespectful to the sisterhood.
So,Jameelah, if you wannabambamor you wanna chill with the Nigerian Muslim Sisters, hence your reason of runningkitikiti dey run katakata, these tips are for you. You see how the thing goes, yeah? If these tips do not fall into your convenience, then you aren’t ready to be a Muslim Sister in9ja. Thank me not, I do these things for the hood.

How to be an aide to a Nigerian Big Man,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-an-aide-to-a-nigerian-big-man/,2022-02-19T12:01:59+01:00,"By: Sylva Nze Ifedigbo
To start with, your boss, the Nigerian big man, most likely owns a protruding, very concave abdomen, which advances before him like a near-term pregnancy when he walks. This is his cherished certificate of membership to the big men club. You are warned never to grow one. The Nigerian big man abhors competition and treats disloyalty like leprosy. Aspiring to look like him is not just competition, it is treachery that attracts severe punishment. There must always be a clear difference betweenthe oga and the boy-boywhen both of you are in public. This rule applies across board – do not aspire to attain the boss’ level or position or you will be cut off and tossed away, like weed. The big man must remain the big man and theboy-boymust remain theboy-boyfor the world to be at peace.
Your boss is all-knowing and infallible. From his lips spews uncommon wisdom and never-heard-of ideas. Everything he says is correct. It doesn’t matter how ridiculous and embarrassing it sounds. His fart must smell like perfume to your nostrils. When he asks your opinion on any matter (which is a rare privilege, by the way), you must not only agree with his thoughts but also find adjectives to express your awe at such wonderful ideas and how blessed you are to be schooled at his feet. You must know that he is not asking for your opinion, it’s just his way of seeking validation. The day you disagree with him is the day things begin to fall apart for you. Your Nigerian big man boss hates to be challenged and even more so in public. Only traitors disagree with the boss. So shove your plenty degrees and superior ideas up your rectum and conform to the sycophancy parade. After all, if you were any smarter, you would have been the big man and he, theboy-boy.
His entry into a room must evoke reaction. You must scamper to your feet like pupils at the sight of their headmaster and stand motionless like a statue as he strolls by. You had better be loud with your“Good morning, Chief or Ranka Dede Alhaji”. If his hands bear anything, you must hurry and relieve him of such trouble. Your Nigerian big man boss’ hands are too fragile to carry a briefcase or even a newspaper. He needs both hands-free to constantly adjust the loose ends of hisagbadaorbabarigaand if he is a politician, to acknowledge cheers from hangers-on and supporters who idle around to catch a glimpse of him. You must pull open the car door for him because he doesn’t know how to and as he sits, you must imagine yourself a military cadet and give a full salute. The closer to a zombie your actions are around the big man, the closer you are to his dinner table, and by extension, the more scraps your hungry mouth gets to catch.
Should his shoes get dusty during a function, you need not be told before you whip out your handkerchief and wipe them clean. You can use your bare hands for the purpose. It shows how humble you are. When he is ascending a staircase, be sure you hold up the ends of his flowing apparel, so it does not touch the floor. By all means, when he coughs, make sure you catch cold. On a sunny or rainy day, you must hold an umbrella over his head while taking a beating from the harsh weather, unprotected. His life matters more than yours. You are, because he is.
You must realise that as the aide tooga,oga-madam, by extension, owns your loyalty and allegiance. In fact, she has the power to warm you closer to oga’s heart or have you kicked out like trash in a second. So be wise. Your big man boss does not joke with his wife. Forget the many mistresses and slay queens you know about. He will do whatever to please this main madam. So do everything in your power to be in her good books. Always seek her out just to greet her and while you are at it, make sure you prostrate or genuflect or both. Compliment her dressing and beauty just enough as not to be seen as openly flirting. Remember, everything she wears fits amazingly. Run errands for her as many times as she asks like a good boy or girl, never grumbling. Drive her. Stay up many nights researching and writing her Master’s Degree thesis. This will buy you a good spot in her heart. But don’t take her smiles of gratitude too seriously. She sees you no more than a hungry fellow hanging around her husband for survival and secretly blames you even for his infidelity.
And the kids? they own you too. You must be of good cheer around them. Always smile no matter how your day is going. Forget you have kids their age; greet them. Should you have the bad fortune of them being of the very uncouth type, grow a thick skin to insults and prepare for events that will make you curse your birth. Woe betides you that your big man’s daughter complains that you were late at picking her up from school which made her hungry and gave her a headache. It wouldn’t matter that it was just a five-minute delay caused by a broken-down trailer close to the school gate. When your Nigerian big man boss tongue lashes you for being so irresponsible in front of the child, swallow hard and remember the bigger picture. Insults never killed no one.
When you achieve anything while working for the Nigerian big man — buy a new car, buy land, build a house, start a business, etc, — ensure to keep it discreet. Remember the first advice I gave you here. Your Nigerian big man’s default impression is that you have been stealing from him or that you are now growing wings and would soon seek to fly away. They don’t want you to become independent of them. Your breaking free upsets the balance of roles. So, they would quickly abort whatever progress you think you are making and leave you in a state of arrested development – at their mercy. So be smart. Gather your loot quietly and then abscond when the target has been met. Take note, however, you will never successfully run away from your Nigerian big man boss, whatever you ever own or become will always be one way or the other, attributed to him. And he will always take the glory referring to you gleefully as “My boy.”

How to be a peace-restoring President,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-peace-restoring-president/,2022-02-19T11:35:48+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
There are some places that need peace. One of those places is Nigeria. You can one day assume the office of a President and restore the long lacking peace. I’ve got some tips for you. Please follow me keenly as I unravel to you few tips.
1.Assuming it is 2015 and you want to be a President, do you think it can just happen without promises? The issue I have with plenty people is that they refuse to read their bibles.You would have read where Absalom tried to overthrow the Father, Jonathan.Abi, Goodluck? No, David!  All he had to do was act nice and promise them change. This one no dey fail. If this trick doesn’t work then I can return all your money spent for ticket and campaign.
2.Cases of insecurity may however tend to get worse as years go by, but what can you do? I meant, what can you not do? Just ignore all those rumours of bandits and hoodlums and unknown gunmen. Ignore them.
3.By 2019, if you contest for a second term you will win. I assure you with all my might, strength and heart. You will win.Insha Allah. All you have to do is talk about getting to the next level. Smiles. Who doesn’t want to move to the next level? All these things is just a matter of semantics. If a Professor is your Vice then you have nothing to worry about.
4.Are those rumoured boys still rampaging Sokoto, Kaduna, and a few other places? Just remain silent.
5.Please be silent over any insecurity talk. Keep focusing on how to grow the economy. You have done enough for peace to reign.
6.Act fed up. Break the silence  and warn those boys.
7.If your tenure is about ending 2023 and you’re in 2021 or 2022, just keep warning bandits. Is enough for peace to prevail. Is enough for insecurity to be curbed. By 2022 please promise Nigerians peace before 2023. Tell them the topic of insecurity will be gone by 2023.
8.To further promote peace, act as if you are not interested on who becomes the next President. You can even make a public speech on that. Say your mind. Your mind is that you are not interested on who leads next. Even if you have interest, of whose concern is it? How about some political leaders who anoint successors before leaving? Na your own go loud.
9.By these things you are a Peace restoring President. Congratulations! Your legacy shall never be erased in a hurry."
How not to be an Aregbesola,https://punocracy.com/how-not-to-be-an-aregbesola/,2022-02-18T15:52:59+01:00,"By: Abdulwahab Tajudeen
It is by the grace of God that you have come this far. After many years as a loyal boy and many years in public service as a servant and a product of loyalty-market, I don’t need to tell you the importance of Thanksgiving. If you are a Muslim, build a small mosque inside your mansion, it does matter if you have built it off inflated contracts funds, diverted public funds or received kickbacks, employ one young Imam – elderly ones can be brutal with words – to lead your family in prayers; it matters less if you are always busy with political meetings, paying the loyalty price around the country. What matters is you giving thanks to Almighty God through the salary you’re paying the young Imam.
Or are you a born-again Christian? I thank God for your life. It’s not easy to lose track and find the right path again in this 21st century.  Glory be to God, the highest! I want to guess you know the right way to Thanksgiving, yeah? Donations and tithes. You can hear me right; your best way to show your appreciation to the Almighty that has brought you this far in the murky waters of  the loyal-market is through donations and payment of enormous and intimidating tithes to the Church’s purse in appreciation of God’s wonders in your life. Remember,many showers of rain have fallen that the ground has swallowed.
Please know that thanksgivings alone cannot keep you at the top of the ladder; you still need to overtly and covertly try not to be a dissenting voice. It’s important you avoid showing any displeasure in the presence of your leader for two main reasons. First, you don’t talk while eating. Remember how much your teachers in the primary school invested so much time in you ensuring you learn this fundamental lesson. Second, you will not want to be an Ogbeni Aregbesola.
It is only an Aregbesola that goes to the dinner table after many thanksgivings in his populist regalia and carnival-like manner with his personal DJ and shout at his leader with a large piece of chicken’s lap in his mouth. God forbid you to be like him! I pray that God guides and guard you from making such a grave mistake and allow small boys in the loyalty-market bring your eight years as a governor under scrutiny.
Because with you seated, on a mandate you should be standing on, yourOna Baba Ona, Opon Imon, education reform and state of Primary Health Care (PHC) under your government will now be regarded as bad things to happen after a public holiday that falls on Monday graced with fuel scarcity and no electricity. It will be painful.Very painful for one Elumelu that cannot fẹnu mẹ́nu (keep shut)to quiz you on how you have been eating the sumptuous money meals they have been serving you in the last two years.
What is their concern with the N165 billion you have used in printing holidays’ calendars and changing our Nigeria Prison Service (NPS) to Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) without minding how many numbers of jailbreaks the country has experienced in recent time? Where does your offence lie,ehn? Is it not that you try to hold your leader accountable, trying to hold his hands while you have your own pound of flesh?
Like Aregbesola, you might foresee the aftermaths, so you must avoid being an Aregbesola like a plague. Learn from a wise fallen hero and know how not to be an Aregbesola. Hear me well and heed. Don’t just try to be atop of the situation every time; let the will of God (Ileri Oluwa) come to pass, even if it means your leader’s brother is getting on the wrong footing.
I, Abdulwahab Tajudeen, solemnly declare my intention to be a menace to all social vices, treat each with satire and stay committed to milk as a foundational milk lover; I say MILK!"
Tips on staying woke and rocking the ASUU strike,https://punocracy.com/tips-on-staying-woke-and-rocking-the-asuu-strike/,2022-02-18T15:51:28+01:00,"By: Alhassan Ndaman Aishah
ASUU has gone on strike and I know that your monthly allowances might be halted and you’ll automatically become the house boy/girl at home. Imagine a whole social media chic, a Slay Queen or Fine Boy on campus being asked to go and buy N100 Maggi.O wrong naw!
So, instead of sitting at home and letting your folkssee you finish, here are some things you can do to pass time, to be saved from the hollows of billing anyone for urgent 2k. You know I got you.
First, you need to oppress other students before and after resumption to prove that the strike’s got nothing on you. Also, you do not have to bother yourself with reading. The last strike took months. This one would most likely not be different (can the Federal Government actually pay the sum of N880 Billion Naira to ASUU in one month?You too reason am na). School na side hustle my guy. Go and find money!
Sometimes, the ASUU strike gives us more opportunities and options to better ourselves than the government, so use it wisely.
If you are a fine girl and there are many boys in your area, open a POS shop. You’ll surely make sales (and more male acquaintances). Since your single ass did not get a Val gift this year, you will probably get one next year.
As a male, you can decide to learn vehicle mechanic work. This has a very big advantage because you can use customers’ cars to impress your girlfriends. Be ready to face the consequences thoughcos dem go bill your life tire!
There would be no need to do mechanic work if you’re a very fine boy. Just wise up and use your fine boy privilege to exploit those rich women online.Simon Leviev says hi. Meet him for tutorials!
Since tech bros are the new hot cake, find yourself a tech bro that will be spoiling you with surprise packages, gadgets and funds. Get a handsome one please (so you’d be able to freely take“his view, her view”pictures when you go out to places likeThe Burgundy Restaurant in Abujaand we’d be able to exclaim“God when”).
Now that our Tik-Tokers and YouTubers are home, we are looking toward to their usual amazing contents because we are always bored. I mean change of environment shouldn’t be a problem in your videos as long as securing the bag remains the goal.
Also, if you’re the kind that gets “Oxlaid” for a living, keep it up and make sure your videos leak like Oxlade’s. I mean, that’s great PR for you! More customers!
You know opportunity only comes once, right? So, consider this strike as an opportunity to up your game by interning as a kidnapper with Evans’ godchildren. This is a very lucrative business you should venture into, instead of waiting for several years before getting a degree and a job. Don’t worry about getting caught. It is not a crime here.
Finally, if none of these things work for you, you can just go ahead and get married to a well made Alhaji and live a luxurious lifestyle. Who cares if he’s ugly with three wives and twelve children? You should only be concerned about the quid and the numerous vacations you would be going every year.
If this still doesn’t work, then it means that your village people are at work and you need to get your head washed!"
How to succeed as a writer in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-succeed-as-a-writer-in-nigeria/,2022-02-16T08:40:21+01:00,"By: Nzube Nlebedim
In Nigeria, the successful or soon-to-be successful writer must run away fromsee finish. It kills your career faster than cancer eating into an amoeba. Yes, see finish, in the barest minimum. According to the Dictionary of the Nigerian People (2022),see finish is to be “seen finished,” to be seen more than necessary, and therefore to be overseen. In other words, a person suffering from see finish is close to the most predictable thing that ever happened on earth, like the ground getting wet when rain falls. That is what see finish is. Nigerians are wont to seeing people finish. Yes, yes, humans. But Nigerians are worse at it. Oh, they can see a person to the last hair on their body. This happens when you give just any person or set of people your time.
The successful or soon-to-be successful writer must then be very aware to reply messages late. Yes, the successful Nigerian writer must learn to take African time very seriously. Stroll in when least expected. You have not see the handbook of successful Nigerian writers yet? Oh yes, you have. Of course. Now where did it say they should respond messages immediately they get it? Nowhere. Be it mails, SMS, tweets, etc, responding late is the mark of true importance. Respond too early and you lose your importance. Trust me. See finish, phase one initiated. You do not want that.
When you get to respond to these messages — if you have to respond — which should be about two days after you receive it, ensure you do not sound excited. Excitement? Do you want to lose your place in the oracle of success? I doubt. Read, read, read and edit away every iota of excitement from those messages excited you just typed. Do you want to beseen finish? I hope not.
This is ultra important for the successful Nigerian artiste. Understand that no one takes you seriously if you choose to facilitate every writing workshop or groom every mentee. You do not attend to every event, however available you would be. People must see you as who you are, an oracle, a masquerade that only comes out once a year. None other time. You learn the skill of disappearing, selectively.  And so you must learn to say“Unfortunately, I will be declining this offer.”Do not forget to add “…at this time.” It simply means that you, successful Nigerian writer, although largely incapable of designing to attend such and such events, will be open to attending others if the stakes are raised a little much higher. You must learn pride. What is the successful Nigerian writer without some pride?
What is a successful Nigerian writer without dreads,dada? What do you think you are if you have not begun to leave your hair to grow fully, lice-occupying, damp, smelly, etc? You do not know what you want if you still go around without dreads! Rock yourdada. That is what qualifies you into the cult of the successful Nigerian writer. Like, how dare you come to a literary event bald? Are the demons of misfortune controlling you?
Dear successful Nigerian writer, have you heard of the Power of the Stutter? You must take a cue from Olusegun Obasanjo, or Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, or the many other skilled stutterers we have. Research has shown that stuttering gives a person an air of uniqueness. And no, I am not referring to senseless, uncoordinated stuttering. Not those ones. Not kalolo. I refer to the organised one, the intellectual one, the scholarly stuttering. No one would take you seriously if you have not ahhed and uhmed about fifteen (take heed to the number) times. Do not go beyond 15 or else you would be viewed as a simpleton. Be careful, also, to not go above twenty or else you might just be seen as having a speech defect. Number is key. We understand you have forgotten nothing. Just uhm and ahh enough times to be seen as important.
Lastly, dear successful or soon-to-become successful Nigerian writer, be patriotic. Show, even if you cannot speak your own mother’s language, that you uphold the tenets of African culture. Be a torch bearer of African Pride (you are African, and you are Proud, aren’t you?) and sprinkle every discussion, every Instagram post, every Tweet and everything else, with words that show you support your black brothers. You must make it a point of duty to condemn black on black racism in America even though you care no hoot what extent of tribalism is going on in your own state. It does not matter. What matters is not what is unseen but what is seen. Preach anti-racism everywhere you go, adopt only your African names and do not forget to add diacritics to each letter, even consonants. Yes, it shows the extent of your loyalty to the Tribe.
Also, do not forget to end every email with “daalu” or “ese.” It is too vile to end your emails with “yours faithfully.” It sounds too English, and people will see you as that. Remember, it is a problem of what people see! So, end your emails with words in your local language, even if you spent the better part of a day Googling what they actually meant.
I have learned, by experience, being a successful writer in Nigeria myself, that posing as a powerful witch or ogbanje does the trick. It creates a wall around you that no one will be able to break. Just do not be caught with visible breasts, or attending a church service. Don’t.
I would not leave without dropping this final advice to you, my dear successful and soon-to-become successful Nigerian writer. This one is simple, and I believe quite straightforward – Remember that writers are sad people. They are perennially unhappy, not with their low income, bad book sales and endless grief-striking. So, do not ever paint a picture of happiness in public. Your face must adopt a certain disposition, never smiling and not exactly crying, somewhere just in between. Look the part. Nigeria is hard. Look the part! You are representing the tribe, and people will surely rever you when they have not seen you smile. Or tell me, have you seen Chinua Achebe or Wole Soyinka smiling? I doubt you have. If you have, you are definitely mistaken!
Flood your social media timelines with photos of burning candles and sad puppies or a bloodied Nigerian flag. The flag, in participating, has proven to be quite effective, I must say."
How to be a third-force presidential candidate  ﻿,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-third-force-presidential-candidate-%ef%bb%bf/,2022-02-16T08:37:45+01:00,"By: Ganiu Oloruntade
With about 14 months left for President Muhammadu and his plagued administration topack and goout of Aso Rock, Nigerians are more than eager for real change. After 8 years of strife and turmoil under APC, what more can we ask for? Let’s even face it, the average voter doesn’t want to oscillate between a torn umbrella and a tattered broom at the next general polls, and as such, in dire need of a truemessiah. That’s where you come in as athird forcepresidential candidate who will force the nation out of theAPC-vs-PDPtrap.
Follow me as I walk you through the dos and don’ts of your rodeo.
1. Declare for president
Your first assignment as athird forcecandidate is to announce your intention to run for the nation’s top seat, especially when the election is just a few months away. Listen carefully, it doesn’t matter whether the political party you would later adopt is barely known or lacks the political structures and grassroots penetration needed to win, just declare. Gather a few friends, associates, and well-wishers to make this happen. Don’t forget to flood social media with your flowery declaration speech and fancy pictures of you dressed as Nigeria’sBarrack ObamaorHilary Clinton.
2. Base your ambition on your ‘young’ age
At a time when thesọ̀rọ̀ s’okegeneration is earnestly seeking to lead Nigeria, your entrance into the presidential race is sought-after and will no doubt shake up the political space. Unlike the frail-looking and sickness-prone older presidential hopefuls, you are young, well-educated, and speaks fluently. These, not your solutions to national problems or manifesto, are your selling points. Every speaking engagement or media appearance you get should be an opportunity to remind Nigerians that you deserve to be president because you’re in your 30s or 40s and basking in youthful energy.
3. Don’t listen to anyone
The greatest disservice you can do to your now-declared presidential ambition is to hearken to the voices of so-called social commentators and thought leaders. Some of them, in their bid to discourage you, will write think pieces advising you to run for governor or a National Assembly seat instead. They might even tag you atime waster.Ignore their calls,potatoes will potate. Changing Nigeria requires a top-to-bottom approach, you should reply them.
4. Shy away from the political realities
Politics in Nigeria is dirty, and you shouldn’t get your white kaftan — or blazers, as the case may be — dragged into the mud. So when these folks I’ve earlier warned you about bring to your notice the intense politicking, strategies and funding that come with running for Nigeria’s president, look away. If Emmanuel Macron could pull it off in France, what is stopping you? Even when they tell you that Macron was no stranger in the corridors of power and did the groundwork, don’t answer them.
5. Gaslight Nigerians into supporting you
Nigerians are a difficult bunch to help. Theircoconut heads won’t allow them see you — the beaming light in the dark, dank alley of their many problems. You literally have to force them to reckon with you and your mission to rescue Nigeria. Write lengthy Twitterthreadsandop-edswhere youdragthese ungrateful elements for refusing to support you in your presidential bid, though you stand no chance at winning in the first place.
More importantly, should you eventually lose at the polls and place 12th in the INEC results like somehatersmust have predicted, still blame Nigerians for letting you down. Undeterred, you must prepare for another election cycle to try again. I am rooting for you!

Why we should make Prof. Osinbajo president,https://punocracy.com/why-we-should-make-prof-osibanjo-president/,2022-02-12T10:26:58+01:00,"By: Chuks. Chinyere(jj)
If only one thing is more important than voting Prof. Osibanjo President, it’s getting my PVC – Permanent Voters Card. The Electoral Act is incomplete until there is a provision that accords one more multiple votes according to how stressful the process of getting the said PVC was. Honestly, I do not see why I will go through all thatwahala, sit through the sun and stand in the rain, just for the franchise, to cast one vote, a vote I can’t sell for up to N10,000, especially asthis one wey things dey cost. With four votes, I could just sell one each to Kingsley Moughalu, Khadijah Lamidi-Okunnu and any other third force dreamer with no fixed Party secretariat, for like 15k, use the remaining one to vote Prof. Osibanjo for President. With that 45k, I’ll just place a 2 odd bet and multiply the money, before you know it, I will blow.Kai, my inner Sabinus is on steroids, wisdom will kill me finally.
If we look at this situation well, the lack of a multiple-vote provision might be the reason why President Buhari, in his infinite wisdom, is refusing to sign the Electoral Act into law. But he will, of course, not suggest to the lawmakers to make this crucial adjustment, because if their senses is not working it will work by force. After consistent rejections,no be person go tell them, they would do the needful. I too like that manabeg, a perfect blend of too much wisdom and the fatherly disciple, the mix-fit for Nigerians.
If the lawmakers have strong head, they should override the Presidency and pass that bill into law themselves by two third votes of the National Assembly, they will see who, between all 469 of them and Gen. Buhari who owns this country, by the time they are locked out of the National Assembly. Good governance is for the weak, Father Buhari knows we need all good things and he’s providing them in ways we cannot see most, we just have to be strong and manifest Buhari’s good leadership by faith. So my dear founding and non-founding Umu-Africa, as there is more to your PVC, than promoting Vice President Osibanjo to President, so are they multiple reasons why Prof. Osibanjo would make a terrific President for Nigeria, outside the belabored need for good roads, better social amenities, and accountable governance.
We must focus on better things like,Short Lives Matter. Democracy is supposed to be about representative governance, and since 1999, we’ve had Presidents of various heights, but not one short person can boast of having a short stint as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Commander of the Armed Forces. It is true that the South East is clamoring for an Igbo President in 2023, it doesn’t matter if power is not given but taken. Don’t get me started on how divine it’d be for a short man, who nature had cheated out of a place in the Nigerian Military, to become the Commander of the Armed Forces. Not only will this be cool, it’d be the right thing to do as we would be fulfilling the words of Jesus Christ when the rejected stone becomes the Commander in Chief. 2021 was the year small nyash got her so-long denied recognition, so 2023 should be for short people. Who is better in realizing this dream than Prof. Osibanjo?
It might be true that short people might have gotten a short fuse, and this was evident in 2017 when Prof. Osibanjo was named Acting President. You can’t tell me you did not feel the sweep of peace and serenity across the Nation in that short period, and this was a result of all the short tempers across the Nation, appeased that one of their own who understood the matters on ground was finally on top of the situation after a long journey to the top job. It is also a plus for Nigerians as Prof. Osinbajo’s concise nature, quick decision making process and short temper for irregularities and corruption might be the very ingredient we need to build a nation that would stand tall in the congregation of her peers.
Have you seen a Tiktok President before?
I know that anyone serious about their Presidential life-long ambition, should at this time of the year be doing their consultations in London where we have the bulk of electorates and polling units, and not gallivanting the nooks and cranny of the country, attending elite social functions and accepting the free organic love from the masses, like Prof. Osinbajo has been doing in the last few weeks, videos of which has been circulated on Tiktok, garnished with the scintillating sounds of Amanpiano beats. However, on the bright side, Prof. Osinbajo is a technocrat capable of doing Tiktok challenges. Even if Prof. Osibanjo is making the mistake of not doing his consultations in London like his healthy like a stallion mentor, his vivid use of Tiktok should be a good reason why we must make him President. Have you seen those videos, the way he steps onto the scene with “chilling with the big boys” tune in the background? It induces chills, exemplifying the aura of the coolest Presidential material ever.
Most importantly, Christians should come together for this – are they not tired of paying tithes in Church and paying tax to the Government? With Pastor Osibanjo as President, there will be no need to pay both tithe and tax every month, as one will cover for all. This is what you get for voting a Man of God as President. A picture of Prof. Osibanjo on his knees, talking to his Maker, reminded me of the fictional Prince of Wessex who rushed to kneel and to say a prayer, in the heat of a Viking ambush on his camp. In the middle of his prayers, he got a quick answer, a swift linkup with his Maker, provided with a sharp dagger of the Lothbrok-boys. Prof. Osibanjo doesn’t come off to me like the kind of man who is more religious than reasonable, but if he turns out to be the type that prays and leaves everything to God to handle without the mix of faith and work, I think he’s even more perfect for the job because we need a man who knows beyond healthy faith and reason that what God can not do does not exist.
Imagine the Church and the Government in Nigeria, becoming one. That is Christ’s millennial reign on Earth commencing a bit earlier than planned. Who doesn’t want a Nigeria built on the whims of utopia? Well, this is what we get if we make Osibanjo President."
For the love of country,https://punocracy.com/for-love-of-country/,2022-01-26T08:42:39+01:00,"By: Moses Ameh
“Blessed are those who do not think for themselves, for they shall be called patriots.”
In his 1983 essayThe Trouble With Nigeria, the traitor Chinua Achebe mischievously identified Nigeria’s problem to be, as he put it, “simply and squarely a failure of leadership.” Nothing, I assure you, could be farther from the truth.
In reality, Nigeria’s troubles stem from contaminants like Achebe who have tried, however unsuccessfully, to infect the populace with the virus of common sense. These saboteurs, anarchists and fifth columnists have, like the crafty serpent of old, disguised themselves as activists, critics, and public intellectuals to deceive unsuspecting and faithless idiots into thinking for themselves and, as a consequence, deny them theirEdenicexistence in the paradise called Nigeria.
True patriots must therefore be wary of these false prophets who contrive falsehoods with the help of neocolonialists and other enemies of our collective progress.
Loyal citizens must particularly be careful when on the internet, which is the new theatre of operation in the wicked campaign against our hard-won unity and sovereignty. Social media, especially the microblogging medium Twitter and other inimical platforms which will be exposed whenever they so much as remove a comma from the Generalissimo’s post, must be avoided at all cost.
Idiots who defy this holy injunction will be made to face the full wrath of the law which is assuredly worse than Hell, as it is a respecter of persons. Full compliance will be rewarded by the grace of the Generalissimo and at the Generalissimo’s own convenience, with a recession sachet, subsidy extraction program, and a full list of terrorism sponsors to be read at a press conference by the Honorable Minister for Lies, Propaganda, and Controversy.
To prevent the misfortune of being named on this Judas list, true patriots must refrain from complaining about or criticizing the government which has been instituted by God the Father (who manifests Himself via Godfathers) and not by the ballot.
As you all know, it was complaints and needless criticisms that nearly cost the Israelites the Promised Land. As such, only faith in and prayer for the government will be permitted. All who have ears, let them heed these warnings, lest they be whisked away by men of the sinister service. True patriots who have completely rejected the heretical doctrine of common sense have nothing to fear if they only obey the commandments listed below.
The country is enjoying steady and rapid progress as successive governments are always better than previous ones. Therefore true patriots are to resist the temptation of discontentment, reminding themselves without ceasing that today is better than yesterday; the future can go to hell.
They must also vociferously refute all claims by imperialists that our country is the poverty capital of the world, as these are lies spun to draw the national spirit into depression thereby reversing our progress. Contrary to these silly lies, true patriots must remember that we are the ones who supply the world, out of our abundance, with professionals from every field.
Lastly, it is in the interest of patriots to remember that Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.
2. Forgive and Forget.
It is easier to follow than to lead, so loyal sheep must learn to condone the excesses of service. You must forgive yourrepresentathieveswhenever they sleep off during plenary and allow pythons and monkeys and mammoths and mosquitoes and multi-mammate rats to steal our commonwealth.
You must also forget their sins against you during the campaign year and show true forgiveness by selling your franchise. This you must do more than seventy times seven.
3. Respect Your Leaders Unconditionally.
Leaders are public servants and so are to be the recipients of your unconditional respect demonstrated by complete gullibility. You are to jump out of the way when you hear their sirens, honor them with titles whenever they donate your money back to you, and never ask questions.
“But even if I or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than this, let them face the full wrath of Nigerian law which, for all I know, is a respecter of persons.”

Of societal norms that hold a handful of water,https://punocracy.com/of-societal-norms-that-hold-a-handful-of-water/,2022-01-26T08:14:04+01:00,"By: Destiny Okoduwa
Boy,
Listen, would you? Jot these words down and make of it whatever you deem fit, but I will not take the blame if you refuse to see past the wavy lines of my blurry handwriting. I scribble from a place of innate experience, but I seek to make light of it as much as I can. So, cloaked in satiric words, I make it a rundown of things that are expected of you as a boy. Stop! Now move six-words backwards from the full stop, read the sixth word twice. Thanks. Now, shall we?
Never, I repeat, never should you act because actions come naturally to you. Never should you count hanging your hands like you have a bag strapped on it as a reflex. Never should you swing your arms or snap your fingers when you talk (even though it’s ingrained in you and you can’t help it). Let’s not even go near the bizarre act of batting your eyelids. Don’t be dumb. You know the set of people who are supposed to do that, and you’re not one of them. And if you think doing that doesn’t change the fact that you have a phallus dangling underneath you (even though you might be right), then you must be this hesitant cuss word in my mouth.
You see, emotions may not be restricted to a certain gender, because it is pertinent that you feel a certain way to everything that happens to you. But, there are restrictions to the kind of emotions you must project. Always remember: chin up, dry eyes. It’s sacrilegious that they’d ever find the glassy liquid trail down your cheeks. Or would you like to be referred to as a coward? As a sissy? Boy, brace up. Keep the sour emotions in check. Boys are brick walls and so do not feel the hurt of pain, regardless of how numbing or deep-seated it might be. Have you heard me?
Here’s a story for you.
Once, while a boy was buried in his house chores, his mother had a female guest who wouldn’t stop gushing over the boy’s dexterity in handling and moving from one chore to the other. She watched in awe—like it was supposed to be a thing of amusement—as he effortlessly did his thing, spewing compliments here and there. Bouyed by the utter admiration evident in the guest’s actions and words, the boy entered into the kitchen and churned out a mouth-watering meal. Dazed was this guest that, upon leaving, she said to her host, “How were you able to raise him this way? You’re so lucky he’s not like other boys.”
Moral of the story: You’re not supposed to be so good—read as ‘any good at all’—in doing works around the house, works that are meant for that gender in skirt, not even to save your life. It is considered normal if you grumble, stamp your feet, and bounce when you’re compelled to do so. Because, isn’t that how boys roll? That way, you’ll be saved the earache of compliments that do not hold water, like: “Wow! Your mother did a good job bringing you up like a female child.” “Your girlfriend no go dey do yanga for you.” Like that should even be a big deal in the first place. Like there are separate manuals for bringing up a male and female child respectively.
Boy, when it comes to talks about sex education and sexual health, and you hear them say, “Zip up.” Note that it doesn’t mean that you should censor your genitals (it certainly doesn’t apply to your gender), it means you’ve got to censor your maxilla and mandible, your mouth. Come to think of it, place it on a weighing scale, the percentage of female rape cases to that of male rape cases. You’ll agree with me that the statistics are right, very right.
See why?
Forget the fact that nobody buys that joke in this century anymore; would you really speak out should you fall a victim of forced sexual activity, be it a man or a woman? Don’t even lie. I know you wouldn’t. And it’s cool, boy. You, my boy, is an imagery for strength. The perpetrator can never be the perpetratee. And besides, you should allow society the luxury and satisfaction of basking in their ‘deliberate’ ignorance. You really should.

"Nigeria hires architects, photographers in bold move to address food scarcity",https://punocracy.com/nigeria-hires-architects-photographers-in-bold-move-to-address-food-scarcity/,2022-01-21T07:56:59+01:00,"BURJAH (The T.A. Report)― The government of Nigeria has shocked the rest of the world by employing professional architects and photographers in the hopes of finally nailing the problem of food insecurity.
Launched by President Moh’d Bwari on Tuesday, the “FCT mega rice pyramid” project is made up of a total of one million bags and has been described as not only the the first-of-its-kind but the largest known cereal pyramid in the world.
It was learnt that the same architects who worked on the Burj Khalifa building in Dubai were contracted to come up with the best design for the towering piles of rice bags. The photographers also worked with consultants from Hollywood to capture the iconic structure from the best angles.
“With this project, Nigeria takes a million steps in the direction of food security and abundance,” said presidential aide Bashir Modi.
“By the time we release these bags into the market at discounted rates, they will crash the price of rice and make it affordable for everyone. Rice farmers will also be inspired to double their efforts when they receive the stunning, high definition pictures of the pyramids, with the president standing in front of them.”
Nigerians, however, wonder if the project is worth it, considering how much must have been sunk into transporting the bags of rice from different parts of the country, arranging them, and commissioning the pyramids.
Meanwhile, the United Nations agency Food and Agriculture Council (FAC) has described the move as “absolutely astonishing”.
“Honestly, none of our member-states had ever thought along this line before,” observed FAC spokesperson, Pete Ballington.
“We’ve always thought the solutions to food scarcity were simple and straightforward, you know: improve production capacity, mechanisation, modernisation of farming practices, storage capacity, transportation infrastructure, and all that. But maybe pyramids are a shortcut after all. We can’t wait to see how this new technique pans out.”

How to recover from a bad break-up as a straight man,https://punocracy.com/how-to-recover-from-a-bad-break-up-as-a-straight-man/,2022-01-19T07:25:09+01:00,"By: Ayodimeji Ameenat
Break-ups can be harsh, painful and can make life suck a whole lot. Yet, people don’t talk about how hard it is for heterosexual men to deal with heartbreaks. Here is the talk: Heterosexual men, you  don’t have to wallow in misery. Recovery is a shining sun; all you have to do is pull the curtains.
It might be hard because, a point after your heart break, you might be tempted to do crazy things. So stay away from sharp objects because you might be tempted to carve her names in objects and in fruits. But don’t do that, because eating a fruit her name is carved in will remind you of how good it felt to eat her and you don’t want to remember.
Instead, make a beautiful tool of your hands and fingers to milk yourself. This will give you the satisfaction of knowing that just like they made all your efforts go down the drain, some of the resources to make the beautiful babies you once planned are also going the same path.
Every night after you are done milking, read a fiction book that ends in a break-up, they help more than music. After finishing a chapter, replace your pillow with the book because your soft pillow will remind you of her body and what it feels like resting your head on her thighs and chest, but you don’t want to remember. So don’t use pillows.
Only take cold water baths, because warm water will remind you of the warmth of her body and how imperfect warm water showers are without her in it, you would be reminded of how it was like to have her in your embrace. So stick with cold water, something to match the temperature of your heart and to ensure your body temperature doesn’t get too high.
Get a rebound. The saying goes: When a phone is damaged, sell the spare parts and buy yourself a Lemonade drink. Give yourself to someone who needs a broken person, so you can make sweet Lemonade together.
Finally, if everything doesn’t work, call her back. If you love her so much push for it, fight for it. Rejection is the final recipe for recovery and you, my friend, are Ramsey Noah.

Another presidential aspirant visits Aso Rock,https://punocracy.com/another-presidential-aspirant-visits-aso-rock/,2022-01-19T07:04:18+01:00,"By Ajibade Abdullah Adewale
Amidst the gathering political storm towards the 2023 general elections, a presidential aspirant whose name I shall not reveal for fear of elimination has visited the president of this country to receive his blessing and sail ahead in his ambition.
An insider revealed to this reporter that the president assured the aspirant of his support, and also promised him the support of his cabinet members and the people of Daura.
“The people of Daura got me elected. Once you have their support, you have already won. So, with me behind you, you already have their support,” the president assured.
However, this presidential candidate seemed not to be comfortable, the insider said. The reason was that he couldn’t trust the assurance of the president.
To confirm this development, this reporter placed a call to Mr. President’s preferred aspirant. In the course of our discussion, he raised concerns that the president’s support won’t take him anywhere. Rather, what he needs is the support of the national leader of their party, since he facilitated the emergence of the incumbent president.
On hearing this, this reporter was stunned and pressed further.
Reporter:Have you forgotten that your national leader announced his ambition a few days ago?
Presidential Aspirant:Well, erm… the issue is that I will meet him to step down for me. He is a great mentor and I am sure it’s what he can do.
Reporter:While you visited the president undisclosed, your national leader’s visit is public. We saw the president laughing with him. What is your view of this?
Presidential Aspirant:You seem not to understand how politics works. You know, the president said in a recent interview with this popular television station that he would not declare his favourite candidate to avoid being eliminated.
As you could see, our national leader’s visit was made public, so he’s not the president’s favourite, unlike mine that’s not made public. Mr. Reporter, I am his candidate and I have received his blessing and been assured of his full support. Just that it will be hard without the support of our national leader.
Reporter:How do you plan to woo your National Leader?
Presidential Aspirant:Well, I will visit him along with the immediate former governor of Osun and, probably, the publisher of Ovation Magazine too.
Reporter:But things don’t seem smooth between your national leader and the former governor. Even, the publisher of Ovation has also declared to contest for the president of this country.
Presidential Aspirant:As regards the former Governor, he is only joking. Eventually, he will support my candidacy. And as for that Publisher of Ovation magazine, he only wants to spend the little he has unnecessarily. He will also end up supporting me as I am the president’s preferred.
Reporter:Away from that, what are your plans for the country?
Presidential Aspirant:Well, I will build on the incumbent president’s legacy. He has performed excellently. From a smooth economy to a stable power supply to a decrease in the unemployment rate. Our poverty level has drastically reduced. Also, military intervention will be limited henceforth. As you know, insecurity has become a thing of the past. Well, these are some of my plans that made the president show interest in me. However, he can’t drum his support for me now to avoid being eliminated
The Presidential Aspirant, after this interview, vowed to announce his ambition as soon as he has informed the president and the only thing left is to inform the Nigerian populace. “Don’t worry, consultation has started in that regard,” he said.
Important to add that the National Leader is healthier than the incumbent president and the fact that he has been nurturing this ambition for a while now has made him most-deserving of the presidency. Who says a healthy kingmaker can’t be king?

Have you said a new year testimony in your church yet? If no is the answer, then you aren’t doing well at all. You are making it look as though the God of your church is not good enough to be testified of. I therefore implore you to do so as quick as possible as I’ll be writing for you a close  to perfect guideline. You should testify.
Below are few guidelines. Please do well to pay attention to the listed directives. I have attended local and international churches, so I know what I am saying.
1.Ensure you do not attend all those big churches where they’ll ask for your storyline before you are given the chance to say what God has done for you. No one should scrutinize your testimony before you say it. It must come fresh, new and original to the hearing of everyone. You are the only one who had the experience and no one has ever had same.
2.Another strict warning. On the day you want to return all the glory to your God, do not attend those churches where a protocol or usher is assigned to hold the mic while you talk. These kinds of churches will want you to summarize a story that would make an award-winning Novel into three to four lines because of time. Who does that?! Your story, I mean your testimony, requires time. You need time to say the testimony smoothly. Attend where you will be handed the mic.
3.Once you’re handed the mic, your brain should automatically forget the five minutes you nodded to while getting the mic from the coordinator. If the coordinator was you, would he say an ideally hours-long testimony in five minutes? To narrate the wonders of God is not a five minutes something. They know it but they just want to tempt you. You are given the floor so make good use of it. You can even use the whole day to testify. This year is your year. Take charge. Take control. Conquer.
4.Shout ‘Praise the Lord’ as if everyone is deaf. Of course they may as well be deaf to have not heightened their voices like yours. Scream the ‘Praise the Lord’ again. Repeat it as many times as possible. You can do something like, “Praise, Praise, Praise, Praise, Praaaise the Lord!” You can only choose to stop when their ‘Halleluyah’ corresponds with your energy. The Nigerian God is not deaf; you just need to alert everyone that you are about testifying.
5.You can now start thinking of a song that will match your intending narration. If the testimony is about God’s protection, there are songs for that. If the testimony is of God’s provisions, there are songs for it. If your wound got healed, we have myriads of songs for it. And so on.
By this time, the five minutes is exhausted but, nonetheless, sing your song. Every true testimony must be preceded by a song. If you choose to sing a worship song then you must ensure you see people raise their faces and hands as they join you before you can even think of stopping. If it is a praise song, then they have to dance before you signal the instrumentalists to stop.
6.As you begin the main thing, ensure you smile sheepishly and start by saying how grateful you are to the God of your church. E.g, “I thank the God of this Land for what he has done”. In Ibibio you can say, ‘abasi oto isong ami okpon eti eti’ (the God of this Land is very great).
Be well detailed in your narrative. Do not omit any action. I suggest:
“Church halleluyah! It was one evening like that… when I slept that night, I woke up the following morning. As I woke up, I said my morning prayers… praaaaise the Lord! Church, halleluyah! So as I was saying, I started thinking of what to eat in the morning. In that morning there was nothing to eat. I sent my child on an errand to the market…”
Please neither be concise nor precise while narrating a testimony in your church. People who are precise are trying to save time and they will go to hell.

"‘Nigerian senator’ world’s best job, says study … ‘you don’t even have to do jack’",https://punocracy.com/nigerian-senator-worlds-best-job-says-study-you-dont-even-have-to-do-jack/,2022-01-10T06:51:01+01:00,"UAR(The T.A. Report)—The world’s most gratifying job is being a senator, particularly in Nigeria, a new study has revealed.
In a report published on Monday by the Centre for Research on Universal Income, Statistics, and Employment (CRUISE), it concluded after months of analysis that no other job comes close.
“Coming at a distant second is the work of being in a long-distance sugar-baby relationship with a rich, extravagant person,” noted lead researcher Ayuba Danladi.
Danladi explained that the variables examined by the centre are simple. They merely compared the benefits obtained from the job to the efforts required to maintain it.
“Everyone knows federal lawmakers in Nigeria, especially senators, are some of the highest paid in the world. But unlike their counterparts in advanced countries, they are not really expected to do jack.”
They could sit for onlytwo out of 12 monthsand there would be no public outrage. In those two months too, their plenaries do not last more than a few hours and some of them, in fact, sleep through the debates.
“If you want to be seen as active or seen to earn your humongous salaries and allowances, sponsor a few bills, commission a few constituency projects (with tax payers’ money disguised as charity, of course), and make social media-worthy speeches about how the country is in deep trouble and how the leaders must do the right things. You could even shed a tear or too so that your sincerity is not in doubt,” Danladi said.
“But the truth is you don’t even have to do these things to be re-elected in perpetuity. Nigerian senators are the highest-paid figureheads in the world and their employers, the citizens, have no problem with it as long as they occasionally benefit from so-called empowerment projects.”
What’s more, he continued, all you need to be elected into office is some tangible business or political capital, a secondary school leaving certificate (genuine or not), and to have been born at least 35 years prior to the time of election (a fact which anyone hardly bothers to confirm).
“According to Nigerian law, anyone who is noted to be a lunatic or to possess an unsound mind is not qualified. But it is almost as if such people are even preferred nowadays.”
Meanwhile, reacting to the CRUISE study, Senate President Mad Lauhan said it isn’t true the honorable lawmakers are overpaid considering the trend of inflation in the country and growing insecurity, which should make them entitled to pay increases and hazard allowances.
“Ordinarily, we should have placed an order for bulletproof private jets considering how our honorable colleagues are now embarrassed at airports  by flight delays and whatnot. But we understand too well the state of the economy and don’t want to overburden the country’s purse,” Lauhan said.
“For an organ of the government that has two employers, the people and the presidency, we should even be paid twice, but we are not asking for all these things even though they are fundamental.”
He added that it is also ridiculous to suggest that the senators are doing little to nothing to deserve their emoluments.
“Do you know how stressful it is to pad a budget by nearly a trillion naira?”"
‘Who am I kidding?’ … Local man postpones new year resolutions to 2023,https://punocracy.com/who-am-i-kidding-local-man-postpones-new-year-resolutions-to-2023/,2022-01-03T09:32:46+01:00,"Earth C-137(The T.A. Report)— Reports reaching us confirm that, after several relapses, Local Man* has given up trying to start the new year on a clean slate of good behaviour and discipline.
“Perhaps 2022 is not my year after all,” he admitted to our correspondent, as he sipped a bottle of alcohol wearing a wry smile. “Initially, I thought maybe I’d start over in February. But it doesn’t have the same kick to it, you know.”
A recent study conducted by the Pocotua Institute of Human Psychology (PIHP) found that about 92 per cent of new year resolutions made on the eve of 2022 had a lifespan of less than 24 hours.
The surprising result was disclosed on Monday by the institute’s Research Lead, Paul Tableau, during a press conference in New Zuland.
“We expected some sort of epic fail, but we didn’t think it would be this depressing,” said Dr Tableau. “Usually, for a couple of days, or even weeks, we witness a sharp drop in certain vices such as substance abuse, porn and internet addiction, and even one-(wo)man sexual activities, before they pick up again. But this time around, it’s like people did not even try.”
This study has been received happily by kleptocracies such as Nigeria where regime spokespersons reportedly described new year resolutions as attempts to overthrow the government.
“We do not welcome anything that threatens the perfect status quo,” one aide said. “Nature abhors a vacuum. From giving up old habits and becoming better, well-informed people, who knows what’s going to happen next.”
PIHP disclosed that some of the worst offenders were politicians, who had no intentions even from the beginning to keep their promises. For instance, one head of state in Africa, Modu Bwari, had said in his New Year address that he remained resolute in his “determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous nation of our dream”.
“But when we reached out to him a day after the speech to ask how his resolution was faring, he merely laughed his ass off on the phone,” one PIHP source revealed.
“What is this? I can’t even remember what I said. I just read what Pemi gave to me.If you have any questions, please direct them to him,” President Bwari had allegedly replied.
Meanwhile, Local Man has not completely given up on himself, as he’s hanged his redemption on yet another circumambulation of Earth round the Sun.
“We go again next year,” he said re-assuringly. “At least that gives me something to look forward to in the long term.”

On the subject of x and y (chromosomes),https://punocracy.com/on-the-subject-of-x-and-y-chromosomes/,2021-12-31T11:43:26+01:00,"By: Ogboriefon
There are several ways
that a man can prove himself useless. He can love Nicki Minaj, think pink is
cute, enjoy k-drama, love cooking or (this disgusts me to even mention) be
capable of tears. God forbid that you ever get entangled with a man who is capable
of tears. The men in the above list are useless but the most useless of them
all should be a man with female children. Weak men with weak spermicide who
marry women with weak eggs to birth a weak shame. Tueh! I spit on them.
Your wife already committed the crime of being a woman. Instead of her to just crawl into a corner after marriage and wash off the shame of that heinous crime, the crazy woman is actually just birthing criminal reinforcement in your house! Can you believe the audacity?! Instead of the mother witch to repent her ways, she is just spitting out more witches — evil bird birthing evil birds (I kid you not, that is a real Yoruba proverb).
It is not really her fault though (can you detect the sarcasm? hehehe). It is the enemies. They’ve ganged up on you. They want to shame your ancestors. Have you seen how Iya Biliki Alata looks at you when you walk past her stall everyday on your way to your mechanic workshop? Those looks are enough to kill the men in your balls. You can poke her eyes out later but now you need a dire solution to the witchcraft of your wife that has collaborated with Iya Biliki Alata to rob your family legacy of bouncing black skin boys. Not while you’re living!
There are ways to tackle this. First, drag your wife to any medical office that has gynecology written on it. Don’t be like some ignorant idiots who drag the wives to physicians only to be redirected to the gynecologist. It won’t speak well for the intelligence in your family legacy. Gynecology is just a fancy name for people who have nothing better to do than sit on the other side of a desk and pore into people’s nakedness. Which means they may not be very smart. So once they roll their eyes as if they get many men with exceptional ideas like yours, and start pouring out things like X and Y chromo-whatever, just grab your missus and run. Technology joined the league of your enemies. You poor man.
How many Yoruba movies have you seen? With ideologies like yours I’m willing to bet the answer is “many”. Good. Then you must know of that common scene that is a nightmare for medical practitioners — the scene where the doctor tells you to “stick the house’s leg in it”. Your own doctor didn’t prescribe that but they can go to hell. You should know the next place to go since modern medicine has failed you.
The gods are more experienced in matters like that. Do not go to an Osun shrine though. It will be ironic going to a goddess to request a stop to your wife’s habit of spurning gargoyles. She can strike you down if you met her in a bad mood. So go to the gods with toxic masculinity. I know you dislike them because they are nothing like you but just go. It’s all for a greater purpose. If your Muslim wife refuses to eat any of the lizard liver concoction sent to her, remind her of your motto:
“You either give me a male child or pakout!”
If the lizard livers and snake intestine still do not work, the gods must have received a bribe behind you. With ordinary cornmeal and palm oil, those ones will change their patrons. But you know who does not receive a bribe? The white man’s god. Jesus, Yesu, Jesu… Anyone you want. Cast all your fears unto him.
Be careful with the places you go to meet the white man’s god though. Don’t go near any of those churches with the fancy names. Those ones will tell you to stand before the whole congregation before giving you the miracle that you desperately need. Your golden family legacy forbids that you stand before people to tell them you’re too weak to produce a single heir. You have to either go to the real local churches with their multitude of candles or the ones without the footwear. Strange right? But all religions are. Miracles live in strange place.
You have to understand that Jesu is a very disciplined god. He has a weird anger or a well deserved beef against food. So your request for his help will come with a lot of white fasting. But that is none of your business. Your missus is the one with the problem, so let her face the fasts. Linking her up with the prophet/ess is a privilege that she better be grateful for all her life. You’re nice like that.
Just to achieve a complete result, you can meet Alfa Kadiri or Sheu Asani in the smoke and tumeric-filled one bedroom apartment. Sheu Asani has three wives with ten male children. He is probably the best choice. You check out a philanthropist’s clothes before accepting clothes from him. How do you accept Dior from a man wearing a Prada rip-off? Think about it.
Do you feel weak after all these run-arounds? You want to give up? Really?! Do you want your home to be filled with dirty conniving witches who will one day gather firewood to boil your destiny and that of your forefathers in giant cauldrons in the middle of the night? No, right? Then get up my man. The battle has just begun!"
Go big or go home: A tribute to the Nigerian sense of justice,https://punocracy.com/go-big-or-go-home-a-tribute-to-the-nigerian-sense-of-justice/,2021-12-06T08:13:20+01:00,"By: Ogboriefon
I have never been as proud of my country as I am these days. This country just makes my heart puff with pride every bloody time. You know, when religious people say, “actions are judged according to intentions,” I did not know it affected the judicial system too. I have been to a Nigerian court once after all, and I can swear to you that the judge in that high court did not care about the stabbed deceased being your wife’s lover who got his karma after making you raise his five children. No, the judge won’t even budge before slamming you in that hole for life. Even though, you know behind those tough glasses and sour expression, he would have done the same thing. Hypocrites, all of them.
But intentions count too, my brother. Some idiots do not know that because they are stuck in the lower class all their life. Even their crimes are lower class. Why else will they steal an iPhone in a computer store when they can pass small money to the right people and afterwards claim the entire store to themselves? Lower class thinking! Lower class thinking will land you inside the box, my friend, unless you think outside the box.
In Nigeria, your crimes may not matter, if you have the right intention(s). Intentions are useless too if they are only inside you, you need to bring them out. How? Must I teach you every damn thing?
Look, it is a matter of, “go big or go home.”
Why snuff only one life? Go big or go home, drop an home-made bomb in a market then watch the state Governor crawl to you in the middle of the night. Yeah, the same one whose security guards would have knocked your head off your neck if you had stayed too long in his red-carpeted path. “Spare us”, he would say, “spare my tenure. The next tenure after this, you can bomb all you like. Do this, and you can have anything you want.” A stabbed man will put you in a cell, picking dropped soap from the slimy floor all your life but a dirty bomb gets you a date with the Governor.
Go big or go home.
On the subject of bombs, if you can get a patron who knows the right people, you can get your hands on several anti-aircraft missiles. Now, you only need to let the right people know you have that weapon. You know how they say that the greatest weapon is the one you do not have to use? Just let them know you have it. Then sit as they pay you. “You can bring anyone down. It’s a free country for you. We can just tell people it went missing or the brake failed or the windshield was creamy or something. But do not bring the Presidential plane down. No, it is not about explaining how it happened. There are always words, and we have skilled orators with us. If you bring him down, the next one will not be this accommodating.”
Go big or go home.
Why will they do all these when they can just wipe you away in the blink of an eye you ask? Afterall you’ve seen what they do to hardened lawbreakers like unarmed protesters and freedom agitators. Well, I do not know but it must have something to do with your intention. You, my dear, are only a bandit, not a terrorist. Yes, you kidnap people against their wish. Yes, you spread fear among several Nigerians going about their peaceful lives. Yes, you have better weapons than the Nigerian military. Yes, you are a rising threat that keeps on rising while everyone else is busy waiting for Spiderman: No Way Home. But the oga on top said you are only a bandit, not a terrorist. You’ve gone big, so why should you go home?
You know those ones in the wrong geopolitical zone? Those ones fighting against their imprisonment and torture? Those ones are the terrorists. They are daft because they are yet to learn their lesson: Go big or go home."
"Gov. Obiano, listen to the voice of unreason",https://punocracy.com/gov-obiano-listen-to-the-voice-of-unreason/,2021-11-24T07:44:39+01:00,"By: Chuks Chinyere.
I am a 27-year-old businessman with a total net worth the average yahoo boy would blow without flinching, yet I believe I can hit the $1trillion mark before Elon Musk. You can call it wishful thinking but I call it Thinking Big — exactly what Governor Obiano should be doing with his political career.
I find it disheartening that some pundits would find ink in their pen to write plenty about how Gov. Obiano has done less than an admirable job in his almost eight years as amiable Governor of Anambra State, especially in comparison with Fmr. Governor Peter Obi.
First of all, comparison is a thief of joy; you don’t compare people like that, you have to accept the people just the way they are and appreciate their effortless efforts. In case no one had noticed, it takes quite a bit to stay fly at 60+, especially while married to a wife who is constantly trying to outdo you with the hair relaxer.
Think about it, Gov. Obiano could have decided to do nothing in his first term as he did in his second term, but he chose to light up Aroma. It doesn’t matter if he didn’t conceive the plan, kick the project off, or see it to near completion. What matters is, Aroma is shining — when it can, like half of the sun on the Biafran flag.
For a multi-party political system, the rare occurrence of another party other than APC or PDP winning gubernatorial elections in Nigeria in the last decade makes no modest remarks about how much Gov. Obiano has done in his second term as governor of Anambra State. You could try to rain on Gov. Obiano’s parade again and imply that the National Working Committee of the party is more worthy of the praise, right to the last man on that grassroots committee, who did the hard job of convincing Ndi Anambra to trust their party’s decision one last time … after what isi-champo used their eyes to see in nearly eight years.
It is true that the Angel you know, is better than the Devil you know too well, the reason why APC or PDP wasn’t so much of an option, yet we still would give credit to Gov. Obiano for not putting a knife to the cock before Christmas, like his Deputy Governor.
2023 is around the corner, this time the most revered position in the land will be open as His Excellency, President Buhari, in his established respect to the Nigerian constitution and evidenced love for Nigerians, has declared his disinterest in a third term. It is true the lot of Nigerians who had summoned the courage to demand the President continue his rulership of peace and progress met themselves with a bit of disappointment and fear for how much they might be needing to pay lawyers, with a new President on the seat.
Gov Obiano on the other hand is in for a landslide to victory. Now is the perfect time for Gov. Obiano to jump ship to the APC, where he has got his best chance to become Nigeria’s next President.
Nigerians deserve to enjoy what Ndi-Anambra has been licking their fingers to, for almost eight years now. It can’t be said enough, how high the time is for an Igbo Presidency and APC is just the right place for Gov. Obiano to help the Igbo people achieve this.
I would advise he shouldn’t be bothered about more lucrative and realistic adventures like running for a seat in the Senate, which the cock he is presently riding can make him come to. Dear Gov. Obiano, listen to the voice of unreason, do not take the path that your friends have taken, reach for the stars, Think Big. The Presidential seat is just your stepping stone, don’t let the tussle between Jagaban and Yemi rattle you."
How to ensure you never live a fake life,https://punocracy.com/how-to-ensure-you-never-live-a-fake-life/,2021-11-24T07:36:15+01:00,"By: Ogboriefon
Today, Salami called you a pretender. Right
to your bloody face. He says you’re living a fake life. Now that you think of
it, you see it too, don’t you?
You don’t smoke. You don’t talk dirty. You no dey follow yansh. You no dey tear ticket – no, reason am. Na life be this? You see it too, you know it. You are a pretender.
As your selfless instructor who values your
inner personality and is deeply invested in seeing you thrive in the ways of
the world, here are a few tips that should help you discover your true self and
quit living that fake life. Amen?!
First, my boy, smoke loud. Yeah, you’ll cough at the first few trials but we’ve all been there, it’ll pass. Remember, you have to show Salami. If that boy smokes three, you should take it to fifteen. That way, you show the nigga who’s the real GOAT. The furnace in you is greater than the one that lives in him.  You don’t like the smell? Shut up! Pretend as if you do. Pretend as if it’s the smoke of smoked fish for instance. Perfect! You’ll get used to it. It’s all part of the process.
Oh, the main goal of this whole thing is not to pretend? Whaaaaaaat? Who would have guessed? But you see, pretending to like loud is different from pretending not to like loud. One pretence is real and the other pretence is just … nerdy. You will not be a nerd by the special grace of God!
Second, follow the girrrllsss! Especially those with big … you get. You get, eh? Omokomo! Hehe.
You don’t like to? Come off it! Stop
pretending! This is a safe space, yunno. You’re a fine boy, you have money, so you’re
a follower of women by default. And that’s that about that.
On a second thought, big alone does not cut
it. Follow tall, follow short, follow dark and follow light. Sha make sure they
all follow the duality of aesthetics. Awon oni word and opposite. Ìbà!
Moving on, partyyyyyy!!!!!!! Now, it really
doesn’t matter that you hate the sound of speakers, or the smell of cheap
perfume and party goer’s sweat. I, and the rest of the world, do not care that
you think the Ameno hour is just a waste of money.
I mean, who doesn’t like to get lost in the bottles once in a while? Who on God’s own earth doesn’t like a little time out at the club now and again — I mean, lálaálẹ Sátidé? Come off it man! I repeat, this is a safe space, you need to keep it real. If that requires a bit of pretending, so be it.
The drinks too, very important. Yeah, it
tastes bitter. What do you think they put in Gulder and Stout bottles?
Strawberry? You think Star was made in Apple flavor? Of course it is bitter!
That’s the stuff men are made of. Bottoms up now, you’ll get used to it.
If Salami conks out after ten bottles, make sure you stand straight after fifteen. Who’s his daddy now?
Also, don’t worry about the vomit on your
clothes later on. Behavioral hazard. Happens from time to time. I mean, that’s
a very little sacrifice for keeping it real, don’t you think?
Now, to the most important rule. As you
paint the town red, everybody must hear! You, my dear, have arrived and their
daddies need to hear it!
I mean, what’s the use of loud that you
smoke in the corner of your room? Always step out in style, with a roll behind
your ears and smoke coming out of your eyes. Don’t also forget to upload the
video from the recent smoke party Abdul forced you to attend. Boya you should
block the parents before that sha, you know how Alhaja can get. In fact, block
all the family members, make no busy body go pour sand for your garri.
Done? Good.
Now update your status and your feed.
Don’t forget the Hashtags.

"Dear Doubting Thomas, it is true; no one was killed at Lekki tollgate",https://punocracy.com/dear-doubting-thomas-it-is-true-no-one-was-killed-at-lekki-tollgate/,2021-11-18T07:57:45+01:00,"By: Niyi Williams
Dear Doubting Thomas,
It’s been one year and one month since your last public rebuttal of the fabricated reportage of the 20th of October 2020 shooting at the Lekki toll-gate. And you were right, my dear countryman. No one was killed on that colourful night.
How are you? I heard that you seriously took to spreading the presidential gospels of the lord, your saviour — in Aso Rock — after that incident. How has the ministry been so far? Have you also been enjoying the dividend of democracy that Prophet Bubu and his co-pastors prophesied because we haveo. And I know you might not know, so I must tell you that the cities and villages in our country are safer, more than ever, for the old and young.
The reason I’m writing to you after our Twitter disagreement on the 22nd of November 2020 is to acknowledge and congratulate you, belatedly, for your keen insight into all that transpired between the Nigerian youth and the armed men of the force.
Who would have thought that a large population of young (wo)men could unanimously echo that their friends, brothers, lovers, acquaintances were gunned down like the reckless sheep that jumped into a gang battle? I mean who were they trying to fool? Can a large group of youth who did not know each other from Adam be more correct in their narration of an eventtheyexperienced — first hand — than our highly respected men of timber, khaki and calibre? No. No. May we never stoop so low.
I want to further appreciate the profoundness of your explanation over the well-circulated eye-witness accounts, pictures, videos, and DJ Switch’s IG stream. Thomas, my guy! You were right all along sha. The eye-witnesses were rubbish, apparently. I mean what sane country takes seriously the statement of youthful survivors who went through the greatest patriotic risk to defend the sanctity of their citizenship? Certainly not our beloved and prospering Nigeria.
Thomas, you wouldn’t believe it, but I recently came to the conclusion that the pictures of the panicky youths, the bullets and the bloodstains on the one hand, and the videos of gunshots, smoke, hysterical prancing and especially DJ Switch’s live stream, on the other hand, were all fake. Just as you smartly pronounced. In fact, to confirm the fakeness of it, I revisited the tons of Twitter bookmarks I had made and applied the new forensic testing tools we developed at the Unifasty of Lagons. Guess what, Thomas, you were right for doubting.
No single soul was killed. Just about 99 confirmed shot-dead bodies, only!
At that point, as the scientist that I am, I subjected the videos, pictures and all to a second round of testing… I think the forensic testing tools we developed at the Unifasty of Lagons may be faulty. Can you imagine?! This machine said you must have now realised the madness of your position after this one year! Sorry. Cancel that. In general, the machine said some rubbish like, “Isn’t it an act of foolishness that you claimed wisdom and judgement over a tragedy of that nature while sitting in the comfort of your room?” It revealed also that your judgement and follow-up anti-EndSARS advocacy only showed the absence of intelligence in your colossal education.
Specifically, nonetheless, the machine revealed that:
But I don’t believe the machine. I’m sure you doubt it too. After all, who knows whether it’s a ploy developed by the opposition party to discredit the current government? I mean it might just be another innovation by IPOB and Oduduwa Nation to have a basis to split the country.
My dear doubting Thomas, now I salute your ingenuity. I hope you never stop being so smart.
By the way, remember the report of the Army Commander who said that “Soldiers were attacked at Lekki Tollgate but still offered water to protesters”? Please tell him I’m yet to receive mineo.
I expect your response.
Your countryman,Niyi Williams."

Behold a new Jerusalem!,https://punocracy.com/behold-a-new-jerusalem/,2021-11-16T06:33:50+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
It pays to have visionary person as a leader. It really does. Of course that is one of the qualities of leadership. One cannot assume an office with blurry sight, else such will mislead the mass. There are states with blind leaders but such is not the case of Akwa Ibom. We have a leader with foresight.
If an ecclesiastical title is not attached to the name of your Governor then you are all far from the way to heaven. You people should check yourselves again. Without titles like Deacon, Apostle, Pastor, Reverend, your leader is an ordinary man. And how can an ordinary man pilot the affair of a whole state with no sense of spirituality?
Our Governor has seen the second coming on the way. He has seen it. He has the eyes to see what we cannot. He sees on behalf of us, that is why he has dedicated N23.7bn for building of a mega worship centre within a duration of just four years (2019-2022). This is the kind of budget a Governor should focus on, not on frivolities like education, medical facilities, and the likes.
To those still bothering about education, what will education do for you when our leader has seen the second coming? ‘That same God’ of Noah and the ark has opened the eyes of our Governor. If you like stay there and be criticizing what you do not know. As for me and my family we shall join in building this worship centre.
My humble plea: Dear Governor, please make the budget for this worship centre N100.2bn at once. This will accommodate everyone who believes in your high sense of spirituality, including the people of Jerusalem.
I believe that by 2022, we shall have the new Jerusalem in Akwa Ibom state. This shall be a fulfillment of the promise.

Say bye-bye to NARD strike forever,https://punocracy.com/say-bye-bye-to-nard-strike-forever/,2021-11-16T06:07:03+01:00,"By: Faridat Musa
As you know, Honourable Minister, the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) embarked on an industrial strike action weeks ago after several months of prior notice. The conditions put forward by the aggrieved doctors were quite fair and reasonable. Prompt payment of upwardly revised salary and allowances, better facilities and infrastructure, employment of more doctors; basic demands, nothing extraordinary—by now, every union should know better than to do otherwise.
NARD strike or threat to strike is frequent as it is certain. ASUU can only dream of matching up. Even though the strike has been suspended, we can bet on these doctors to withhold their services again because they clearly did not inherit the silence of their predecessors. With bills to pay, mouths to feed, and Toyota Corollas to purchase, it seems passion and love for humanity are simply not enough.
As lives are at grave risk and medical education is halted whenever these strikes occur, it is necessary to take all possible steps to avoid them. If not, every strike call-off marks the countdown to the next. If I may proceed, here are some of my recommendations;
Every now and then, you remind us that Nigerian doctors are treated better than their counterparts in the diaspora, especially those in Canada, Australia, and the UK. You claim our hospitals are state-of-the-art. We may not frequent foreign hospitals as much as you but we know enough to disagree. While specialist doctors in training in the UK receive £35,000 per annum, resident doctors here have to plead to be paid $5,000-$6,000 and other meager allowances. I do not want to imply that you are a liar but you hardly tell the truth. Pay the doctors and promptly so.
Passion doesn’t pay bills, never has, and never will. This wishful expectation of passion and love for humanity is tired and begging to be left alone. There may be some level of satisfaction that comes from working solely for the sake of humanity, but it surely isn’t monetary. If not, what is the conversion rate? Is it tax-free and inflation-adjusted? And sir, how much passion pays for your foreign medical visits? Medical tourism?
While I await your answers, endeavor to pay them real money. As you do so, resist the urge to reach into their accounts to take back (read: steal) their allowances like you did with the residency training fund.
You have reiterated on separate occasions that our hospitals are highly equipped to manage come-what-may conditions which is another brazen lie. Pardon me, anotherdeliberate misrepresentation of facts. Again, not your fault. Out of sight is out of mind; out of mind is out of use; and out of use is out of suffered experience. For your information, an average gym in the UK has a functioning defibrillator whereas teaching hospitals here in Nigeria lack even an obsolete one.
Months ago, a surgeon collapsed on duty and couldn’t be resuscitated because the nearest defibrillator was in the Government House. World-class doctors like ours deserve to practice in an environment that is not actively trying to kill them and their patients.
Being a doctor means one is exposed to a long list of life-altering diseases. You, of all people, should understand this; the feeling of mistakenly piercing yourself with sharps used on HIV or Hepatitis B patients and your whole existence flashing before your eyes. And for what? ₦5,000 compensation? $9.5? In case you too are unaware, the hazard allowance for doctors is 5000 monthly. There are faster and trusted ways to kill people you don’t regard—just carry gun.
If the increment cannot be implemented, reduce the volume and risks of their jobs.
I have to admit this wasn’t my idea. Your colleague and Minister for Health inspired it when he questioned the need for hazard allowance because he believes all doctors did to combat COVID-19 was “measure temperature.” Since this is his perceived and unofficial assumption of medical practice, he might as well file the paperwork and make it official.
In the end, everyone wins; less hazard allowance from the government, fewer risks taken by doctors.
The best time to recruit those “surplus doctors” you swear we have is now. We are no longer interested in asking why you insist Nigeria has an excess of medical doctors, even though the statistics are clear; each doctor is overwhelmed with nearly 5,000 patients. The next best time to locate those extra hands—that only you can see—is before the NARD issues another strike notice. As someone whose education suffers, I humbly beg that you ensure these strikes become a thing of the past.
Not many people are informed of your medical background, you would be reminding them by returning to the fold. For one, the Medical and Dental Council has use for an extra ₦40,000 in licensing fees and developmental levy.
Secondly, seeing as you undermine the efforts of doctors, you should practice in any public hospital of your choice. When you resume back, you can finally sack all the doctors as you threatened during the just suspended strike. After all, too many hands spoil the broth. On the positive side, you will be giving them time to pass foreign licensing exams and increase our remittance funnel.
In an unlikely event that you, an incredibly agile Nigerian leader, feel overburdened, you can call on our supreme leader and dictator-in-chief for assistance. He is hardly experienced at anything—except illegal use of brutal force—but he will learn on the job like he does with the country and excel at it. You two will make a formidable team, the type to revolutionize our healthcare system.

Married women should mind their homes (not their husbands),https://punocracy.com/married-women-should-mind-their-homes-not-their-husbands/,2021-10-29T10:06:09+01:00,"By: Winifred Òdúnóku
As a woman, you don’t have to like your husband. You don’t even have to know him in advance. You just marry him.
In addition to that, you must also be found an unspoiled virgin. You must curl your legs together in feminine modesty while sitting, and bow your head while talking to your husband.
If you must work, only sell the produce
from your vegetable garden on market days. Do not think of starting a trade.
Your husband owns you, just like God does.
And you are to satisfy his every need – physical, emotional, and sexual. No
objections.
Master calling him “Dim oma” or “Nna anyi” even when he is not being a good husband or father. Make sure to always swoon over him to let him know that, without him, you are nothing.
As a man, you don’t have to consider her age before marrying her. You just make your intentions known to her people with due diligence.
You are to give her children and food; she is to cook and bear the children.
If she gives birth to just girls, – remember that this is solely a product of her own making – do not fret or even work too much. Just marry your daughters off as soon as they are ‘ripe’, and rest assured that you would soon become the richest man in yourumunnabefore you know it.
If she proves to be a woman indeed and fills your dwelling with boys, then you can take parenting seriously. As soon as your boys start walking, do not allow them to stay at home with their mother anymore – you must teach them how to become strong men, and just that they’ll be.
If all things go well and she gives you twice as many boys as girls, please go ahead and respect her. Call her endearing names like “Onye nkem” or “Uso’m”, but do not use these pet names too often. You don’t want her to get used to them and start being jumpy, or else just address her as ‘woman’ stressing on the M-A-N so that she knows that, without you, she cannot come to be.
As couples, you can both temporize calling each other “Obi’m” … until your first child arrives. Then you must immediately substitute the pet name for “Papa Uche” or “Mama Uche” as the case may be. There must never be a public display of your love, or lack of it thereof.
Bottom line is: you must tolerate each
other for the children. Just for the children.
Then if you feel like it, marry a second wife, a third, and maybe a fourth in quick succession. Blessed is the man who can extol the virtues of his manhood and command a league of wives effortlessly.

How to be a successful SU(G) president,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-successful-sug-president/,2021-10-24T10:01:28+01:00,"By: Ayodimeji Ameenat
Did you just win the Student Union election? Are you clueless on what to do? Don’t fret; there is a manual. This guide will lead you to become a successful SU executive.
To focus on being a good executive, the first thing you have to do is destroy your manifesto or delete all copies of it. You won’t be needing it. It didn’t help you win the election and it won’t be a yardstick in determining your success. If, during your administration you’re asked about it, say how you appreciate that question and go ahead to  tell them how the weather is. Also, mention how you appreciate the support you’re getting. Without it, you won’t have been able to successfully do nothing.
The next thing after tearing your manifesto is to start your book. Write on how your manifesto was unattainable. Be emotional. Blame it on juju.  Reference facts that are undisclosable. Don’t forget to mention how hard you and your team tried.
After you’ve torn your manifesto, take courses on how to write beautiful broadcasts and official releases. You will be needing it a lot if you want to sleep peacefully. Is there a problem? Write a BC, put off your phone, then reward yourself with a nap for a problem well-solved. You need the nap to look good in pictures too.
Perfect your smile, you will be needing it for your photo ops. For every event you attend, caption the picture with something beautiful. Being the president with the most-attended events is an achievement. It shows your attention is on the people.
Be a keen observer. Observe all the things going on in your administration. It will cover up for your lack of problem-solving skills. After your tenure, advice your successors. Tell them the problems you faced and hope they solve it. Mention the problems in your book and wish the coming administration a successful tenure. Everyone wants their successor to do better. To ensure this, do the bare minimum.
Be friends with freshmen. Smile with them. Eat with them. They will talk well about you and promote your image. They will also ascribe countless successful projects to your name. They will talk about how you’re the best SU official, how you’re always there, and ready to solve every problem.
Try not to get in trouble with the press; they are bad market. And if you do, get your friends to write statements on how incompetent they are.
Being an SU(G) executive is not easy, but being a godfather is. When you’re done with your tenure and your book, retire and step into your office of godfatherism. You worked for this.

Job creation: Udom’s weapon for poverty alleviation in Akwa Ibom since 2015,https://punocracy.com/job-creation-udoms-weapon-for-poverty-alleviation-in-akwa-ibom-since-2015/,2021-10-21T07:45:14+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
Amidst Akwa Ibom leading the country as the country’s cleanest state, there are other staggering achievements the state has made since the current administration came into power. The facts, whether formulated or not, are there on the internet for views and confirmation. And whether or not these achievements are true, all you have to do is believe.
Today I choose to write on the area of job creation and employment in Akwa Ibom state.
People should commend the employment conditions of Akwa Ibom. Udom, a perfectionist, has set a very working strategy, which all the departments have not hesitated to comply with. Even the writer doesn’t  know the kind of strategy he has set, but all I know is:there is a strategy.
If you like be a graduate, if you’re not highly qualified for a job, you’ll remain at home. This government is not ready for any form of unprofessionalism. Ask those who took the examinations for teaching work. Most of them scored high but weren’t employed. Why?! They weren’t professional enough to be interviewed. Things like this cannot be known by flesh.
Currently, Akwa Ibom is one of the states where nobody is owed. I do not stand to be corrected. Verifiable or unverifiable, you ought to believe what proceeds from the government. This statement is no exemption.
Meanwhile, the report that saw Akwa Ibom as one of the highest in unemployment rate was false and satanic. I applaud the state government for coming out through radio stations to disclaim such a disrespectful fact. We don’t care if it was true or not. You can’t say this against a state that sprinkles industries in almost every corner of the place.

UPDATE: Hottest place in Hell now reserved for Lekki Massacre deniers,https://punocracy.com/update-hottest-place-in-hell-now-reserved-for-lekki-massacre-deniers/,2021-10-20T08:38:00+01:00,"INFERNO HQ (The T.A. Report)― The guest/inmates list for a VIP section in the hottest part of Hellfire has recently been updated, making it the exclusive reserve of people who deny that extrajudicial killings happened on October 20, 2020, during the End SARS demonstration.
According to a leaked document obtained by The T.A. Report’safterlifecorrespondent, denying that peaceful protesters were killed despite clear evidence to the contrary is not only a sin of sycophancy, secondary murder, and stupidity, it is pure evil.
This paper believes the Lekki Massacre deniers will be sharing the burning block with holocaust deniers, top Nazi commanders, Grade A serial killers, Olympic looters of public funds, and those involved in the extra-judicial murders themselves.
“We have always wondered what we would do with this special section. But with news coming in from Nigeria, the answer just came right at us,” a Hellfire spokesperson, who asked not to be named because he wasn’t authorised to speak, told us. “It is funny because we already consider Nigeria one of our major outposts. Like, have those people not suffered enough?”
We understand that one of the features that distinguishes this section of Hell from others is that experimental punishments for some of the other inmates are first beta-tested here.
When we reached out to Nigeria’s propaganda minister, Uncle Laye Mohammed, with our findings, he did not hesitate to dismiss them as fake news.
“It is as fake as claims that there was any massacre in Lekki on that day,” he insisted. “Not a single live round was fired. Those red stains were from paintballs and the startling sounds were from special drums beaten by members of the Nigerian Army Band. Not a single soul was killed, I tell you.”
Uncle Laye added that the only thing that would make him shift his position is if someone were to show him a 360 degree virtual reality footage of the event while also providing the permanent NIMC cards of the victims or if there was proof that any important person was accidentally killed, “such as a politician’s child”.
Meanwhile, somewhere in Hell:
Caveat: Note that this piece is a fictional satire aimed purely at humour. The words above are nothing but products of a drunk writer’s imagination. We hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the results of anyone’s credulity or mischief. Do not take us seriously. We repeat; do not take us serious! … On second thought though, maybe you should do just that."
My state is God’s dwelling place,https://punocracy.com/my-state-is-gods-dwelling-place/,2021-10-16T09:48:26+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
One may ask why I do not write satires about Akwa Ibom state. You may wonder if my avoidance to do so is for my safety. It’s simple. I don’t do so because Akwa Ibom is a perfect state. Perfect in all ways. This statement is not to paint Buhari and his administration as imperfect.
After walking through several streets in Uyo (especially places like Urua Ekpa, Udoette, etc.), I ask myself why a sane man should in his best sense criticize Udom Emmanuel. I consider people who ridicule the affairs of Akwa Ibom and its present administration as ignorant of how unlawful and heinous it is to criticize a religious government.
I am a core son of Akwa Ibom state and everything about my state is attached to God’s name. This is where faith resides. That same God is here and he has chosen to use Udom Emmanuel for our good. Some people only read the letters of the Bible with no sense of pragmatism. Was is not our Governor whom, through the leading of the spirit, gave our Fathers of Faith 50 million naira for breakfast? Even the Bible blesses a man who sows into the life of a man of God.
I see pictures of structural developments everywhere. Evidence of the Government’s resilience about the growth of the state is becoming more glaring by the day. Shame to those who act blind. Blessed are those who praise without seeing or feeling whether it is there or not. The fast growth of the state is solely dependent on the strict adherence to good morals by our leaders. You can’t lead as a Deacon and the people wallow in sin and destitution.
It is better to be ranked second as state with highest number of school dropouts than have no infrastructural development. Build a twenty one storey building and let the children leave schools. After all, what would their going to school bring to the state? Would it bring the Vice President to the state for a flyover commission? Would their going to school even bring him again to commission some temporary roads and buildings? Like, how would one dare compare the future of those dropout children to the praises the state receives from the lips of the Vice President on the constructions he has seen and commissioned.
I am not writing this to proof or bring to your notice all the Governor of Akwa Ibom state has done. If it interests you to know, make a move to plaza or waterfall at Nwaniba road. Everything is displayed, both in pictures and visuals.
Lastly, if you’re hungry, keep the hunger to yourself and stop disturbing His Excellency as he is going around distributing peace to all the local government areas. This is not a regime of money spreading. You had better die of hunger than let our money go to waste.

"Dear Police, thank you for being our friend!",https://punocracy.com/dear-police-thank-you-for-being-our-friend/,2021-10-16T09:36:32+01:00,"By: Olayide Oluwafunmilayo Soaga
Dear Police, thank you for being our friend!
What is friendship without a cordial relationship and a mutual feeling of love between both parties? Ever since the Nigeria Police Force was established in 1930, they have been the best friends of every Nigerian. Just like an apple a day keeps the doctor away, seeing a police officer sends the fright away.
Our amiable friends dutifully discharge their responsibilities with a smile plastered on their face. They’d be willing to be deployed to Sambisa Forest to combat the Boko Haram insurgency if it was part of their contract because of the undying love they have for us — their friends.
To make our friendship a blissful one, our friends created units amongst themselves. The most famous of this unit is SARS — Special Anti-Robbery Squad. This very efficient unit was created to tackle robbery and have helped to eradicate the crime in Nigeria.
Since robbery is now a thing of the past, they decided to add another task to their list — curbing internet fraud. In an attempt to fight internet fraud, they made every citizen of Nigeria their friends, particularly  millennials. When they see male millennials living their best lives with iPhones, laptops, or adorned with piercings and dreads, they exchange pleasantries and politely ask to search their phones and go through their gallery because they love pictures. In a bid to appreciate them, millennials staged series of protests so that the Federal Government could disband them. However, the government merely upgraded their status.
Our friends deserve to be crowned with an award for the best police force in the world. Even the New York Police department or the Vatican Police do not measure up to them. When there is a robbery in your street and the robbers are equipped with sophisticated ammunition, dial their emergency line and you’ll see them come to the rescue in all their glory minutes after the robbers have successfully carted away the loot and wrecked whatever havoc they have in stock. Their Ferrari-Toyota Hilux van is the fastest in the world.
They graduated with a 5.0 CGPA from the University of Hard Work. They are the true definition of ‘it pays to be hardworking.’ Because of their hard work, drivers hand them cash gifts. Or why do you think drivers hand police officers money if not as a token of appreciation for warding off bandits from the federal highways? They deserve a standing ovation for being the reason Nigerians can travel without the fear of being kidnapped or being attacked while travelling.
When it comes to friendship, our amiable friends are not always sure whose side to choose — our side or the people on the other side; criminals. They collect cash gifts from everyone. It’s really tough for them because they are the real MVPs and they don’t know how to reject offers. The same way they collect cash gifts from you is the same way they collect from others. Since there is no way of telling a criminal on the run apart from a law-abiding citizen, they can not discern who is who. So, when you are attacked  by bandits, don’t blame our friends because they simply do not know. Jesus has already asked for forgiveness on their behalf when he said, ”Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.”
Our friends will never detain a Nigerian citizen unlawfully because they know it will sully the friendship that exists between them. What they rather do is pick their victims (friends) up from wherever they are, cruise with them in their Ferrari-Toyota Hilux while having a conversation about how good the weather is, then later drop them off at their station where they would be until the universe aligns for their victims (friends) and they can go back to their family. They do this not because they are corrupt. Far from it! They do this so they can strengthen our friendship. You don’t even have to worry about bail. It is free just as inscribed on the walls of their stations. All you have to do is to visit them with cash gifts.
The citizens of Nigeria are eternally grateful to you for doing the Lord’s work. Continue to aid and abet crime. I mean continue to be hardworking and diligent police officers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We appreciate you for being our friends too. Cheers to many more years of friendship!

And thy Lord hath revealed a new thing about full house husbands,https://punocracy.com/and-thy-lord-hath-revealed-a-new-thing-about-full-house-husbands/,2021-10-13T08:00:24+01:00,"By: Adedimeji Quayyim Abdul-Hafeez
Brethren,
This day the Lord drenches my beats in visions. This pulpit has proclaimed the Lord’s goodness and happenings before they occur – from the scores of football matches to how presidents of different countries would die before the months of the year run out. In the Prayer Room before I mounted this altar, the Spirit downloaded the visions and updates my revelation in new software to preach the gospel of full-house-husbandism. No dictionary deciphers the language of the spirit, ladies and gentlemen. Only the Lord’s chosen are shown the miracles in the haven of thy Lord.
The Lord has heard the woes of your suffering. Seeing Okada men jiggling their bikes for dredges of petrol as the fuel pump runs out and filling stations looking like ghost houses saddens the heavens. The handwriting of your suffering reflects and I have come to preach the message that my Lord is a good and rich Lord.
Brethren, divorces are on the high rise in
this House. Husbands now show their strength by beating their wives to
demonstrate their superiority. This is against the order of the world. Look at
Delilah who used her wisdom to conquer the strength of Samson. We should not
incur the wrath of the daughters of Eve. We should dedicate our to the Lord’s
work by fulfilling their wishes in servitude. Amen?
Brethren, the first code to sustenance and heavenly blessings is to call your wife “Mummy”. Enough of the “darling,” “honey” nonsense. Do the house chores and keep Mummy happy, okay? What good does the world offer when Mummy is not happy?
When Mummy is going to work, do well to wash her car. Cook food for Mummy. See Mummy off. Bathe the children. Show thy enemies that your bond was made from heaven. Put them to shame for they said your bond is shaky, cauterized in the altars of Idanre Hills, not in the white kingdoms of heaven. Take care of Mummy’s wants and watch the bounties of the heavens shower on your being.
Women are good finance managers. Put your
money in Mummy’s hands and you are sure that they are in good hands. Collect
money to fill the gas. To buy provisions. The riches of thy Lord embellishes
his creatures who fulfill his wishes.
On this note, I would sound in a note of
warning. The society would try to coerce you into not “loving” Mummy.
Your relatives would tell you about being under fetish spells of Mummy’s
babalawo. Tell them you are only a servant fulfilling the Lord’s work. Heavenly
Fire! You shall fulfill the wordings of the gospel. No weapon fashioned against
you by your enemies shall prosper. The will of the Lord shall come into
fulfillment.
The Lord forbids promiscuity. Beware of
this, brethren, for we are all fulfilling God’s work. Don’t be a Zaddy by
sharing what belongs only to Mummy. The Lord abhors such. Switch off those
hotspots. Do not allow these acts truncate the real hustle. Amen?
Esteemed Lord’s servants, these commandments do not apply to me, for I am a servant in the Lord’s vineyard. I am the Lord’s chosen. My jet is fully insured in the Lord’s blessings, while your rickety bikes still need the Lord’s mercies and wonders. They apply to you — a being full of sins. Take to the Lord’s commandments and you shall be blessed.
People of of the Lord, enemies would want to truncate the spiritual hustle by criticizing the extent of these commandments to yourselves and not to me. Remember, I am the Lord’s chosen. Ye do not know the purity the spirit fills me with using the Lord’s embers. I’m free from sins. You glow in sins. That makes the difference — I am free from your glow and you glow from what I am free from.
Eeeiii. Shabadukabar. Do the Lord’s commandments not choke?
Receive glory. There is someone in this
gathering looking for admission, and by the power of my heavenly fathers, the
person shall get it. My Lord does not watch his servants suffer. My Lord does
not act in vain. Amen?!
Brethren, abide by my Lord’s commandments, and start a fulfilling career as full-time house husbands. The Almighty is tipping the balance, to show us that destiny lies in the hands of our Mummies. Do this, and this nation is on its path to prosperity.
Grace,
enshroud me. Blessings, ooze all over me.
Amen.

Dear Mr. Kid Napa,
It is a well-known fact that your creative business is the most lucrative — from how you think of the best ways to hold people without their consent to how you demand that their people pay outrageous amounts of money. What a genius you are.
It is also true that the unemployment rate in this country has risen dramatically and, as a result, you have distinguished yourself by devising such a novel method of earning money. I mean, we all want to be able to feed our families, drive the latest car, wear the latest clothing, and throw a talk-of-the-town kind of birthday party for our girlfriends, but you were able to achieve all of these things using your innovative income-generating methods.
I know you have a kind heart and it is never your intention to make others cry, but what needs to be done simply needs to be done well.
My neighbor and his girlfriend had a
disagreement the other day. Even though others are doing more, he couldn’t
afford to purchase her the latest iPhone for her birthday, which was
embarrassing. Can you believe it? I wouldn’t blame my neighbor if he decided to
work in your industry the next day, week, or month.Shame go catch you too na.
Again, I understand that you entered this profitable industry in order to make rapid money. Yes, I understand. To spare you the embarrassment of requesting an urgent 2k. Instead, you’d rather be asked.
However, as a potentialkidnappee, I am also a human being with demands that are specific to when you want to kidnap me.
First and foremost, I don’t want to be caught unprepared, so I’d like to be able to take a badass photo and post it on my family’s and department’s group chats, as well as on Twitter, with the caption: “I’ve recently been kidnapped; you may only use this image of me as a missing person and not another.”
I’d also like to be chauffeured
around in a vehicle other than the ones that have been associated with your
industry. I want to be able to use my phone because I don’t want to lose out on
any intriguing tidbits on Twitter that we can both enjoy. You know you don’t
want to be bored. Is it possible for you to give free WiFi as well? You will,
of course.
I’d like to be well fed. I’m not
interested in the normal biscuits, water, or fizzy beverages. I’d enjoy it if I
could have rice and beans with soft meat and chilled yoghurt for breakfast;
bread and egg for lunch; and hot amala with ewedu for dinner.
I’d like a working television, a good comfortable bed, somewhere that smells lovely and doesn’t smell like urine because it wouldn’t be nice for people of your calibre to host me in an uncompleted building. Also, I’d like to see you, my darling kidnapper, nicely groomed. You don’t have to appear rough. Spend this money!
This is not something too much to
ask for, even God said we should ask and it shall be given; I hope you will
consider all I have written. It will be nice not to call my people because I am
not the only child and I am already a handful. They could care less, and please
remember to notify the government if you decide to leave your industry and seek
employment elsewhere.
They would first parade you on television, feed and clothe you if you are in poor condition because you happen to be among those that could not make wealth out of your industry. The government would also certainly send you to a vocational training center so you may learn a skill. You would then come back later to inform the Nigerian people that you have repented and proceed to find a job (or, rather, get one provided on a platter by the authorities).
They must show you mercy because you have assisted them in producing what they could not — job opportunities — by recruiting people under you into the industry and developing new sectors with varied roles. They wouldn’t lock you up or make you suffer as they do for individuals who seek their rights; instead, they’d congratulate you on being a good comrade.

An open letter to whoever hacked Facebook,https://punocracy.com/an-open-letter-to-whoever-hacked-facebook/,2021-10-06T08:04:40+01:00,"By: Ahmad Adedimeji Amobi
Hello
World-Most-Revered Hacker,
I have
come to force myself to believe that after God, you should be the next person
to be worshipped. If truly you hacked Zuckerberg’s services, he himself should
make sure he finds you and implore you to manage a very important role at
Facebook.
For
the brief hours of Zuckerberg’s services blackout, your magic transitioned a
lot of things to happen. Hacking Facebook and other services literally means
you’ve captured people’s attention to talk about you. I mean, a lot of people
ran to Twitter to catch up with life, including Nigerians, with VPNs, whose
government has shut them out of Twitter. What else do disciples do about their
God? When it’s time for them to worship Him, they put other things in blackout
and submit themselves to Him. You could sneak into their privacies and set the
condition to accept you as their God before they could access their social
networks.
The first group of people you commissioned were the evangelists. Those that rushed to Twitter and started tweeting about what it means to live in a dark world. That do we imagine ourselves fading into the arms of death during those brief hours? You’d be shocked, wouldn’t you? You didn’t know you could pique that kind of thought, right? Yeah, that’s the power of being the next thing to God.
I mean, who doesn’t know Mark controls the world after God? That if he decides to shut down his services today, majority would suffer and feel lonely and become something, if not really, close to dead? But Mark wouldn’t do that, you know. He can’t imagine himself interning in another tech company when he’s out of cash.
But the most unfair thing you did to people, which also affected me, was that they almost lost their lovers.
I was actually chatting with my girlfriend on WhatsApp when the blackout happened and my girl had texted ‘I love you, babe’ expecting me to reply with ‘I love you more, sweet one’. I replied but my message didn’t deliver. And my lover is a little bit brass; she controls our relationship. If she tells (orders) me to do something and I refuse, she would phone call me and start making a list of girls she caught me talking to, girls she caught me hugging and girls she caught me texting but didn’t get angry because she loves me and I am doing anything possible to ruin this relationship despite how much she is investing in it. Until she saw the circular on Twitter by WhatsApp, she told me to write I love you messages to her on WhatsApp and Instagram’ Direct Message and Messenger. Well, I had written epistles on Messenger and WhatsApp before she called me not to worry.
But personally, I have some ideas you might never think of. Are you on Twitter? Do you have a verified account? If yes to my first question and no to my second question, you should consider doing this: go on Twitter and announce to the world that you hacked Facebook. Look, Jack and Mark are quite not on good terms. So don’t worry about Twitter sending you off.
Rather, within an hour or two of liking and retweeting and quote-retweeting, Jack would give you a badge and you would get followed by Twitter Verified. Are you worried Mark would come for you? Never. You are the world’s most revered hacker. Hacking his services means a lot to him. He fears you. The only thing he could try to do is denying you access to his services. And you know what? Hack them all, again.
Yours
truly,
Ahmad Adedimeji Amobi.

Nigeria’s just 61. Cut her some slack.,https://punocracy.com/nigerias-just-61-cut-her-some-slack/,2021-10-02T10:36:46+01:00,"By: Maryam Olajide
In life, things begin to make sense when you put it in perspective. As a child, you must have heard and read a lot of stories about Nigeria, stories from third parties, stories from biased people, cooked up stories from the pit of hell. So here’s Nigeria, giving you a chance to hear about her, from her.
At first she chose silence. However, she changed her mind upon deep reflection of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s words:
“When you are a public figure, people will write and say false things about you. Many of those things you brush aside. Many you ignore. The people close to you advise you that silence is best. And it often is. Sometimes, though, silence makes a lie begin to take on the shimmer of truth.”
So here’s  Nigeria,  finally deciding to let you in.
Nigeria was a young girl, who was unconventionally forced into a  union. A union done solely for the commercial benefit of her masters. Why then will you place the burden of the success of such a union on her?
She’s lived all her life trying to prove her worth, make things work, to become a reckonable force despite her background.
When people talk about their disappointment about her, with deeply rooted disgust, about the things that could have been, you’ll think she’s been in existence for longer than usual. I mean, she’s just 61? What’s life without mistakes?
In fact, Mary Tyler Moore once said, “Take chances, make mistakes. That’s how you grow.” A lot of people want to reap the benefit of growth, but they are not ready to put in the work. Growth requires sacrifices  —  and this includes sacrificing your rights, freedoms, and entitlements.
How sad it is to realize that Nigerians, the sole reason of Nigeria’s existence, do not rate her. From planning an insurrection against their God-ordained leaders to publicly disgracing her reputation on a social media app; their unruliness is endless.
Have you seen them speak or write about Nigeria? They make it seem like it’s the capital of the world’s problem. For an acclaimed spiritually-oriented people, one would expect them to know better.
There is power in words and how they’re written. They should, therefore, know that stories about insecurity, bloodshed, terrorism, unemployment, banditry, corruption, police brutality, kidnapping, and poverty should be told usingantonyms. This way, a clear image of the Giant of Africa is portrayed. But, they never learn, and that’s why they keep jumping from one problem to another.
On a final note, remember: No matter where youjapato, you’re still a descendant of Nigeria, and her blood runs through your veins. 💀
Happy In Dependence!

"Femi Fani Kayode, the Man of the Year",https://punocracy.com/femi-fani-kayode-the-man-of-the-year/,2021-09-20T08:15:39+01:00,"By: Ajíbádé Abdullah Adéwálé
Good day, Ladies and gentlemen. On today’s occasion, I present to you the Man of the Year: a man who has been consistent with his actions, a man of integrity, a man of choices and words. Distinguished Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Chief Femi Fani Kayode.
It’s a pity this man hasn’t gotten a standing ovation yet, even after his sacrifice for this country. Is this how Nigerians reciprocate good deeds?
Moving forward, it’s pertinent to read the citation of today’s awardee and I shall begin from the current to the past. Fellow Nigerians, please pick your pens and notepads for this man has got a lot that you all must learn from.
Chief Femi Fani Kayode, being a man of choices, made the headlines again as he has always done. He announced his defection to the respected political party and was humbly received by Nigeria’s president, whose tenure has successfully sailed the economic ship of the country to the Promised Land.
Our Man of the Year had once described this political party as darkness and said he would rather die than join. Well, since the country can now boast of a 24-hour power supply, the political party is no longer darkness and it won’t be a crime to join. I commend the chief for this open-minded decision.
Meanwhile, instead of Nigerians to celebrate the action of Mr Integrity, all they do is criticize him. Why would anyone castigate Chief Femi for his decisions? Just why? It is a known fact that he is a man of diverse faces and choices and he makes use of them at will.
The worst of it is a statement attributed to a former president pointing that as long as you provide our Man of the Year food, he will eat and then sing for you. I can confirm that this is a fat lie. Chief Femi neither eats much nor does he have a degree in Music, let alone knowing how to sing. Besides, there is a difference between singing for and merely praising or thanking your benefactor. They go so low by calling him a political prostitute and political panhandler. This is unacceptable! I think it’s high time the chief sued whoever defames him. What nonsense!
Let me quickly point out that our awardee, at a press conference a few months ago, celebrated a journalist for asking him who was bankrolling him. Oh! Chief Femi did so well in that regard. While everyone was expecting him to get angry because they believed the question was not appropriate, Chief Femi remained calm and even appreciated the journalist with unhealthy attributes. Now tell me why he shouldn’t be our man of the year. Indeed, he is a man who is not hot-tempered at all.
Here is a great opportunity for IPOB and Sunday Igboho, as the chief, their major spokesperson, has met with the president and stated their agitations and what solutions to proffer. Don’t be surprised that the issues will be addressed in no time. Our Man of the Year deserves more credit that he is getting from Nigerians.
To succinctly put forward all that I have iterated and going by the tenets of the Yoruba culture that places utmost importance on respect for elders, of which I belong, I would not like to neglect this beautiful part of my culture: Thus, I respectfully pronounce Chief Femi Fani Kayode as the Man of the Year for his consistently inconsistent loyalty and display of good deeds.
Don’t you want to be like our Man of the Year?

Understanding gynophobia: The fear of women,https://punocracy.com/understanding-gynophobia-the-fear-of-women/,2021-09-15T08:09:15+01:00,"By: Ukor Jonathan
“One thing must kill a man,” right?
To survive this world, you must understand “gynophobia” — the big grammar which refers to the fear of women. Basically, the morpheme “gyn-” relates to anything and everything feminine. Like gynolatry (the worship of women), gynocratic (government by women), gynosutra (sexual etiquette for women), gynaecologist (a Ghanaian female doktar), and gynnastics (an all female gymnastic event). The last three were made up, but you get the point, right?
Historically, the fear of women has often been overlooked, and so great a downfall befell those who underestimated the powers a woman wields.
Just consider, “grand-premiere-superman” Adam of Biblical memories. In one episode ofAdam loves Eve, Eve secretly connived with a talking serpent under an apple tree to usurp the government of Adam. The next episode, the aftermath of a failed coup, sees Adam losing his divine speed dial with the Creator, and farming to feed. Pathetic, the first man debased to farming!*sobs.*
Or consider the altercation between Joseph and his master’s wife, Mrs Potiphar, who seductively danced in slow-mo towards him. Joseph, “wise guy, not gay” (definitely not gay), refused to dance, and fled for safety to the prison. Ironic, right? A man finding safety in bondage.
Also consider Samson, “the great and mighty” Samson*sobs*. Delilah must have something a thousand men don’t to effortlessly shave off a fine “dada” man to “gorimapa”. In English: she succeeded in cutting his dreadlocks until he became bald (and blind) and dead.
These are pieces of biblical evidence to #FearWomen. Trend it.
Forget history! What can history teach? History has never really saved future disasters, has it? There would be more wars, more deaths, and especially more breakfast to be fed.
Consider Baruwa, “young-fine-loverboy” Baruwa; he wouldn’t have guessed in a thousand years that juicy Sniper would be his last poison. Baruwa, too, like “the great and mighty” Samson underestimated the power a woman wields. In English: he fell in love. And, of course, it ended in tears.
Or consider Don Jazzy, “happy-cheerful-puppyish” Don Jazzy; he still hasn’t gotten over billionaire Rihanna. If he doesn’t get her, he’ll rather remain unmarried. Sad, old Don Jazzy. Don has been in and over, infatuated with Riri; the spell is unbreakable.
Also consider Nedu of Wazobia, “triple ethnicity” Nedu; he could roleplay as Ade, Musa, or Chinedu, but clearly does not understand the language of a woman. Poor Nedu. He underestimated the matriarchal world and trivialized the modern-day definition of marriage. “You husband a woman does not mean you alone would father her children.” Get on track, Nedu. It’s a changing world, and feminism is what a woman says it is.
Lastly, consider the majority of heartbroken men who choose to be strong after every breakfast. After all, “men don’t cry.” We men, “muscular-chivalrous-promiscuous” men, are yet to understand gynophobia; the more reason we underestimate it. Forgive me for generalizing, but the message is clear, “ṣọra fun obinrin.” In English: every woman owns a Lasso of Hestia capable of binding a man to her will, and she will use it without mercy."
Six ways to know first-time undergraduate lovers,https://punocracy.com/six-ways-to-know-first-time-undergraduate-lovers/,2021-09-06T07:59:19+01:00,"By: Ahmad Adedimeji Amobi
Aunty, Uncle, I know you might have
forgotten those promises and those things you and your first lover promised
each other as undergraduates. We are here to remind you.
In 100 level, there was this your friend that had a lover and jested at you because you didn’t have. The second day you and your lover agreed to date each other, the first thing you did was broadcast. You would intentionally leave your phone screen on and drop it beside that your friend so as to see your wallpaper and ask, ‘Who be this?’ And you would answer, proudly, with this simple smirk and sprinkles of blushing on your face, ‘Na my babe be that.’
Remember, both of you had assumed that you would eventually marry each other. So, a week into your relationship, one of you would start asking about your family. ‘How many brothers and sisters do you have?’ ‘Where are your parents from?’ ‘I think I should meet that your brother o, I like how you describe him.’
Because your relationship is fresh
and you had told your friends about it, you both would promise to marry each
other, have two wedding cultures; white and local. The type of attire you would
wear. The city you both would settle in. Yon don marry now?
Ha, this part. If one of you loved watching romantic movies, one likeFifty Shades, he or she would ask, ‘Babe, where do you want us to go for honeymoon? Dubai or London?’ You would pick one, even when you hadn’t paid your school fees. You wouldn’t mind because this kind love sweet na.
See, you weren’t dumb. Don’t think you were when you remember the number of kids you promised to have. There would be a day you’re chatting on WhatsApp about your younger ones, how troublesome they were. And the conversation would swerve to love for kids. You would ask, ‘Do you love kids?’ Your lover would say yes. ‘How many do you want us to have?’ ‘Just four and oh, I love twins.’ Shey bi you guys yaff see the future already?
Na this part I pity una most. You know your friends bought gifts for their lovers, and your lover’s birthday was approaching. You started racking your brain about their favorite things you’d discussed. You would tell yourself to buy something, something special. Birthday would come, you would buy the gift and your account balance would start blinking red light.

Buari swears to apprehend perpetrators: A short address to Nigerians,https://punocracy.com/buari-swears-to-apprehend-perpetrators-a-short-address-to-nigerians/,2021-09-02T07:37:27+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
Fellow Nigerians,
Governors of all the states,
Nigerian Army headquarters,
I have decided to pen this address not because I am not intelligent or sound enough to air it, but because of the recent power failure caused by lack of solar which may hinder plenty Nigerians from being reached. This may look unusual but such are the ways of a highly intuitive and innovative leader. Bear it in mind that everyone shall be reached as this address shall be translated into every language for the benefit of those not exposed like the few of us here.
I write this address with utmost sincerity and I plead with every Nigerian to reason with me. Nigeria remains our own. We are working tirelessly. Shun critics — they will feed on their shame soon.
Sequel to the recent killings in the country which have incited an uproar in many hearts, leaving millions of Nigerians in doubt of their safety, I want to first of all apologize for not being aware of all the incidences that may  have occurred — the NDA invasion by gunmen, Plateau killings, that of Akure, and the rest. This is what an average President wouldn’t do but I don’t mind. I am here to serve you. Sincerely, if I had known, I would have used my power as the commander-in-chief to stop those miscreants from their evil acts. Also, in this short address, I want to once again assure you with my blood of your security as a Nigerian in Nigeria.
However, before I continue, as a professional road driver, you have to observe your side mirrors to be sure you don’t drive into anyone coming from behind. This is what my administration has never failed doing. I blame the past government for this insecurity issue that is suddenly trying to creep into the nation. And you should too.
The federal government remains resilient in making the security of the citizens and their properties a top priority. This is evidently seen in the country considering the fact that I have deployed army men to all the states in Nigeria to halt the destructive efforts of the enemies. More so, to states that need more peace, residents in Jos can attest to this profound truth.
Notwithstanding, I have organized my men to combat the Talibans and so restore peace and salvation to the Afghanis the way I did to Nigeria in 2015 when I heard their wails of Boko Haram here and there, banditry, kidnappings, fund diversion, etc. Insha Allah!
Therefore, I urge the soldiers, parents, cadets, and all Nigerians to keep calm, remain loyal and law abiding, and also go about their legitimate duties and work without the fear of gunmen, bandits or insecurity — as normalcy will be restored sooner than thought.
I admonish the Nigerian army to be careful as they carry out their duty. It is required of them that, as they go in there to strangle crime, no blood should be shed without proper verification of who they truly are even if they are caught with illegal arms. This is to avoid unnecessary killings. I urge them not to take laws into their hands as the perpetrators and sponsors of those who trespassed the NDA premises shall be duly fished out and brought to book accordingly.
To those who may attempt to develop any form of self-defence mechanism, I beg you to avoid such as all your battles shall be fought from the Villa.
I have instigated this and many guiding philosophies to protect Nigeria:
I am the same yesterday (1984), today (2021), and beyond. I am the unchangeable changer, the convener of women in the oza room crusade, the apostle of 1960 grazing routes.
Once again, long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria! LongleaveNigerians, home and abroad!

Will Nigeria do something about growing insecurity? Of course.,https://punocracy.com/will-nigeria-do-something-about-growing-insecurity-of-course/,2021-08-26T07:49:38+01:00,"By: Halimah Adisa
The world is at its feet and it is just 7:30 am. Taliban has taken over Afghanistan and, in Nigeria, Bandits are taking over the Defence Academy. Should now be a good time to clamp down on insecurity?
The Nigerian Army is not a robot despite its sensitive awareness to protect the nation from insecurity. They are the hope laid before the citizens — the ones who protect themselves alongside their families.
They have fought battles for the country and that’s why we still have few pillars standing. They might not have conquered andkilledShekau, but their torment could have also been a reason for his suicide. I mean, they left a mark on him. Even a lazy man with no zeal for anything but sleep appreciates the excellent works they have put together over the years.
Bandits may take over the academy and replace it with chaos and talks. They may walk away killing and abducting officers and getting ransoms, exploring Taliban tactics. But will the government go after them? Yes, they will. They will motivate them with gentle words and set workshops for them to repent and they will provide them jobs because only strong men enter a lion’s den and still come out strong. They will realise how bright they’ve shown to have gotten the recognition of the state.
Meanwhile, the president whose lust for power and his country’s resources will be sitting in a room watching tapes from his daughter’s wedding.
Infuriated citizens will rant and the fear of unsafety will take over their thoughts. To leave their state to another might involve not just paying a fare to the commercial drivers but paying a ransom to the commercial terrorists. They are afraid of the nights that were once for rest and moonlight stories. Even stars are scared they might be plucked and sold.
Who is bold enough to enter the NDA? Bandits! They will say, “This is our nation and we can do whatever that pleases us.”  Now let’s get to the talks they left while raiding.
On the 24th of August, the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna, was attacked by bandits and they killed people andabducted a senior officer.  It has trended on the Nigerian Twitter with the hashtag #NDAAttack. Thoughts were shared by tweeps that this could be their way of exploring the Taliban’s game.“Let’s shake and crumble their defence academy, then move to Aso Rock and crumble the rocks to sand.”
Former Naval Commodore Major Kunle Olawunmi, while speaking with Channels TV, indicated that some serving senators, governors, and friends of the president sponsor banditry …
The CDS, General Lucky Irabor, expressed his grief like a boy who cried wolf. “This madness must stop,”  hecried.
Afterrantsfrom Nigerians, NDA spokesman Major Bashir Jajira came out to assure the entire populace that the abducted personnel would be rescued and the bandits would soon be apprehended. As usual, they would probably enroll them in a vocational training centre and come in few months to announce to us that “they are now repentant bandits.”
And how do you rescue a dead officer? By going the traditional way — calling his spirit to fight for his country against terrorism.

The different shades of Nigerian rice,https://punocracy.com/different-shades-of-the-nigerian-rice/,2021-08-24T08:03:54+01:00,"By: Gbemisola Ibrahim
Where I come from, rice is a must-have meal at home. As an original bred Nigerian, you must eat this food at least three times in a week or you die. Our existence depends on it. It is the air we breathe.
Rice, a food that can be made in different colors and flavours, is a necessity in Nigerian parties. God knows what your aim would be if you are planning a Nigerian party without a form of rice or the entire rice menu at your party. Is that how things are done? Didn’t your parents teach you good manners?
This rice, I must tell you, is a boring food. When it is cooked plain white, you would think about getting your stew or sauce with a bottle of chilled  Coke to fulfill all your stomach’s dreams with a satisfying belch.
For me, the best form is the jollof rice. Oh my sweet sweet jollof. It has the power to make a crying baby do a double take. Its color red or orange, depending on how well the cook communicates with the invisible world, is a sight never to be forgotten and the only smell that defeats physiology. It is permanent and heavenly especially if it is covered with smoky steam leaving one’s mouth empty of salivation.
This food will
determine how well your party succeeded by the end of an event because party
jollof will either make or mar you. Choose wisely!
It shouldn’t be heard that after accumulating debts for a well-to-do party, your guests went home hungry or did not eat enough party jollof. Dear friend, avoid solicited curses.
Jollof rice is at its best when scooped from the bottom of the pot. It is a lifetime experience, one you have to work hard for. You have to put on a wide and not-too-flashy smile on your face to persuade whoever is in charge of the best part of this rice not to add soapy water to the mix.
It is quite ungodly
that one has the tendency of acting like a thief when you see leftover jollof
rice the following day after a party. Most Nigerians have sold their lives in
exchange for this taste of fulfillment and some Ghanaians would dare compare
the Nigerian jollof with theirs?
As I mentioned
earlier, Nigerians literally eat rice everyday. This is awesome news because
the hospitals will earn more capital and her health specialists will have more
work to do and more money to spend, of course.
Where I come from, before you complete the word “Sick,” everyone has already screamed “God forbid; it will never be my portion.”  They will refer to all the chants, Qur’anic and Bible verses they know on an issue their subconscious can’t deny. The habitual eating of this food can lead to a variety of risks and they come in flavours such as Constipation, Type 2 Diabetes, Inflammation, heart diseases, amongst others. To top it all, one might not be able to afford the healthcare. We are living a cheap life in Nigeria; just that Nigerians itch for expensive things that can cause death. Ever heard of “something must kill a man”? If you haven’t, you haven’t met a Nigerian.
Due to how Nigerians abuse the staple food, our fathers decided to ban its importation to bring a boost in finance, job security, and the love for Nigerian-made rice to her citizens. I promise, Nigerian rice is absolutely stone-free.
Currently, imported rice is still very much in the country. How it got here is God’s doing. No man can achieve such feats. To crown it all, both the local and foreign rice have now become a burden. Some Nigerians can no longer afford daily meals, talk more of rice. What exactly is the plan? Who is constricting our airflow?

Nigeria’s many good news: A brief commentary,https://punocracy.com/nigerias-many-good-news-a-brief-commentary/,2021-06-10T12:20:04+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
My heart leaps for joy each moment I hear of the name Nigeria. The name comes with good news to fill a sad heart with excitement.
Here, I shall briefly speak on the following topics I deem important.
Like my friend, Utibeno would say, today is not a speech-making day, so straight to the point:
Gone are the days we had dumb leaders who never had initiatives on what to do in their position. Gone are the days a leader would hardly be innovative towards building a dream nation for its inhabitants. Nigeria now has a new set of leaders transforming it into paradise.
Irrespective of the past and recent events in the country, I vehemently believe that our friends abroad and Nigerians in diaspora are still desiring to be in Nigeria. Some may not be bold enough to say this but I know their minds. They miss a whole lot. The dramas, the tears, thrilling headlines, and many more a government could offer it citizens.
1. Legalization of cannabis; economy booster.It is a beautiful innovation for a country like Nigeria to think towards this direction, all for the growth of the economy. This is not to say our economy has been kicked out as one of the best in the world; this new idea we’re about to imbibe is to maintain the standard. It is to maintain the position of the second-best economy in the world.
Countries like Spain, Jamaica, etc. who’ve legalized the sales of weed are not better than Nigeria. If Jamaica could make it through the sales of marijuana, then we too can. We can join them in selling it. Through this, economic growth is sure. I am sure the House of Representatives have deliberated on it. Smart people! I stand with them. We shall see boys smoking on the streets, in churches, clubs, schools, without fear of police. We have no other means to boost this economy than sell weed.
It is only religious extremists who would frown at this wonderful evolution we are set to experience at a time like this. Such are the real enemies of this country. But they will never succeed this time, amen!
2. Youth corps members to be deployed for war.The DG should be given double promotion for such an extraordinary initiative. My God!
So Nigeria had this kind of idea yet we’ve been allowing these small boys called hoodlums and Boko Haram to thrive in their operations? Who didn’t know corps members were capable of going to Sambisa forest to fight terrorists?
Who even told Nigerians it was the duty of the army to go to the forest to combat Boko Haram? Some Nigerians can’t think well at all. The duty of those army men is to keep sand-filled drums at checkpoints to scrutinize your cars and belongings. Their duty is to safeguard places like toll gates and also to shoot those who dare to trespass.
It is rather the social, civil and divine obligation of the corps members to fight any form of insecurity that may ravage the country. N33k is enough to risk your life as a Nigerian Youth Service Corps member for the security of Nigeria. The three weeks training given to the corps members is enough to prepare them for war. The police can operate from their stations. Please never feel bad when a good idea like this is birthed. It comes for your own good.
3. Change of name from Nigeria to UAR.The problem of Nigeria (that’s if Nigeria has any problem at all) is not its leaders. It’s the name. This is rare knowledge. It’s both simple and revolutionary. The leaders are good. They have tried their best for this country. Trust me, I’m saying the truth. I’ve seen their hearts. All the problems we have had are because we never had something like ‘United’ in the name of our country. Can’t you see the peace and unity in places like the United states of America, United kingdom, and United Arab Emirates? Its because of the names they bear.
Hallelujah, we’ve found a lasting solution to any form of disharmony. It’s in the name. When the name is changed to UAR, Boko Haram and ethnic rivalry will end, roads will be fixed automatically, we shall have uninterrupted power supply, hardship will vanish, our climate will change for, and even our complexion will change. Behold, the United African Republic!
4. Twitter deletes Buhari’s tweet; an abomination.I have never seen an insult and abomination as great as this. How dare Twitter delete Nigeria’s number one citizen’s tweet? What’s their concern with the nature of the tweet? Buhari’s tweet is covered with immunity, whether genocidal or not, it doesn’t deserve a delete. You can joke with other Presidents like Donald Trump but never with an Ex-General like our President. Whether he violated the rules of Twitter or not, they should have swallowed it and allowed the tweet remain.
Jack Dorsey and his team have bitten more than they can chew. Buhari should summon him for trying to make a mockery of him. Is it because Buhari doesn’t have a WAEC certificate? Is it because he managed to use his social media platform? No, Jack has many questions to answer.
5. FG bans Twitter in Nigeria; the best action.
Perfect! A welcome development. Which other action would one expect a wise government to take than this? I know many will say it’s an act of dictatorship. Others will say the President is a tyrant. Who cares? Some will even say it’s a violation of the citizen’s constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression. And I ask, is Buhari not bigger than Nigeria’s constitution? Must he obey everything therein? If he does, then why is he the President? Doesn’t he have the right by virtue of his power to rewrite or act in discordance to what is written there?
Nigerians should arise and fight for the dignity of their President.
Moreover, I am glad no one messes with our President and goes free. Jack Dorsey has received his share of punishment. Have you not noticed that his stock has depleted since Buhari banned Nigerians from using Twitter? His followership has reduced drastically. He is no more making his money. In fact, with the way things are going, if Buhari continues with this ban, his money will finish in the next seven days. He’ll be poor. Nonsense boy! At his age in Nigeria, he’s supposed to be a sycophant preparing for the next electoral campaigns.
On this note, owning a Twitter account or its app on your gadget is now a criminal offense. You will be prosecuted for it. Security men shall begin to scrutinize people’s phones to be sure they are not violating the order by Buhari. Please avoid questions like, ‘How about top government officials who are still active on Twitter?’ ‘How about those whose source of livelihood was Twitter?’ etc. Such questions are irrelevant to the government. You are only an ordinary citizen. Besides, what’s the concern of the government with your hunger? Sorry… I meant to say, what have they not done for your survival as a citizen?
I know you may be thinking why bandits, herdsmen, hoodlums, unknown gunmen, kidnappers, and Boko Haram are walking freely while Twitter users are seen as threats to the country’s security and economy. Avoid this kind of thinking, it doesn’t make you rational.
The only medium of making peace in the country is banning Twitter. At least, violence and terror will end. This is so relieving.
6. Unknown gunmen, kidnappers still trying Buhari’sLongsuferringness
How many times have the FG not killed the terrifying Shekau? Wouldn’t it serve as a warning to these boys threatening the security of the country? How many times has the government not paid ransom for those kidnapped, negotiations upon negotiations. Yet they have refused to let Nigerians rest with their nauseating behavior. Okay. Wait until the emerging NYSC warriors are unleashed; maybe by that time they will respect themselves.
Yesterday, a man called a radio station to pour encomiums and sincere praises on the government and its leaders for all they have done since they came into power. I was super excited at such a magnificent gesture of gratitude. A cow does not know the significance of its tail until its cut off. Nigerians may not acknowledge the importance of having Buhari as a President until he leaves. Thank God the use of Twitter has been banned; let me see where you people will use the hashtag #BringBackBuhari.

How do we appease the general?,https://punocracy.com/how-do-we-appease-the-general/,2021-06-06T08:14:18+01:00,"By: Ajíbádé Abdullah Adéwálé
With the situation of things, the General needs to be appeased with six kegs of palm oil and an unblemished female dog, with fresh palm wine.
Wait! But the citizens of this country are ingrates. After all that the kindhearted general has done for them, they had to provoke him to such an extent that Jack, a non-citizen and an innocent man, would have to stretch his back and appreciate the favorable lashes of the General.
Well, now that they have gotten the General angry, he has started communicating in the language they understand; a language even the deaf can hear. Who will help them appease the General? They brought this upon themselves!
By the way, I wonder why the citizens of this country would step on the toes of the General when he has fulfilled 99.9 per cent of his promises and still vows to do more.
The media keeps promoting untrue events to stain the photoshopped image of the General. Why would they lie that kidnappers and terrorists are on a rampage when the General is keenly doing everything to put a stop to it in the language the kidnappers and terrorists understand?
They are blind to the fact that kidnapping has reduced drastically and terrorists have willingly left the country. They even donated their weapons to aid the security agencies of the country in their fight against protesters. Why have they chosen not to report this act of patriotism?
One dollar is now equal to one Naira. The improvements of the healthcare sector have made the General not to travel to receive treatment abroad unlike many other presidents. Through the money being distributed in markets across the country, many of the market women now have shelters. And the poverty rate of the country has dropped to the barest. All these, among other positive developments, yet the citizens of this country do not give the General the accolades he deserves. What else do they want?
Many of them are even calling for the resignation of the General. This gets me laughing. Where has it occurred that a “General” resigns, not to talk of a progress-oriented general?
Well, their actions have gotten the General angry, and he is communicating in the language they understand. Should you not be aware, the General is a polyglot who treats each situation with a distinct language.
Now that he is angry, how will they appease him?
Perhaps we can go for the chief priest’s suggestion by getting six kegs of palm oil, an unblemished female dog, and fresh palm wine. If it doesn’t work, the General will have to continue ruling beyond the next election. Fortunately, he is a kindhearted man and the people may not even want him to leave.

A hungry man is an angry man, but you’ll find a man angrier when the food he’s offered brings dissatisfaction rather than the opposite. The consumption industry is fast catching up with the construction industry in terms of utilising gravel as a raw material. And it appears the stone the builders rejected also got steamrolled (or parboiled), sacked (in 50kg bags), and became the corner stone of our weekend breakfasts. You probably narrowly escaped one this morning.
With the sheer amount of stones chewed (and/or swallowed) in
the past few months, the digestive systems of a lot of us should have begun
evolving gizzards, if Charles Darwin was right about that popular theory of
his. Anyways, we are already losing our teeth (and our bite) in our next step
towards evolution into chickens. And while one could gamble the rocks are
likely to reduce with time, it’s safer to hedge that bet by having, via natural
selection, a dentist or two among family and friends. But this rice we’ve been
eating cannot lay any claim to be “chicken feed” because one, it is expensive,
and, two, even chickens prefer corn the last time I checked.
Nigerians have resilient constitutions but these stony staples are stretching our immunity and community, rather than keeping them bound. Picking rice is now similar to panning for gold, and that seems quite apt since they are both harvested in swampy regions – and lakes.
The scarcity of food that can be chewed from beginning to end without one being extra careful is a problem for which pap is a solid solution – or a fluid suspension, depending on how it is prepared. Hence it is up to those of us who subscribe to this notion, the responsibility of applying it to the largest scale attainable. And this cannot be attained individually but as a single unit. There lies the onus – on us.
A manifesto should be launched with a “Table of Contents” but what happens when the writer is not content with what is on the table for lunch? What happens when the food for thought cannot be sifted through in order to find any value? – It might rather be dismissed as pap. However this time around, the value is in the pap.
Lovers of pap, unite!
Lovers of pap, coagulate!!
Lovers of pap, be congealed not concealed!!!
The time has come as it has become necessary for us to collectively turn over a new leaf in all sectors, from the grassroots to the green shoots. First, we need to get the seeds planted in the right conditions, and stalk the growth until the tassels are moved from each ear – like a graduation ceremony – and the cycle is completed (and restarted). But it all begins in the nursery.
For instance, we believe that “A for Apple, B for Ball…” as
recited by kindergarten pupils should contain “P for Pap”, and for that reason,
we adopt “P-‘4’-PAP” as the identity of our organisation. The full meaning
might change with the times, but the catchy acronym which is alphanumeric to
ensure a stronger password to our servers – and to deter hackers – should be
retained, especially for our upcoming tasks.
Having observed that the process of getting into the right positions requires lots of reforms, the first step is to institute a level playing (or “planting”, as the case may be) field for all. And just like harvests should be fairly commensurate with pollination, polling results should be a proper reflection of the vested interests of the populace. This is why our first incarnation would be in the guise of Pap-lovers for Proper Addition of Polls (P4PAP). It might sound quite corny, but since collation is basically addition, how difficult could that be?
This feat could be achieved easily by mass mobilisation of
agents to go round every polling unit in the 36 states, 774 LGAs, and thousands
of councils in the country. They would only be required to transmit the results
declared by the Presiding officer by uploading them online to our social media
platform, Whats-pap from Maize-book (not to be confused with Zuckerberg’s).
Computers could compute the computations from there.
Once our structure is firmly established in almost every council district in the country, we would register with the electoral commission. Just as pap is popular throughout the country, regardless of weather and climate, P4PAP would also become a household name. In fact, our logo would be a bowl of pap. The only ideology we would have would be whatever guarantees the surplus of corn, millet and other pap-making grains and condiments in the market. Some people blend their pap with ginger and we are quite gingered for that as well.
Registration would be on the condition that we are granted the following waivers. Number one would be the permission to have our alphanumeric acronym on the ballot. Two, the location of our headquarters should not be mandated upon us. We could remain virtual, or we could decide to build an island on the Atlantic using all the sand and stone pebbles found in our meals. The final and probably the most important: Drinking of pap at the election venue should neither be counted against us as brandishing of our emblem nor as campaign during election. Man needs nutrition, and it is not our fault that the electoral commission doesn’t provide refreshments for its events.
All these have to be in place as soon as possible so that we can quickly actualise our great vision for the country when we get to the helms of affairs. The fundamental plans which we hope to achieve include the official renaming to “Nigerya” because it is an anagram of the word “grainey” – among other more sensible geographic reasons. Another thing we’ll change is the flag. The appearance would remain the same but the colour labels would then be “Gren, Whit, Gren” – the “e’s” would be eased out – so that the pronunciation would be similar to “Grain Wheat Grain”. These and more give a feel of our awesome ambition, if given total unwavering support.

“The fact is that in 1973 … the government of that day came out with a decision that what will prevent another civil war is to ensure that anybody born after January 1970 has free and compulsory primary education. Regrettably that administration was overthrown two years later and all the lofty ideas and all the preparations that were needed to ensure that every child of school age acquired free and compulsory education were jettisoned. And we are paying the price today because if you have 13.2 million children of school-age out of school that is the market which Boko Haram, bandits, IPOB and other militants, that is the market where they recruit people.”
Lai Mohammed. April 26, 2021.
I totally agree with the minister’s position on the current setbacks in the country. I know there are many doubters out there who wouldn’t agree with this point of view. Absolute sceptics! Doubting Thomases.
When Murtala Mohammed overthrew Gowon on what was said to be bloodless coup, didn’t he know the repercussion that would follow 46 years later? Even Obasanjo who was made his deputy didn’t advise him on the consequences that would spring up in the next 45 to 46 years?
I blame that 1975 coup d’etat. We are reaping what Murtala had sown. He had sown seeds of  insecurity, of bloodshed (even though the coup was bloodless), of bad economy, of hunger, of nepotism, of ethnicity, even of money embezzlement. And now all we reap is corruption which our amiable President has vowed to fight against. See what Murtala’s greed for power has fetched us. Insecurity!
Yet some people would go ahead to heap blames on Buhari. Yet some would even count him incompetent without knowing the spiritual effect of what happened in 1975. Please join me as we put all the blame of this regime’s failure on the coup.
Lai should be ordained a Prophet for such an uncommon revelation.

If bandits could kill these ones, it doesn’t mean there is insecurity in Nigeria. Believe me. I tell you the truth. These common bandits are only trying Buhari’s patience. See, that he is long-suffering doesn’t make him a coward o! He will fight o! He will crush them all o! He still has his military uniform o!
I have sworn to sew the mouth of any careless-speaking Nigerian with thread and needle who will talk down on Buhari concerning insecurity.
Shame to those who thought Nigeria would not make headlines. Shame! Shame to those who thought Nigeria with all the wealth amassed by politicians would still go ahead to take loans from other countries. Shame! Shame to the skeptics who thought Nigeria’s economy under this regime won’t grow for better. Shame! Shame to those who believed killings won’t stop. Shame!

How Nigerians keep sabotaging themselves,https://punocracy.com/how-nigerians-keep-sabotaging-themselves/,2021-04-28T12:54:03+01:00,"By: Maryam Olajide
The bane of
Nigeria’s issue presently can be traced to apathy and the unpatriotic attitude
Nigerians have over the years showcased to the world. What they don’t realize
is that no one will take you seriously if you don’t take yourself as one. Not
only do they blow seemingly little events out of proportion, they are never
grateful for the actions of their leaders.
Recently, news broke out that the Nigerian Hair Force “allegedly” killed over 20 Nigerian Harmy personnel by airstrike. It is important to note that no one is above mistake; moreover the news has to be properly investigated before we state whether it is true or not. We are not God, so do not expect us to have access to every information related to our work. Why do you have to put us on such a high pedestal? “Na you overrate us, Na you still dey talk say we no meet expectation.” “You sef con do am if e easy o.”
Some weeks back, Twitter subbed Nigerians with their chest. Such a delightful news to hear! They announced their decision to set up their Africa head office in Ghana. This is what you get when you wash your dirty linen in the public. To be patriotic is to suffer and smile, to see injustice and look away, to cover up bad atrocities, and to sometimes deprive yourself of your fundamental right. It is not everything that the eyes see that the mouth must tell. Well, we can say you’ve all learnt the hard way.
Twitter’s decision, according to reputable “Dr. Lie-Mo”, is the fault of both citizens as well as the media which exaggerated the challenges faced in the country. At no time was this worse than during the #EndSARS protests when Nigerian journalists, both traditional and new media, were trying to outdo themselves in painting Nigeria as a hell where nobody should live. These sets of people conspired to vilify the government, and yet they are the ones who suffer the consequences.
According to reputable Dr. Lie-Mo, “When you destroy your own house, where are you going to live?”
Does it matter if the said house is inhabitable, unsafe, or not fit for human existence? The answer is No!  Nigerians have to be grateful they have a house at all! This is exactly what you get for not being patriotic. Imagine the kind of job opportunities you would have had, the exposure, access to other international offers and so much more.
They surely didn’t reflect deeply enough to realize that it is what the insiders say about their country that the outsider will use to judge.
To admit to reality, as a no-nonsense government, Twitter could be sent packing anytime, if their actions negate our principle of governance. Imagine, they had the mind to state that Ghana champions democracy and there is adherence to rule of law in the country. Such an unfounded statement!
As a government, we do not want criticisms, although we admit to our imperfections, which could sometimes cost you your life, or opportunities.  What we do not want is you broadcasting them for the whole world to see, because in the end, you’ll be left to suffer the consequences, as you’ve always had.

Nigerian cows to get CIN,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-cows-to-get-cin/,2021-04-26T07:41:54+01:00,"After an hours-long deliberation with taxpayers money, news broke on 25 April, 2021, of the contemplation of the Nigerian legislature to enact into law the creation of a database to take a census of and register all cows within the territorial borders of the country.
To achieve this, it was proposed by the lawmakers present that these cows be issued Cow identification Numbers (CINs) in similitude to the National Identification Number (NIN) already being issued to natural persons in the country.
The primary essence of this database is to enable the nation identify the best stock and breed of cows for fightinggidigbo. A proposed national bloodsport which will see a variety of cows lock horns in death matches.
The legislators affirm this would attract much needed foreign exchange into the country by boosting the revenue generated from tourism as the novelty of watching cows gore and maul each other to death ingidigbois sure to attract international attention.
More so, cows who fall due to the inability to withstand the high-stake pressure ofgidigbo, will be used as suya and kilishi for tourists to take back to their countries.
Another advantage of the proposed database is that it’ll become an avenue for youths to make money as breeders, trainers, referees and pundits.
The database will further allow youths who own betting accounts to trace the bloodline and family history of their proposed cows to see if they are a sure bet.
Cows captured in the database have been proposed to be classified according to the following metrics:
It has also been touted in some circles that the cows may be classified on whether or not they have facial scarifications.
Cows not registered within seven days of the coming into force of this law shall be forfeited to the Federal Government.
Despite this laudable initiative of the Nigerian Legislature, prior to us going to press, #AllCowsMatter and #CowLivesMatter movements were already springing up all over the country denouncing this great and inspired move."
Job advert: Kidnappers wanted. No experience? No problem.,https://punocracy.com/job-advert-kidnappers-wanted-no-experience-no-problem/,2021-04-26T07:31:14+01:00,"Are you a poor Nigerian who is angry at everything and everyone, especially rich people or even unassuming members of the middle class? Are you able-bodied but would rather make free money than earn some of your own? Do you sometimes daydream about wielding great power or accessing the legendry national cake through an unscrupulous backdoor?
Then you might just be the perfect candidate for one of our countless openings for kidnappers atDonkwa Boys Inc.
You’d have noticed that we could not get this advert into a national daily. Surprisingly, kidnapping is still considered a crime. But so is being in possession of money and luxurious items, and no one has ever arrested a policeman for abducting people guilty of that.
You do not need to have prior kidnapping experience. We have a robust internship and mentorship programme that will ease you into the job.
Our gang (sorry, company) was formed in 2018 after our visionary founder, Donkwa, lost his entire family and house and herd of cattle to an invasion by a neighbouring community. Haha! Just kidding (but that is the story if any journalist asks you). Leader Donkwa merely saw the potential in the business, seeing as Boko Haram was raking in millions from kidnapping young students.
The most interesting thing is kidnapping is the only business where everyone is your target market: whether they are rich or poor, natives or foreigners, Muslim or Christian or atheists, civilians or politicians or military personnel. It doesn’t matter; as long as they have people who care about them and can pay ransom for their release.
It is also one of few businesses that is not regulated by the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) or the Consumer Protection Commission. We don’t have to register with the CAC. There is no quality assurance, insurance, or money-back guarantee. Sometimes, we even collect ransoms for people who already died in our custody.
You have nothing to worry about. We have a strong working relationship with all arms of the security infrastructure, from the Civil Defence to the Nigerian Army. They even supply some of the weapons we use and conduct regular training for our members on how to maximise resources and evade arrest. At least 20 per cent of our IGR goes into sustaining this relationship.
One thing that stands our company out from the rest is our Corporate Social Responsibility and gender-sensitive policies. We do not low-ranking members to engage in sexual violence. We do not collect ransom for unborn babies and only charge for the pregnant mothers. Only mid-ranking and top commanders can touch female abductees. Also, as a way of giving back to society, we do not strike on religious public holidays and sometimes give bonanza ransom packages for large raids.
Kindly note that we are constantly looking for independent contractors from other West and North African countries. So, please reach out if you’re confident you can work with us.
We also need informants who can give us information about the locations and movements of juicy targets. Rest assured that our commission rates are one of the most generous in the world.
What are you still waiting for? Take that bold step now; send your application to donkwaboys@yahoo.co.uk and we will reach out to you if we see potential."

When one of Nigeria’s leading politicians and president wannabes suggested a genius, yet simple, solution to insecurity in the country, the logic seemed to have flown over people’s heads. What should we do? Recruit a quarter of Nigeria’s population into the Armed Forces and then sit back and watch peace return to the land. You don’t see how this makes any sense? Well, here are 10 good reasons Jagaban’s brain deserves to be preserved for having such brilliant ideas and why nothing can best this suggestion in particular:
One, the fear factor: A mere mention of such a huge number constituting just one nation’s military formation will definitely send chills down the spines of many other countries, even those considered to be first world. Forget their heavy sophisticated intel and weapons. This will then let Nigeria pride more over her already sealedgiantshipin Africa and, eventually, in the world at large.
Two, it is a viable means to ending the insurgency. 50 million is really a huge number thatBoko haram no fit pai finish. They will only kill, kill and kill and eventually tire out of killing and finally themselves run away from the land.
Three, it saves unnecessary cost incurrence from buying sophisticated military arsenal. We won’t need to be wasting money on purchasing up-to-date weapons for our soldiers since there will be more than enough human beings to serve as cannon fodder.
Four, as a result of the point above, in some way, the uncontrollably growing population, now turning to explosion, will be checked. And when the population keeps getting checked to an extent, what’s not enough now regarding state resources will subsequently be more than enough because there will drastically be less people to look after such that every unemployed denizen will be placed on a monthly stipend. Nothing could be better.
Consequently, the country will effortlessly produce more and more fallen heroes to celebrate every Armed Forces Remembrance Day.
Six, our youth folk will realise the true meaning and essence of patriotism, the pride and joy in gallantly dying for one’s fatherland.
Seven, it is unequivocally going to be one good way of ending unemployment. Mind you, children of our political office holders won’t drag it with us; they’re fine.
Eight, our politically elected leaders will no longer have to be siphoning and mismanaging funds up to the point affecting the rendition of good governance. That is, there’s going to be enough, even more, to carry out electoral manifestoes and promises to people.
Nine, so, if financial corruption does not affect governance over citizens, we can then boldly say there’s no corruption in the land. Hence, that ugly word will be wiped out.
Ehn ehn,finally, that thing where a family who has a soldier son will be bullying some family that has no soldier son will be eradicated becausee almost every family in the land will have representation in the army. Isn’t that coolest thing? It is, right?"

Pontius Teenubew’s small frame competes with the dust he is gathering as he completes his passionate address to the Council of the Rich, “I can’t sell wine easily, because nobody wants my wine when Jesus can turn water to wine. Mazi Jonathan can’t sell his fishes, because this Jesus can multiply them. Look at Healer Adamu, nobody wants to see him when they can wait for Jesus. If we don’t end Jesus now, he will end us!!!”
Teenubew’s voice echoes across the room and Prius Fashowlah, the most renowned carpenter in Jerusalem, collects the gathering silence and returns a voice to the Council, “How will anybody patronise me when this small boy’s father is in the same business? They want to be good in his book. Even Aeesh went to Joseph’s workshop to make a sofa that she did not need. What kind of–”
“Ze you want to address ze issue at hand or you want to fight me?” Moh Bwari, a military General with a history of cruelty, said from across the room. “I will deal with Aeesh when I return home, let us pocus on ze issue at hand.”
“He called himself King of the Jews, that’s treason isn’t it?” Shanwoh Loohoo asks. Loohoo is Pontius Teenubew’s wine apprentice who became Teenubew’s favourite after he discovered a solution to get people drunk even faster, causing them to spend more money for lesser pleasures.
“Instead of fighting him head-on, and risking looking bad before the public and the courts, let us use our people to submit a public complaint that someone wants to take over the thrones in Jerusalem and carve a Kingdom for himself,” Loohoo looks around the room to be sure he still has their attention. “We just have to stay mute and pretend to pity Jesus. If anybody asks us anything about him, we can even offer to make a solidarity walk.” He lets the message settle in the room as he dusts his hem dramatically, before raising his eyes and a finger, which he points to Bwari, “I know you are angry sir, but all you have to do is nothing.”

Jesus’ brown skin is glistening against the sunset in Pontius Pilate’s court. Although Jesus had pleaded neither guilty nor innocent to the charges, Pilate had not found enough evidence to convict him of treachery. Fearing he may start an insurrection, Pilate said the case was a threat to national security and the final hours of the hearing would be conducted in private.
The room’s gloomy appearance was overwashed by Jesus’ smile. He nodded his head in agreement. Pilate, with a greying moustache and a bare chin, told Jesus as soon as the court was empty —except for him, the state’s attorney, other government representatives, emissaries from the Council of the Rich, and a friend of Jesus, Leenk Judas— that this was not a trial but a “conviction that was set before him.”
Jesus’ glowing smile reflected on Pilate’s bald head as Pilate spoke, “You have offended the wrong people and they have to teach you not to say too much, ask for too much, dream too much, or intrude their businesses.”
Pilate looked around the room for support, but only Jesus was nodding his head in agreement. “You will be sentenced to public flogging across the land so that people can see that you are not the King of the Jews, but only a lofty man with some weird socialist ideals. You will be hung in a place for people to see you as an example and to deter others like you in the future. I rise!”
***
Word went out before Jesus stepped a foot outside Pilate’s court. Variations of the judgement were circling in the air with vultures. The most common version of this was that Pilate had sentenced Jesus to be stoned across Jerusalem, before being nailed to a cross where he should be left to die as an example for generations.
Each member of the Council of the Rich donated resources to nail Jesus. Fashowlah’s workshop provided mahogany for the cross. Jonathan gave his suppliers a holiday, so there would be little trading in town to provide food or water to Jesus. Bwari supplied the soldiers who whipped Jesus till he bled, and made sure as little help as possible came to him. Adamu’s healers were also off-duty, and any healer who went to work was immediately marked for beating, through the help of Bwari’s soldiers.
Loohoo, however, walked with the crowd and told them he pitied Jesus, whom he said was “like a son to him”, but it was beyond his powers to do anything about it.
Judas, Jesus’ friend and only ally in Pilate’s court, was seen telling a group of people that Jesus was an insurrectionist who did not know when to stop.
Eyewitness evidence from multiple sources revealed that Judas was taken to the court on a chariot belonging to Teenubew, who has also been accused of instigating the trial in the first place.
Although Teenubew was quick to give a town-hall address that he was not interested in what was going on, other documents have revealed that he did not only provide the chariot for Judas, he also paid him between 2,000 and 5,000 Shekels.
Other documents used in this report were provided by whistleblowers who were present at the Council meetings, in Pilate’s court, and in other places. The identities of our whistleblowers will be protected, for as long as the death of Jesus continues to be a topic for discussion.

Nigerian man paid to fix local hospitals again runs abroad to treat himself,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-man-paid-to-fix-local-hospitals-again-runs-abroad-to-treat-himself/,2021-03-31T07:30:08+01:00,"ABUJA INTL’ AIRPORT (The T.A. Report)― Nigeria’s highest-paid civil servant, Mohd Boo-Harry alias Bad Boy alias Kilokanmi (What is My Business?) alias E Choke (?), has again dipped hands into his employers’ purse for a “medical check-up” in London even after being handsomely paid to upgrade the country’s health facilities.
In fact, Bad Boy announced his plan to see his UK doctors the same day resident doctors in Nigeria said they would be embarking on an indefinite strike — an occurrence many think could not have been a coincidence.
“It is as if Boo-Harry is either God- or Devil-sent to punish Nigerians and remind them of their sins. He is here to push us to the wall and then taunt us by asking why our shirts are stained with paint,” one analyst told our correspondent. “It is certainly a ghetto whatchu-gonna-do-about-it moment.”
Kelechukwu Afolayan, an expert on Kleptocratic Policies in the Global South, gave a similitude: “It is like you employed chef for your family but rather than cook for himself too, he collects additional money from you to order food from Chicken Republic and Kilimanjaro. Is it not food poisoning that will kill you?”
Meanwhile, Bad Boy’s most passionate mouthpiece, Femo Ade-sinner, has said his boss never promised to fix Nigeria’s ailing hospitals.
“That was not part of his job description,” he said with a signature straight face during a Panels TV interview. “The claim is false, apocryphal, and must have been fabricated by enemies of the good governance to distract us from the administration’s core objectives. Baba only promised to work on the economy, security situation, and corruption. That’s all. If you have evidence to the contrary, you are free to share it.”
“Besides, how can Mr President fix the hospitals if they kill him first?” Femo asked. “Let’s be serious for a moment and really think about it.”
Sources at the statehouse said Bad Boy was excited to finally be able to see his preferred doctors, whom he had only been meeting through Zoom calls because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is estimated that the taxpayers’ money he and his aides will spend to during the two-week medical holiday in the UK is enough to pay the resident doctors working on empty stomachs and pockets back in Nigeria and also build at least two standard secondary healthcare facilities.

"Obituary: Nigeria, where preventable deaths are cast in stone",https://punocracy.com/obituary-nigeria-where-preventable-deaths-are-cast-in-stone/,2021-03-23T08:13:43+01:00,"The kicking-of-the-bucket has occurred of retired Police Inspector, Simon Aakaaa. Figures emanating from the Confidential Statistical Archives of the Nigerian Bureau de Statistics have it that his sad event makes him the thirteenth million, seven hundred and eighty-five thousand, four hundred & ninety-second Nigerian to die froman unpreventablecircumstance in a year that is less than three months old as at the time of writing this.
For as you well know, unless the Lord prevent a death, no one can – even when God has given us the will and the means to do so and we neglect to do the needful. So, his death is one of those unpreventable ones even though we could have done something about it.
Big,
Bigger, Biggest.That was the pattern of his movement
from one hospital to another all in search of the cause of his ailment and
possible cure. In a bid to shame the naysayers of our health sector, our
medical practitioners recorded the same finding but to be double-sure they
transferred him to another medical facility, from that another on to another,
as if he were a piece of Naira note in circulation. The result of their
diagnosis was simple, clear, unambiguous and definite: “We don’t know what is wrong
with you; we will transfer you to a better facility.”
From Jalingo, he was transferred to a Specialist Hospital in Gombe where experts waited to remedy his health issue. But first, he had to travel on the infrastructural perfection that is the Jalingo-Numan-Gombe road. The comfort and joy that the bumps, potholes and debris on the elegant road offered him was a taste of what lies beyond this world. It is understandable that after leaving that road he went mute. Having tasted the good life that is obtainable beyond, no sane man would soil his chances to the afterlife with words of his mouth.
Though
dead, he lives on in our hearts and those he has left behind. He is survived by
wife, children, grand children and great children but predeceased the country’s
corruption, ethnicity, epileptic electricity supply, banditry, Boko Haram
insurgency, bad leadership, kidnapping and many other Nigerian acquaintances
who are doing well in many fields of our national life.
AsNaija no dey carry last, there’s therefore everything to miss. No doubt, he will miss this country. He will miss the zero delay in getting his pensions. He will miss the news of the good works being carried out by those we voted into power. He will miss listening to heart-wrenching news on the radio that have ceased having any effect on the masses. He will miss our efficient health sector, the peace and tranquility provided and guaranteed by the government, especially the perennial peaceful co-existence of Tiv and Jukun ethnic nationalities.
He is a jolly good old fellow who served in the Nigerian Police Force with dignity and integrity – a great feat! There’s no way a man of his goodness should live longer than he had lived,o wrong nau! It is our norm that we should allow the good die in suffering and unheralded, while the bad flourish like repentant militants, Boko-Haramists and bandits.
Pa Aakaa will be buried in a private family ceremony in his ancestral home in Benue State according to Roman Catholic rites. History has it that Nigeria has never been saddened at the death of any of its truly good citizens; I know this one will be the same. Or were you expecting me to speak in the future impossible tense that a small comet will be sighted at his burial? Come off it joor, let’s be real as we have always been in this country."
Exclusive: You-High to give up on virtual learning,https://punocracy.com/exclusive-you-high-to-give-up-on-virtual-learning/,2021-03-10T07:56:16+01:00,"Information reaching our quarters has it that You-High, the Ibadan-based university, will give up on its virtual learning programme, owing to repeated trials and errors that have failed to sustain academic activities.
A very competent source close to the VC, Prof Eekanna, says the university knows it can’t hold on to the virtual learning of a thing but remains adamant because all eyes are on her.
“You see, my brother, they know (referring to the sin-ate body) that the virtual programme won’t work, but they won’t admit it. Very soon the reality will dawn on them. Awon oniyeye,” the source stated.
The students are visibly angry that academic activities have not started but none of them is willing to bell the cat. Most recoil any time our correspondents attempt to have their opinion. “You see, I cannot afford to besdc-isedbecause we’ve not started lectures,” Bashorun Ogunmola (not real name) managed to say, amidst fits of cough.
As of the time of reporting, the university has not sent guidelines on how the virtual learning programme will work; it has only released dis-jointed statements on the resumption of learning activities which have puzzled the students the more. The fresh students are particularly incensed that they may not achieve the best of learning, and have written on their placards “3rd. Week. Of Resumption. Nothing. Nothing.” But they are afraid to actually stage a protest.
Another source who is part of the team in charge of the virtual learning platform, however, assured us that learning will start and that the students need to be calming down. “Everything is set. Virtual learning is the new-normal. We’ll embrace it. In fact, the students need to,” the source stated when our correspondents met him at his office. “The university cannot afford to make any errors. That’s is why it appears we are starting late,” the source added.
While our correspondents were about to leave, our source’s secretary called us behind, away from the hearing of her boss and said everything our source said was “lori iro.” “Iro ti po repete, oti po repete, iro po,” she sang as she sashayed her buttocks and danced back in."
Nigeria to set up insurance scheme for kidnap victims,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-to-set-up-insurance-scheme-for-kidnap-victims/,2021-03-08T08:36:23+01:00,"CENTRAL RANSOM REPUBLIC (The T.A. Report)―  The Nigerian government is set to launch yet another extraordinary plan to safeguard the lives of citizens from prowling bandits: the National In-Case-Of-Abduction Insurance Scheme (N-AIS).
“Think about it for a moment,” said the country’s defence minister Babachir Magaji during a press briefing on Monday. “We have to be prepared. Getting kidnapped is not a matter of ‘if’ anymore, it is about ‘when’. And it is not something that affects just one social class or ethnic group. Gaskiya, everybody is eating the breakfast.”
Magaji added that the government was tired of paying ransoms to secure the freedom of “cowards” who could not fight to the death to defend themselves from the bandits.
“It is better we spread the risk across the population if we want to save more lives. We should be our brothers’ keepers,” he said, adding almost inaudibly that some repentant bandits have shown interest in serving as insurance providers.
“To make this a success, we will generally be imposing a 5 per cent deduction in earnings and 10 per cent for residents of areas where kidnappings are most rampant.”
After Magaji’s address, Nigeria’s shadowy finance minister Zaynab Hameed, who office is partnering with the defence ministry to develop the scheme, enthused that no other country in the world has come up with such an innovative idea.
“We have started considering applying for loans from the World Bank and Chinese government too to support ransom payments,” she said, “because we understand that any country’s greatest asset is its human population. What is the point in building rail networks and bridges if everyone is held hostage and holed up in the forest areas?”
Mrs Hameed was asked what would happen to the scheme if the rates of abductions were to drop drastically in the future.
“Well,” she replied, “our analysts honestly do not think there’s a chance of that happening anytime soon.”
“But, if it does happen, then we plan to use the fund to service existing loans or we can just borrow from it to take care of our annual capital and recurrent expenses,” she added, a plastic smile forming slowly on her face.

How to live in Africa as an African,https://punocracy.com/how-to-live-in-africa-as-an-african/,2021-02-27T10:06:35+01:00,"By: Idowu Odeyemi
Copycatting is an endemic feature of an African who lives in Africa. And when you engage yourself with this African style of inauthenticity, let it be the western style that you will copy. Forget the west humiliated us with colonialism and some of them said “Africans cannot think” and forget that that means we don’t have our own pre-existing ways of doing things before they discovered Africa. (Discovered! As if we were water in the heart of a desert. But that’s what their academics say and some African Historians, too. Can people who discovered themselves be rediscovered again? Glory, Glory the west!)
So, here is your guideline towards achieving authenticity as an African after saved yourself from the humiliation of colonialism and derogatory remarks from the west:
1. Don’t wear beads:Wearing beads on your neck or around your wrist is diabolical and it could immediately give you off as a witch/wizard to your neighbors. And when a child dies in the street, you surely don’t want to be the prime suspect.So, Baba, dead that idea. Na ment!
2.Don’t wear a native dress (i.e Bùbá and Ṣọ́rọ́/Ìró):Even though you work in the Ministry of Culture, when going to office in the morning wear suit and a tie alongside a fine shirt and an ironed skirt/pants. Your job is not to preserve your traditional culture and maintain its heritage. Who are you to do that by the way? Minister of CultureabiOoni of Ife? You will only be depicting Africans as primitives if you wear African styled clothes to work. (Hopefully you get job sef. Who employs someone that wears Ankara to work? Well, you fit work for Palace.)
3. Don’t believe/worship ancestral gods:Because they are black and whiteness is the measurement we use for judging righteousness. Also, a white god passes judgment in the afterlife. Vindictive punishments await your soul if you do not accept whiteness as holy and black as evil. Your family members have already acquired charms to destroy your life from those gods; Jesus, now, is your only rescue. Go to church more than you go to work. Jesus fed 5000 people, how many is your body? Just one na.
4. Don’t protest against ill government:Protesting against a government or grotesque governance policies means only one thing to your neighbours: you do not have work to do. You should be hustling to buy that petrol you bought 145 naira yesterday 200 naira tomorrow. Day-to-day inflation is endemic to the sectors government controls. And even when the police kill your brother, you should never join the protest against police brutality because the wicked president might order the bodies of protesters to be fed bullets. Remember, you have drunk the elixir of life, and you won’t die again. Let the people that want to die go and join the protest.
5. Don’t order pounded yam at a restaurant:You will be labelled as ‘uncivilized’ by your own people and I know you don’t want to sound like a paleolithic human in a public space like a restaurant. God forbid you use your hand to eat while wearing a fine shirt and a tie.
6. Don’t speak Yoruba:Or any African language for that matter to your newborn babies; they will not be intellectually inclined. Fluent English is a paradigm for intelligence and your mother’s tongue is a vernacular. So don’t push your children to understand the African language. Speak English to them. Let them pronouncetby briefly seizing air from their vocal tract when the tip of their tongue presses against the tooth ridge;you will even be subconsciously preparing them for an English proficiency test. Speaking your mother’s tongue means you are uneducated.
7. In Africa, imitation is the only means for survival:So, when you get to a job interview, imitation will get you the job. Dress, walk and talk like Leonardo DiCapiro inThe Wolf of Wall Street. Even if your content is watery, just act western. That’s all, my gee. Africans don’t love deception, they just want to be sure they are hiring a white man in a black body.
8. Do not sing afrobeat:If you want to make money with music, don’t try writing or singing songs about oppression and bad government policies. Fela don already work for that area. Sing your Afrobeat and mix it with some hip-hop or pop gibberish. Don’t bore me with the nepotism of Buhari or the Lekki Massacre. I just want toGbese!I just want toShaye!Problem no dey finish.
I am glad you read through this entire guide for being an African living in Africa, and I know you are happy you’ve done six out of the eight; you’ve basically fulfilled an African dream. You’re wonderful.

How to show you are a genius in Nigerian varsities,https://punocracy.com/how-to-show-you-are-a-genius-in-nigerian-varsities/,2021-02-23T08:38:25+01:00,"By: Awósùsì Olúwábùkúnmí
You may be wondering how many days it will take people to recognize you like Albert Einstein —chill man.I am providing you with a guide that will help you be easily recognized as a genius in Nigerian universities.
1.Do not keep your clothes smart to your body:You see, ironing clothes, starching them or putting necessarygatorson your shirts/trousers are time wasters and, trust me, you wouldn’t want to waste your precious time on things that wouldn’t showcase the level of your erudition.
2.Do not have many friends:You came to this world alone; you don’t need to network. Remember, the beginning of socializing is the barrier to wisdom. You can’t afford to become so popular; such a state will only impede the time to study from morning till another morning.
3.Do not get social:This may look like the second piece of advice but it is different. As a genius, being familiar with the latest songs or fashion is the quickest way to divert your attention from getting a Nobel prize. You don’t want to care about that.
4. Ask questions even if you know the answers:You know you know the answer, but would it not be good if you made others see you as a god? As a Nigerian genius, you must ask questions that will push your lecturers off balance. This way, you will be the choicest in the eyes of the professor.
5.Read in obvious places:You don’t need to hide in places such as the Library or other unknown spots. Carry big books and read on roads, read while students are rushing, read in the eatery, churches, mosques, even a herbalist’s shrine. That way, the gods of the land will see how serious you are and grant you more wisdom.
6. Make sure to submit your answer sheets early: Don’t ever wait for the warning before you submit. Always submit before the warning. You don’t want to look cheap or even embarrassed with the invigilator’s “pens up!” Submit thirty minutes into the exam and even if you don’t know anything – the lecturers already knew your name, they will understand that you didn’t want to sit with others waiting, and you submitted early not because you didn’t know the answers.
7. This is the premium rule– Don’t believe in God: Believing is for the docile minds. You are Einstein! You can’t be putting your mind to such frivolities as God… You are a God. Believing in that is Jejunemehnn..
8. Use big words in your sentences: This particular rule has been working since ’05 days. You don’t want to sound cheap like other students. Make sure you slot strange-sounding words into your sentences. Hon. Patrick does not have two heads; make sure you give them thepolitical crinkum-crankum,higi hagaandsupercalifragilisticexpialidociousof the English vocab.
9. Don’t post memes: It will be silly and jobless of you to post memes on social media. Be brutal, create twenty-five slides of politics in America and the Netherlands. Write in Latin and Hebrew, you don’t want to afford others the opportunity to know what you know. If not, what will make you special?
10. You’ve heard that the best part of the soup is at the base. This tenth recommendation will help you to be easily recognized as a Genius – –keep your hair. You don’t need to get a cut. It is a total waste of time. Allow it to be bushy, let it fill up your head. Sitting in a barbershop is a waste of time,      you can use those precious minutes to read more books.
This guide is made up
of ten points that will easily get you recognized as a genius; I know you are
nodding in affirmation — oh yes! I did a great job.

"‘Only cowards run from terrorists,’ says Nigeria’s minister of self-defence",https://punocracy.com/only-cowards-run-from-terrorists/,2021-02-18T09:41:11+01:00,"SOMEWHERE SAFE (The T.A. Report)― One of Nigeria’s lesser-known Federal Executive Cabinet members, the Minister of Self-Defence, has called on residents of communities ravaged by bandits to take their destinies into their own hands.
Making his first public appearance in years, General Babachir‘I-Once-Killed-A-Lion-With-My-Bare-Hands’Magaji, on Wednesday,regaledjournalists with stories of how he fought in the Nigerian Civil War with nothing but a table knife.
“Who is a bandit, or even Boko Haram, that we are now making a big deal out of?” he asked as the pressmen looked on in deep admiration.
“Back in my village, everyone from the toddlers to old people on deathbed were part of the community vigilante. No one was exempted. We fought wild animals, fought armed robbers, and even demons from the evil forest.”
“But today,” he continued, “everyone is waiting for the government to rescue them. If you did not know, only the living can be rescued by the government. It is your job to stay alive, then our soldiers can take it from there. The government will play its part by evacuating your village, burning it to the ground, and transporting you to a safe displacement camp.”
He urged all Nigerians to shun cowardice, stressing that it is one of the reasons the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme has been sustained.
“Change beings with you, and so does security.”
General Magaji, however, said he does not support the call for people to carry guns to defend themselves.
“Do you see Sunday Igboho holding guns? Yet he can single-handedly conquer Boko Haram fighters. Do you see Aisha Yesufu or Omoyele Sowore holding guns? Yet they confront armed men all the time. There are other means of protection, friends, and I will discuss with the education minister to make sure we soon include this in our basic curriculum,” he said.
“Even as the minister of self-defence and a retired general, I personally do not use guns and I have lived this long.”
After the press briefing, the minister swaggerly hopped into a black SUV and zoomed off — in the company of 10 other vehicles filled with at least three secret service operatives and soldiers each.

Guide to surviving as a child in an African home,https://punocracy.com/guide-to-surviving-as-a-child-in-an-african-home/,2021-02-18T08:46:57+01:00,"By: SHUTTI, Ridwanullah Olaitan
An African home can be likened to a den of lions. A hunter intending to carry out an expedition in a lion-ridden forest should be armed to the teeth with various hunting equipment like guns, bows and arrows, amongst others. This guide is therefore the gun with which a child born to African parents in an African home must arm himself or herself with to guarantee their survival. An African child needs to learn and know the following by heart: –
The first thing you need to know as a child “lucky” to be born to an African parent is thatAfrican parents are always right.They can do no wrong. Where an African parent is wronged, the errant child is expected to sincerely apologise for his bad behaviours. Where a child “feels” wronged by his African parents, he is also obligated to apologise for his mistakes, seek their forgiveness and promise to turn a new leaf.
You need to know that once you are born to African parents, you have no say in the decision-making process. Key issues affecting your life are subject to the verdicts of your parents. For instance, where as a student in SSS1, you have a keen interest in the arts and the humanities and have decided to follow your heart; if your parents should want you to go the sciences, you have no choice but to go to the sciences, regardless of whether or not you can cope. African parents, most especially the father, are the Supreme Lord whose words are the law that must be obeyed even if your feelings are trampled upon.Which feelings sef?May your feelings be damned!
Do not expect any display of affection from either of your parents. Hugs, kisses, pecks and all forms of “wanton” show of affections, either between your parents or between you and your parents, are signs of weakness. Only weaklings do that.Or do you want your father be regarded as a coward?
Picture yourself as a soldier residing in a barrack. During your “stay” in your parents’ house, you shall be subjected to a lot of rules, arbitrary or not, whether you consent to them or not. Your day shall start as early as 5:30 am. You will perform loads of house chores, prepare for school, go to school around 7 am, return by 4 pm. Know that there is no rest for you at all. Have a change of clothing and hurry up to meet your fellow “soldiers” at the evening coaching centre very close to your house, where you will be till 6:30 pm. Then you proceed to do your homework, after which you will read till 10 pm before you are allowed even a wink of sleep.
Now, you may wonder why all these are necessary.Your parents topped their classes in all the years of their stay at school,don’t you want to be like them? Also, you are not allowed to watch the TV or have a phone till you finish high school. Those are instruments of the devil and you are too young to be corrupted. Ignore the fact that your phones can be useful in your learning activities.
Except members of your immediate
family, the rest are witches and wizards. Their foods are forbidden for you, so
are cash and material gifts from them. In the event that you are cornered and
have no choice than to except gifts from them, make sure to give them to your
mother for effective and thorough cleansing and safe-keeping, as the case may
be.
You must note that oral language is not the only means of communication in an African home. This is perhaps the most important skill you need to arm yourself with as this is second only to the first skill mentioned above.You might need to learn the Morse code sef. Learn to understand the various body language and looks of your parents, looks most importantly. Take note that looks are contextual. What a look means in a particular situation may not necessarily be the same as what the look might mean in another instance. A look might mean “excuse us” in a particular instance and mean “sit down!” in another instance. The consequence of misinterpreting any of such looks or body language are damning. You need not be informed that African parents, especially the mother, are well-trained in the use of whips, iron spoons, ladles, belts, sticks, and many other instruments for effectively restoring an errant child to sanity. Resounding slaps on both cheeks, and on the occiput should not be ignored at all.
In the course of any quarrel between yourself and any of your parents, there is no fair hearing. You are to be seen and not heard. You must not at any time interrupt your parents at any level of the “trial.” You are not allowed to counter any of the issues raised. Even if a cockroach is described as a dragon, in your best interest you should keep mute. Know that no matter what, you can’t be right. You may think you are, but no! your brain is playing tricks on you. How can you be right?Do you want to be labelled a bad child?
Conclusively, you should know that everything your parents do are in your best interest and for your benefits alone. Hence, you must religiously obey them and strictly adhere to any instruction given to you.

How to think of Africa and Africans,https://punocracy.com/how-to-think-of-africa-and-africans/,2021-02-15T08:41:03+01:00,"By: Adedimeji Quayyim Abdul-Hafeez
God bless the good old Trump for stating the African continent as full of “shithole countries”. Yeah, we are shitholes and we should know that already. As an African, one of your best assets is knowing your level and knowing where you indeed belong. This goes to the very core of my argument on the ‘proper’ ways of thinking about global activities to avoid being labeled on the wrong side of the divide.
As an African, if you don’t know already,
the benchmark of global standards should always be the west. Looking for just
and fair democracies? The west has it (never mind cracks in their institutions
and racial segregations). Thinking of ways of how the world should progress in
the areas of science, arts and technology? The west is the best bet (hey, shut
that thought that African cultures, sciences and traditions are equally
viable). You have to know that the west holds the balance, for they are the
entitled creations amongst men.Rejoice, for within everything white lay
purity and enlightenment.
It must have sunk into your depths that Africans do not really have a story except for one told by the whites (which is, “we really do not have a story”). We were a race of savages residing in dense thick forests liberated by red faces who took our best men to build muscles on Western farmlands. We should be grateful for that: to men who brought us out from the black garden of Eden where we were shrouded in thick leaves and from our abodes in treetops; to ‘lights’ who reformed us under governments and discarded our customs, which are “barbaric and inhuman,” and made theirviced virtuesembody our ways of living (ignore all the arguments in Walter Rodney’sHow Europe Underdeveloped Africa, those red faces were our saviours); to men who sat in Berlin in 1885 to divide the continent, like a piece of cake, into borders and territories regardless of our ethnic relations under the insightful guidance and gaze of the Almighty. We must really be grateful, for we had no insight to do these all on our own.
The African in you must have indeed whispered to your senses that you have an history. That your forefathers conducted trades with Arabs and Berbers and that we had communities enlightened in the conduct of prosperity and development. That the Old Ghana, Mali, Songai, Oyo, Congo, Sudan, Fulani Empires reeled in riches and economic abundance. That your traditions and customs upheld justice and fairness and that held up societies in law and order. But no, as I said earlier, you have no story, nor history. (Discard all those arguments in Adekunle Ojelabi’sA Textbook of West African Historyor Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TED TalkThe Dangers of a Single Story; Africans have no rights to tell their stories because they are “Africans”.) You are a conglomerate of chaos: shrouded in ineptitude, in pain, in disorder. We are the jaded hands of diluted histories, harboring the oblivions of a utopic past. We are the citizens of hope, held forlorn to the course of “mis-tories”.
“The worst thing that colonialism did was to cloud our view of our past”― Barack Obama,Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.
African intellectuals should learn how to think and behave like their western superiors, for they are blessed with superior thought. All arguments twisted in long words to hide their mediocrity and bias, as long as they are presented in roundabout forms to make them look intellectual, as long they come from the west, are true. Daron Acemoglu & James A. Robinson’s arguments in their book,Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty, on failures of countries to take advantage of “critical junctures,” “small differences,” “breaking the mold,” or lingering in the “vicious circle” should be held to heart, like words of the divine gospel, even if they appear absurd and impartial. All that comes from the west, even from a rogue economist like in Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner’sFreakonomicsshould be believed, for in them lies salvation.
If you are to think about Africa, your
imageries must be shrouded in gloom. Like thinking of a weeping and massacred Mother
Afrika. Or of famine infested areas in Africa’s conflict zones. Or of
pot-bellied African leaders with poverty-ridden citizens. Or of African witches
and wizards flying on broomsticks in the night to perpetuate evil. These are
all what these global index reports show anyway. Your thinking must be steered
towards the fact that African countries need aid and borrowings (which they
can’t pay back) so that these rich “philanthropic” countries can find places to
sow their seeds of charity. Let all the happy sides of our traditions and way
of life stay in Africa (to keep us happy in all that we face). Portray not
Africa asWakandain your thoughts.
Think of Africa as an amalgamation of divides, not as a body of humanity’s blessed species. View the pureness of Africans on division of tribes: Hutu and Tutsi, Yoruba and Igbo, Hausa and Fulani, Madingo and Tucolor, Asante and Wolof; as a clash of cities like Gao and Timbuktu, Oyo and Dahomey, Sokoto and Borno, Abia and Onitsha; as a duel of dieties: Arochukwu and Ogun, Sango and the Asante Golden Stool. Do not mind that these divisions are fueled by the embers of western colonialism. View a light-skinned African as superior to a dark-skinned African (as though our humanity lies on superiority complexes). Think not of the absurdities embedded within these theories.Rejoice, for within everything white lay purity and enlightenment.
Think of Africa’s leaders as ambassadors of the Almighty Himself, fulfilling His wishes and unquestionable of the vices. View nationalists who fought for their country’s independence as divine life leaders, entitled to lead and bleed their nations till and to death. Think about Africa with glints of pessimism, paying no attention to the great potentials it holds and portends.

Five jobs that will make you an overnight millionaire in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/five-jobs-overnight-millionaire-nigeria/,2021-02-13T08:56:10+01:00,"There are at least 21 millionunemployedNigerians, with a 30.7% underemployment rate in a country of209 millionpeople. The circumstances of many Nigerians have put them in morally precarious situations, forcing many Nigerians to either become criminals or take whatever the country has to offer them; in most cases,nothing.
But all hope is not lost, as there are still many millionaires in Nigeria and you can be one of them. In 2019,Guardianreported that Nigeria had 29,500 millionaires (in USD), and these are jobs that can help you become one of them.
The Buhari Media Centre, BMC, is always recruiting pseudo-intellectual, hyper-idiotic, meticulously inaccurate citizens to help share the good news of the Buhari administration. The good thing is that you do not need a lifestyle change, and you can work remotely. To be part of the BMC staff, you need to be on social media at least 19 hours a day, know how to move information from WhatsApp groups to Twitter/Facebook, be very terrible at rewriting propaganda, and be ready to fight anyone who refuses to see the greatness of the Buhari/Osinbajo regime.
BMC staff typically earn from ₦5000 to ₦50,000 monthly, depending on if you are an admin or just a messenger. Although admin roles are highly competitive, mainly because of the government contract perks that come with them, we are sure you will excel and rise to the top of your career in no time.
A plethora of Nigerians swim through the constantly overfloodedhigi-hagathat is the ocean of tweets made by Segun Awosanya (Segalink), the originator and propagator of the socio-political movement that is known as the #EndSARS. Your role will be to manoeuvre through a tumultuous amount of appraisals and vituperations, to spot whom you believe holds enmity against the persona of Segalink, and mark them for perpetual blocking on the blue-birded platform known as Twitter.
While the remuneration for this role is enshrouded in utmost secrecy, it was to our befuddlement to learn that aides of Segalink have incredulous access to the Nigerian elite. It is a magnificent role if you are enthralled by the passion for exposure over ephemeral pecuniary benefits.
This is the most straightforward job
in the country at the moment. Requirements include; knowing how to quote bible
pages, recognising friends and allies of Femi-Fani Kayode, writing birthday
wishes and other salutations, knowing how to distinguish between
cross-carpeting and consultancy, and understanding there is no permanent enemy
in politics.
You will earn a couple of punches and kicks to the abdomen as FFK has a short fuse. Still, you will live in wealth and abundance, represent him at high-level gatherings, liaise with journalists to occasionally organise press conferences, and be bankrolled for the rest of your life.
Create a WhatsApp group, add five people to it and keep their money for them. Then encourage them (willingly) to invite other people and get a 5% commission. The commission will encourage other people to join. The more members you get, the easier it becomes to repay. Then create a name for the group; make it sophisticated, like “Eugene Investment Genetics,” and call yourself Chief Investor. You will become a multimillionaire between three to four investment cycles, depending on your investors’ wealth.

Being a Nigerian house agent—in six simple codes,https://punocracy.com/being-a-nigerian-house-agent-in-six-simple-codes/,2021-02-08T07:38:55+01:00,"By: J. ‘Dare Okafor
One of the most underestimated professions in Nigeria is being a house agent. Majority of you think all we do is just to rent a small shop close to the road, get a small rectangular blackboard, with a few chalk sticks, and touches of a small fine handwriting to scribble down imaginary houses. Come off itjare! You guys don’t rate us at all, which is quite unfortunate.   I mean, it requires a whole lot to be a house agent. In fact, the skill set is out of this world.
For the sake of humanity, and for the defence of this noble profession, I will give you just six simple codes that suggest how demanding it is to be one of us:
Yes ke! If you know you want to be thisholy holykind of person, don’t even think of being a part of us. How do you think we feed daily if we don’t lie to clients on the availability of good houses, even when there’s none? You got to jazz up, my man! If there are no houses, you have to sweet talk them into believing there are. In fact, tell them you got the exactspeckof house(s) that they need. In this kind of situation, you must never eat alone, if not, you will die alone. Call one or two colleagues, tell them you are bringing a client for them (having in mind your cut), and be humble enough to become the secondary agent. That way, everybody wins!
Ha! You want to be a house agent and you don’t have a sweet mouth? O.Y.O. is your case. You can never prosper in this noble profession if your tongue isn’t sweet.  No naw, it’s not a curse, it is what it is, bro. For you to be ahouseogelist, just like the Evangelist Paul in the scriptures. You must be able to convince your clients on why they must pay an inspection fee before you take them to a house – whether they would like it or not. If the rooms of the house are small, magnify them with your mouth. Tell them the rooms will get bigger as they live in it. If the toilets or bathroom is like a cubicle, tell them that’s the trend and, if it was any bigger, they might mistake it for a room. Sweet talk them into believing that the house rent is the cheapest they will ever get, even when it’s on the exorbitant side. This should be the best weapon in your arsenal; without it, you will be back from the battlefield, defeated.
You can’t have an aspiration to be a part us, if the soles of your feet are not ready to walk the breadth and length of the earth. After showing your client a particular property and they are not satisfied with it, always tell them about more that are close by that they would definitely love – even when they are three kilometres away. And how do you get there? By trekking! Even when your client has a car, tell them it’s not needed, because you already know all the shortcuts that will get you to the place faster. In fact, you don’t need to have a personal car as a house agent because you will never discover new houses (which is your primary function) by riding in your car; you do that by trekking! Medals are won in this profession by how soiled and dusty your feet are. The soles of your feet are your car; you maintain it by trekking more. You must never forget that!
Landlords are the gate pass you have to every house you take your clients to for inspection. Even when they do not need agents for their houses, you have to give them all the reasons why they need someone to serve as a middleman, if not, no food for you. See, without landlords, your tag as a house agent is as useless as a gun without a trigger. So, you must always be friendly to landlords as a potential house agent: always shine your teeth, smiling whenever you’re in their presence, always prostrate before them when greeting to show yourself as an agent with character, and learn to  use appraising words like “Mummy wa, don’t forget me oh,” “Daddy Daddy! Has that your stubborn tenant moved out?” Remember, you are a house agent because of them. Without their houses, you are just an agent of shield. So, worship them!
If a landlord tells you his house rent is N50,000 make sure you add 20% of that amount as your agent fee. When they tell you it’s too much, divide it and tell them a part of the 20% is for community fee. If you find yourself in the season where the demand for houses is very high, make sure you add 10% to the 20%, and when you’re asked, concoct ridiculous fees to cover it up. After all, once the demand is higher than the supply, the prices of goods have to go up. Don’t forget to sympathetically tell them that with all the money you’re collecting from them, only 5% is yours. Since you don’t work on a salary basis, this is the best avenue to make your money in this business. These codes I’m giving you don’t come cheap, but I wouldn’t charge you because I don’t want to be greedy.
CODE 6: YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO USE STYSLISHLY TECHNICAL WORDS LIKE:
Agreement and Commission; To Let; Total Package; Quarterly Payment; Security Bill; Nepa Bill; Caution Bill; Breathing Fee; Shitting Fee; Burglary Protection Fee; Inspection Fee; and Roofing Withholding Fee.
With these codes listed above, I hope I have been able to convert you into believing how noble this our profession is. Sincerely, I hope that you will consider being an agent; you can start where you are by getting a stick of chalk and a small blackboard.

Buharists surprisingly not exempted from govt’s harsh policies,https://punocracy.com/buharists-surprisingly-not-exempted-from-govts-harsh-policies/,2021-02-06T09:14:50+01:00,"774 (The T.A. Report)― Contrary to popular belief, the harsh policies of the Nigerian government will affect most people equally–including even self-righteous Buharists and other supporters of the country’s immortal ruler.
This was revealed on Saturday in a report published by the Nigerian Research Centre on Open Secrets (NiRCOS).
“It is shocking we know, but we are used to discovering things we totally did not expect,” said the centre’s head of research Divine Odurudu while addressing journalists.
“We found out, for instance, that when the Federal Government closed borders to neighbouring West African countries, Customs officials refused to let people cross with goods even if they had APC membership cards.”
“Who would have thought?” Odurudu asked, obviously still finding it hard to process the information.
He cited other examples too: Of ruling party members in Katsina, the president’s hometown, who coughed out millions of naira in ransom to kidnappers; of four-time voters for the General who could not access COVID-19 financial palliatives despite being overqualified and having Bubu’s picture on their Twitter profiles; of hardworking trolls getting sprayed with stray bullets while innocently heading to the Buhari Media Centre office closest to them.
“The evidence was overwhelming,” the NiRCOS boss said.
“Since the Central Bank of Nigeria placed a ban on cryptocurrency transactions yesterday, we have read the letter and other documents countless times to see whether there is an exception for Buharists because, as well all know, Bubu is loyal to his loyalists. News splash! No one is exempted, not even Ogundesi.”
The think tank’s report stated that rather than make them lose confidence in Bad Boy’s government, his failings and ridiculous policies have only solidified the allegiance of Buharists to the country’s supreme leader.
According to Odurudu: “Many do not admit things are way worse now and the few who do would mouth something silly like, ‘Yes, the economy is bad and the government is killing innocent people but these are necessary steps towards taking the country to the Next Level.'”
Caveat: Note that this piece is a fictional satire aimed purely at humour. The words above are nothing but products of a drunk writer’s imagination. We hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the results of anyone’s credulity or mischief. Do not take us seriously. We repeat; do not take us serious! … On second thought though, maybe you should do just that."
How to be a lecturer in Nigerian universities,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-lecturer-in-nigerian-universities/,2021-01-31T08:48:35+01:00,"By: Suchet Baba
Nigerian university lecturers are all mighty and powerful, they are like gods. This article is for the young budding, full of life academics about to be indoctrinated into the Nigerian academia. It is valuable information that you’ll need, to walk with pride in the hallways of professors, who by the way in Nigeria are mostly old and greying. This is so they can respect you and see you as one worthy of sitting with them at the table, one capable of keeping the culture alive.
Read this carefully and jot things down. The moment you’re inducted, you’ll need a strategy, and these are some of the things you can do. First, you need to reserve the highest grade for immortals, like Jesus, Allah, Sango, Amadioha, or any deity you worship. Mortals shouldn’t get an A. It can be only over your dead body. You didn’t get A’s in some courses during your time, what makes the students think they are better than you? If you do this, the students will fear you, and other lecturers will respect you.
Next, everyone has a style; lifestyle, fashion style, writing style etc. As a lecturer, it is important you have an outstanding style; style of lecture, style of setting exam questions and how they should be answered. It is also important that the students study your style as much as they’ll study for the course you teach, because if it is not your way, no other way should work. How dare they be experimental or innovative in the way they answer questions. So even if they answer the questions right, as long as it’s not the way you want, there’s no way they can pass. However, what you can do to help the few smart ones is to drop subtle hints; some of them will catch it.
The next tip I’ll give, some may consider it corrupt, but don’t mind them, this country was built on corruption, our leaders are corrupt but have gotten away with it, so why not you? Besides, this is even a norm in Nigerian universities; no one will look at you in an odd manner. It is crucial, especially since the palliatives called salary that the government gives you cannot be sufficient to take care of your needs. Think of your children and the fact that they need to have very fancy things. You’ll need the extra income, and you can milk this from your vast class of no less than a hundred students. All you have to do is sell photocopies of books – handouts if you may, for a fee. Now the trick is, you have to make it compulsory for them to buy if they want to pass the course. If you don’t, they have the vastness of the internet filled with a variety of resources. If you ever get reprimanded for this, tell them a monkey or snake was the one doing this corrupt practice, not you. They’ll believe. After all, we are very gullible in this country.
I’m about to burst your bubble with the upcoming tip. This one may disappoint you, but I’m only telling you to prepare you. Now you probably have dreams of being a professor before you clock 40. Truthfully, I have only seen this in movies. Brace yourself and calm your blood. I know you’re very brilliant and you have dreams solid as a brick wall. Unfortunately, the bad news is, this is Nigeria. Religion, tribe and nepotism determine how you move, so join the queue, your babas, egbons and uncles haven’t made professor yet. What makes you think you can just come and be one, because you think you’re smart? Patience is a virtue, they say, so calm down.
When you finally become a professor after the Nigerian education system has beaten you to a pulp and you’ve started greying and having wrinkles, the first thing you have to do is dump those new model cars. Go for a vintage one. Let the engine cough, puff and smoke till everyone knows you’re a professor and you’ve only just arrived. Those new models can’t earn you any respect.
This tip is for the ogas in the game. You can’t have your students seeing you all the time. When the semester begins, don’t show up. Why should you be in class when even the students haven’t fully resumed? Show up once or twice mid-semester, then come back like the boss that you are at the end, dump notes, schedule makeup classes and heap it all on them. This is the university; it’s not meant to be a party or a place to chill.
To cap it all, if you’re of the male sex, you have to prey on those pretty and vulnerable female students that aren’t academically sound. Some lecturers made it to the BBC some time ago for sexual harassment. I know it’s your dream to get featured on the BBC. This is one of the fastest ways to get on there. I’ll write a whole other article that will help you get fame for all the wrong reasons that get overlooked in Nigeria. There may be a few ridiculous tips, but you need that extra fame. Students need to sing your name; you need to live in their minds. So I know you’ll read it.
You really don’t need to thank me. What do I earn if I have wisdom but don’t share?

Street 101: Five lessons from the (Lagos) city,https://punocracy.com/street-101-five-lessons-from-the-lagos-city/,2021-01-28T08:12:50+01:00,"By:  Timileyin Precious
Thecitytag — in very few words — is a goldmine. It attracts fame and respect to any place that carries it. Well, naturally, there is a rush for golden things   — that’s a gold rush.  As it stands, however, many small places in Nigeria — not more than mere settlements — proudly identify as cities! This is quite ridiculous, but well,who no like better name?
The following are life lessons that my city has taught me. If your place doesn’t have these things, if you have no knowledge of them,duhhh,jokes on you, village person. Never ever say you are from the city.
LESSON 1: FITNESS NO BE GYM
In the city, you have to be fit to survive. But wait! How do you define fitness? Is it by having 12 packs like Arnold Schwarzenegger? Oh! You think it’s by running 1000 miles every morning on some fancy track? Nah, those are very wrong definitions.
In my city, fitness is defined by how fast you can run and grab a moving locomotive. It is by how smooth you can perform a James Bond when you want to get down from a Danfo. It is by how gracefully you can strike a Kylie Jenner at the entrance of a moving bus without falling to the ground.  Life is evolving; it has no place for slow people and weaklings. Such is a lesson from the city.
LESSON 2: WISDOM NO BE BY BOOK
This confirms the wisdom of the famous philosopher, Adamu Aristotle, when he said,“ENI MO WAY LO MO WE.” No dear, wisdom is not in your ability to read Shakespeare and analyze it. It is not by being a nerd too!
True city wisdom solely lies in your ability to scam (this is an old word; it is calledleveragingnow) people, especially the ones who throw caution to the wind. It is the ability to quickly see through when you are about to be a victim. You know, a wise man once sold fufu for 300 USD. Well, if that is not wisdom, then I don’t know what is. Life has no need for dull people, such is the wisdom of the city.
LESSON 3: THE VIOLENT SHALL TAKE IT BY FORCE
In the city, you are expected to be strong and always ready for action. Everyone is (or should be) a fighter. You have to be ready to defend your rights. Isn’t that the ideal of freedom, of democracy? is that not what we are trying to uphold? fighting your way through?
For instance, if a taxi (you do not call them this in cities by the way) driver does not give you your change on time, demand for your rights, curse him! If another car bumps you on his own lane, slap the diver! If you are on a queue, fight your way to the front! The way to ever achieving true freedom is by fighting. Therefore, a fighting spirit, we must all cultivate.
LESSON 4: YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE
My city has taught me that greatness
demands sacrifice. Do not be scared, you don’t need blood and rituals. You
sacrifice money! In the city, you (must) buy a bunch of bananas for a thousand
naira. A plate of food for 50,000 naira, a bottle of water for half that price.
It is one of the sacrifices for greatness. Great things are never cheap and only great men can live in great places. Don’t expect to eat Amala at the same amount those villagers do; don’t expect to spend like they spend. This is a price for greatness.
To succeed in life, you have to be different from the normal, you have to stand out, just like my city. If these lessons just provoked very deep thoughts in you,tule joor!Introspection is a thing of the past, a village thing. Learn from my city, be wild, be random, be cool.

How to make easy money by promising giveaways,https://punocracy.com/how-to-make-easy-money-by-promising-giveaways/,2021-01-20T07:32:02+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
We’re still in January, you shouldn’t be going round complaining of lack of money when your mates are busy taking advantage of many discontented and vulnerable Nigerians who believe in magic. Say miracle money. The thing is simple.
Create an Instagram account. Use a name that doesn’t exist. Make the brand name look real. Names like;
Kiddies hubb,
Pinnacle phones,
Raydrid mobile Etc.
The list of useless names is endless.
Furnish the profile/account with downloaded pictures of what you know you don’t sell. Do you think an average Nigerian will make any kind of verification on that? No, they won’t. Not after seeing all the pictures you posted.
Now, make a giveaway post. It’s a new year giveaway your company wants to do. It’s time you turned to the society. Good people. You’re indeed toeing the path of our benevolent government and leaders. You are showing appreciation for their patronage and it’s only God that’ll bless you.
In that giveaway post, tell them to write a business plan of the dream business they’d love to venture into with N250k, and that you’re giving the cash prize to two winners plus consolation prizes of seven iPhones (say iPhone 8) to seven people. Interesting, captivating and mouth-watering.
Wait and see businesses. Pure water business, groundnut business, recharge card business, hair dressing business, palm oil business, boutique and even supermarket business, etc. Forget about their intentions; think about yours.
After this, make a fake transactional details of you sending N250k to two winners. Post it on your wall. Oh, many will praise you. They are well-deserved praises. Some will feel unlucky.
And then send a congratulatory message to all the entrants for winning iPhone 8. Tell them your office is at Zamfara state or Abuja. I’m sure most of them should come from the south or East. If they complain about the distance, tell them they should never worry about that. Introduce to them delivery service and that it costs N2k or N3k only. Drop that account number. Never mind if the account name is carrying an individual’s name. It doesn’t matter. Not with the joy of winning an iPhone 8.
To those of you who have laid mat beside a new year giveaway post of iPhone 8 on social media — Instagram especially, I really commend your faith in the Nigerian God. Trust me he acknowledges your faith too. You know, as we all do, He rebukes every form of suffering for his children (Nigerians). He makes them wealthy through a giveaway post on social media. All you need do is pay a delivery fee of say N2k and boom, your iPhone all the way from the north is at your doorstep. Congratulations!

Local man with zero knowledge of vaccines speaks boldly about them,https://punocracy.com/local-man-with-zero-knowledge-of-vaccines-speaks-boldly-about-them/,2021-01-20T07:07:34+01:00,"SOMELOCALITY (The T.A. Report)― A local man, Orubebe Confucius, who knows absolutely nothing about microbes, infectious diseases, and how vaccines work has been seen multiple times speaking confidently about COVID-19 vaccination–often taking the pleasure to discourage others from taking it.
“How come there is no vaccine yet for malaria, cancer, headache, and low sperm count after all these years? This COVID-19 vaccine was just created to kill all of us because the world does not like our face and wants to take our rich land,” he said in one of many videos posted on his Facebook page.
Even though Local Man is a graduate of The Performing Arts and has since worked as a party photographer, he has at least watched one YouTube video, read three blogposts, and forwarded four WhatsApp broadcast messages (after seeing the word vaccine and many exclamation marks in the first paragraph) on the subject of vaccination. Naturally, he now considers himself an expert.
Confucius did not believe COVID-19 was real until he lost five of his close friends and relatives to the disease. The fifth time, he had to insist on seeing the test result and the lifeless body.
Now that thousands of people have been confirmed to have died after contracting the virus, he has no doubt that the vaccines have only been taken seriously by many developed countries because they want to kill Africans, take people’s freedoms, and establish a <<read in thick, scary voice>> New. World. Order.
Local Man’s most hated man is Bill Gates, who he is sure could only have become the world’s richest man for so long after conniving with the Devil himself. Gates, Local Man believes, must have a sinister ulterior motive for everything he does. He has just learnt of the new Forbes favourites, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, and has started to read up (WhatsApp broadcasts) about those two as well.
Local man does not watch television or read newspapers because “the media only shares a bunch of lies” and when he does, it is to know the facts he must desist from believing.
“How dare you ask me for proof?” he burst out during a phone conversation with The T.A. Report. “Haven’t you seen the video of the Man of God who said the vaccines are part of the world domination plan of the Chinese? Even a state governor has told people not to take it. Not to talk of Dr Arushka Babushka from India who wrote a lengthy article that was shared on WhatsApp after resigning from Pfizer.”
“I will rather die than take any stupid vaccine,” he insisted before abruptly ending the call.

For his fight for democracy, much that the US has become jealous of late, for how his administration earned so little but did so much, for being a believer in the rule of law except when national security is in question, for talking so little except when he is abroad, President Muhammadu Buhari distinguished himself last year.
With a resounding round of applause, give it up for the Public Servant of the Year, President Muhammadu Buhari.
Nigeria’s first woman, Aisha Buhari, did well for herself, too. Amidst travel bans, she did the unthinkable: she reportedly relocated to Dubai citing insecurity. Before that, she has been in and out of the country. How much have we missed her drama and her conspiracy theory about some cabals in the Aso Villa. Where are the cabals by way? We’ve not heard much of them in like an eon.
Were it not because she is “in the abroad,” the Panelists believe that Mrs Buhari would have made some revelations about the happenings in the other room. Her absence has earned her an award nonetheless. Take a bow, First Lady, yours is the Disaporan of the year.
In a pandemic, one would easily have stuck one’s neck out for a health minister to be the best performing minister, but no, there is another GOAT in the Buhari’s ministerial lineup.
The “Vee Eye (VI) boy,” a former senator, a two-term governor and Nigeria’s chief labour negotiator, Chris Ngige, had a go at the award. But he missed. The judges believe with his consistency on how it took almost a year to negotiate with ASUU, he’s poised to win the trophy soon.
Enter Godswill Akpabio, who showed rare patriotism byjettisoninghis senatorial ambition to serve Nigeria as its Niger Delta Minister. A good servant he is, one of the Judges wrote on her scoresheet.
He nicked the award for his infamous session at the National Assembly that gave rise to “off your mic, honourable minister,” where he dropped the bombshell that 60 per cent of NDDC projects are contracted to lawmakers, a position he once held himself. The Judges wondered how many projects he got when he was the Senate’s minority leader before became a political born again by joining the APC.
For his rare show of patriotism, and his heroics with the NDDC which has made millionaires out of some officials, who else deserves the Minister of the Year if not Godswill Obot Akpabio? The floor is yours, Honourable Minister.
There was a stiff opposition among governors to outwit themselves to win their category. The Governor of Blush and Bliss who has wept more than he has delivered, a doctor who once gave a doctored thought on the use of nose masks to curb the spread of COVID-19, had a strong shot at the award.
But Ben Ayade was edged. Not by Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, who spent aboutthree months out of the stateafter power failure made him fall off the staircase. Not by Mai Mala Buni who is more of the APC interim chairman than he is Yobe State Governor. Not those.
The award goes to Yahaya Bello, who has even been tipped to run for the Presidency. Yes, Nigeria’s Presidency. His acumen at ensuring Kogi is “COVID-19 free” by developing an app to detect coronavirus at a glimpse was praised. The Judges said they hope his ingenuity would help create a vaccine from Kogi under his leadership.
He fought battles and he died many times, but he always had a way to come back. Observers even named him the Political Cat with Nine Lives. In 2020, Adams Oshiomhole, although he lost one key battle, gave Nigerians a masterclass on Godfatherism and how to be fight a political war. Make welcome, Adams Oshiomhole, our Politician of Year.
Brother Shaggi, Taaooma, Mr Macaroni would never have believed anyone could have been more dramatic. Certainly, not Fugitive Maina, who has mastered the art of fainting, came close, but the man whose name is mouthful just as his antics are even more handful won it.
A doctor by profession who succeeded not in the theatre but in theatrics. He left many mouths agape as they gasped for breath, out of awe and disbelief, when, under the heat of a crowded room and questions at a corruption hearing on the NDDC which he headed, he fainted.
All manner of hands poked in his mouth could not resuscitate him. His one scene thriller has outlived 2020 as his face has become the poster boy for twitter memes. Over to you, Professor Kemebradikumo Daniel Pondei, to you is the Dramatist of the Year.
While the world wondered who ordered the infamous Lekki shooting, one man gave us something to chew by detecting a camera which was believed to hold the missing jigsaw to the Lekki puzzle. Agent Fash some call him. Babatunde Fashola beat all odds to win the Detective of the Year, shrugging off contests from Tukur Buratai and even General Taiwo.
He has fainted for like a dozen times even though he’s not been diagnosed with any known seizure. But he gets well when it is time to run, all in the bid to dodge justice. His pace would make even Kenyan marathon legend Eliud Kipchoge jealous.
Former pension boss, Abdulrasheed Maina, was not lucky enough in his last marathoning which took him to Niger Republic, where he was nabbed in December. His running heroics has earned him the Fugitive of the Year.
Each time Nigeria teeters on the brink of “brokeness,” its late dark-googled kleptocratic former strongman, Sani Abacha, comes to the rescue. Thanks to Abacha loot, how would Nigeria have wriggled its way through 2020, including for relooting by his protégés? Philanthropist of the Year, Abacha, it’s yours in the taking. Shall a representative step forward?
Honorary mentions go to presidential aide Femi Adesina and information minister Lai Muhammad. The Judges awarded a month Netflix subscription to both of them.
The former was advised to use the subscription to watch Designated Survivor and pay attention to the cast Seth Wright, while the latter was told to see Annalise Keating’s How to Get Away with Murder and pay attention to the character."
‘I hope they won’t notice.’ Cleric disguises normal events as prophecies,https://punocracy.com/i-hope-they-wont-notice-cleric-disguises-normal-events-as-prophecies/,2021-01-07T08:45:38+01:00,"WORLD RELIGIOUS CAPITAL (The T.A. Report)―  Local Nigerian pastor, Bishop E.A. “Ojuonitiwa” Joshua, has finally released a couple of prophecies for the infant year, 2021. Strangely, however, many of the events foretold are things with a 95 to 100 per cent chance of happening anyway.
“We certainly hope they won’t notice,” Ojuonitiwa (which translates to “God no go shame us”) confided in our correspondent.
He is the founder of Nigeria’s biggest healing and motivational centre and has a reputation for giving vaguely spot-on “divine prophecies” — at least a third of the time, which is one of the best performances in the industry.
But, he says, 2020 was a disaster for many top players, including himself, because of the rude shock of the coronavirus pandemic, “so I have decided to play it safe this time.”
One of the clergyman’s best-kept secrets is hisStanding Committee on Predictions and Prophecies, with members who have advanced qualifications in Social Psychology, Political Strategy, Data Analysis, International Relations, and so on.
“Our leading prophecy was that some of the things that happened in 2020 will spill over into 2021,” he chuckled as he almost spilled his cup of tea.
“We also said that God will begin to deal with nations individually and heal those whose people are humble and prayerful — but, ahem, we all know Nigeria that has the world’s largest population of prayer warriors is still begging for vaccines,” he added, now laughing uncontrollably.
“God told us, you see, that the COVID-19 pandemic will become clearer this year, that the vaccines will work effectively, and that the year will be full of surprises. He told us Nigeria will continue to borrow money locally and internationally and that people should pray fervently to avert the death of someone at Aso Villa.”
Ojuonitiwa said all he has to do now is explain that the pre-handing-over chaos going on in the United States is part of those surprises God was trying to inform him of.
“I really should have been more specific with that because the signs were too glaring. It is what my children like to call a sure bet… I guess I need to get a new political analyst.”

In a statement released by his spokeman Imef Aniseda, the Nigerian Parosident was quoted as follows:
“We  have been monitoring the events unfolding in the White House in the  past hour, and we strongly condemn the overt attempts by President Trump  to subvert the will of the people and take democracy hostage in  America.
“The Nigerian government seeks to reiterate that it continues to support the American goal of a free, fair, transparent and  peaceful democratic process that reflect the will of the American  people.”
In related news, the Nigerian ministry of Foreign  Affairs in a travel advisory issued on its website has warned citizens of the country to reconsider traveling to the United States, particularly to the Washington DC area, due to post-election violence and the imminent fear of a break down in law and order.

A guide to becoming a quintessential Nigerian politician,https://punocracy.com/a-guide-to-becoming-a-quintessential-nigerian-politician/,2021-01-05T08:51:19+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
“Seek ye first the passion for Nigerian Politics, contest for a position (say Governor), do all it takes to win (kill, oppress, rig) and all other things shall be added unto you. Amen.”
To those of you who, out of what people say about Nigerian Politics, feel it is a dirty game, I really feel for you. Honestly, I wish your eyes and those of your fellow sceptics could be open to see what you’re missing. Was Daniel not a leader? A politician, I mean. Was he not a child of God? Was Joseph not a leader? How about David? I mean, you have a lot of lame excuses to make.
How then do people attribute the success of a Nigerian Politician to fraternity? The ideology and concept of most Nigerian Politicians being occultic needs to be eradicated. It needs to be washed away by the blood. It’s so misleading. Those who say a Politician must soil his or her hands before being successful in politics should be searched for, and dealt with (whether true or false). I wonder how people could be talking without proper verification.
Even if you get your hands soiled into whatever, what’s their concern? Will you come out to make a public announcement of what you are? Wouldn’t you coat it up with some religious slogans like “With God All Things Are Possible,” “Only God,” “Amazing Grace,” and then attend church activities every now and then like your tomorrow depends on it.
The process to being a successful Nigerian Politician may be long and tedious, but I tell you the benefits of being one are worth the stress in multiple folds.
— Become a staunch political activist:
This is a good way to begin this journey. Drag corrupt politicians. Preach politics on social media. Make noise everywhere. If people fail to recognize you, make sure they do. When you begin this movement, never support a party with umbrella or broom. This is to exhibit your neutrality. Forbid and forsake politics and politicians because they are all Satan’s incarnate. Politics is not your thing. You are only an activist.
— Accept an appointment:
After gaining popularity, you can begin by being a media aide or a legal adviser to any political party. Or better still, special adviser to the special adviser to the senior special adviser to the deputy governor on political matters. At this point, you’ll have to be supportive of the party and leaders you’re working for. Tear down anyone who talks against your leader. Be it on social media or physically. Ensure to defend your employers with your last blood. If need be, put blames on the past governments. Rain has fallen too much? Jonathan is the problem. Such a corrupt and clueless regime who stole the money meant for the rainmakers. Tueh! You can even distribute the blame till it gets to the sixth government before your tenure.
— Having chosen your object, broom or umbrella, begin making promises you know you will never redeem.
You will build 30 schools in two weeks. You will feed every child three times a day plus supper at night. Poverty shall suffer. With you, Boko Haram shall all vanish. With you, there shall be no abduction of any sort. With you, nepotism and bribery and all other forms of corruption shall die by fire. Amen! Shout change. Preach change.
— Congratulations! You have conquered. Our hero!
Weather you rigged the elections or not, you won. Thank God for all he did.
— Act humble
You can fake your humility by stepping down your car to buy roasted corn. Or by selling groundnut on the street. You can go for a professional tutorial on this from Dino. Sometimes, you just need to act like an average Nigerian. As if you love them. So you can garner more love from them — especially for your next campaign. But just keep looting their future away. They won’t know.
— Security
It is your right to be guarded by men on different colours of uniform and on suits till death. Your family and friends shall benefit from this right, too. Your security is important.
— Education
It depends on the position you’re vying for. If you’re aspiring for presidency, then its needless to think of too much going to school. Your Primary School Leaving Certificate is okay. You’ll have elites as subjects. You can even mock more than two million Nigerians by appointing a Professor as your running mate. As a Senator (of which you must begin by climbing the ladder as a Governor), then you can simply buy your papers abroad.
Of all these, don’t forget to be uttering a few lies on occasion, and having your cabinet filled with liars. It helps. In siphoning contracts and embezzling money. Why were you then a politician? Little lies. Who said in Nigerian Politics you have to sell your soul, your heart and brain to the devil? That’s a blatant lie. Even if it’s so, and so? Isn’t it your life to live? When you finally make it tomorrow, they’ll all raise faces of hope and rejoice for you.
NB.If you are not a boastful type who can always televise every little achievement (be it the groundnut you bought for your neighbour or any petty thing), then politics was never your thing. Withdraw. How can you not be able to preach of how you saved a life on your way to a meeting each time you want to deliver a speech? How you tarred the road that links to your village. What no man could do. Brag. Boast. Because what then will make you a quintessential Nigerian politician? What will you be remembered for?

National Amnesia and Allied Matters Bill 2020,https://punocracy.com/national-amnesia-and-allied-matters-bill-2020/,2020-12-27T09:35:32+01:00,"By: Abdurrahman Onifade
This National Amnesia and Allied Matters (NAAM)
Bill, like most bills that have passed through Nigeria’s legisla—thieve
process, seeks to prioritise frivolities, trivialise priorities and idolise
mediocrity.
This is a bill for an Act to institutionalise National
Amnesia, Official Corruption, Political Theatrics, and Insecurity in Nigeria.
The Bill, herein referred to as NAAM, sets to cater for the peculiar mess of
politicians and public officials, and also to stimulate and enhance pervasive
docility among the masses.
This Bill is sectioned into the following:
The National Amnesia Commission (NAC)
shall by this Bill be:
The National Agency on Political Theatrics and
Official Stupidity (NAPTOS) shall:
The National University of
Corruption(NUC)shall:
This Bill has become necessary to perpetuate government’s ineptitude and crassitude; especially on issues of governance that matter most. When passed, kidnapping of innocent citizens and students, and negotiating their release with huge sums that could be used for national development will be normalised.
Celebrating successive governments will also become a norm for their beautiful failures will become achievements. The citizens would have forgotten that if not for the failures of the former, the latter won’t have to be there.
Political criminals and their acolytes will be elected over and over again especially those who have stolen funds in the billions or living ostentatiously on pensioners’ money. The masses need not bother; they will be given palliatives during campaigns––which do magic, particularly if they boldly bear the faces our political looters. One can always rest assured that four plus four equals eight, or more.
Likewise, young legisla-thieve members who have engaged in domestic violence or public assault will be awarded as “Vanguards of DemoCrazy”. Nothing earns one such awards than being engaged in undemocratic acts in a country where National Amnesia is an attractive culture.

The many ways Nigerians are having a Merry Christmas in 2020,https://punocracy.com/the-many-ways-nigerians-are-having-a-merry-christmas-in-2020/,2020-12-25T09:53:08+01:00,"Jingle the bells, t’is the season to merry! Christmas
is here again! It is that famous season when we love to massacre cows,
exterminate goats and deplete the population of poultries.  It is the season where we live more than our
means for few days and duel with our creditors in the middle of January and
beyond.
This year’s celebration is one that Nigerians can
never forget. It promises to be the Christmas of all Christmases – thus
surpassing that most solemn night when the Son of the Most High took flesh and
became our friend and brother. 2020’s would be the merriest of this holy day.
Despite the troubles of 2020, this will be the first time in the history of the
country that every Nigerian will enjoy a truly merry Christmas.
This year’s food production has been the best in our
history and is second to no other country of the world. Our barns are not able
to contain the fruits of our farmers’ labours. Like that rich man in Jesus’
parable, our minds are set on how to demolish the old barns and build bigger
ones. In 2021, we don’t have to bother about farming, we will rather say to our
souls: we have acquired this much by our efforts and those of our leaders,
therefore our bodies should relax and make merry.
So great is our food production that we have to put
ourselves on the special diet of garri in the morning, afternoon and evening in
the southern divide of the country while our northern brethren are revelling in
the consumption oftuwo da miyan kukathrice a day. We have to settle
for small morsels of our special foods so we don’t offend God by allowing
gluttony have the better of us. The Nutrition and Dietetics section of our
hospitals have closed as cases of kwashiokor, beriberi and their likes have
ceased to exist due to the surplus of food we have in our barns and the quality
in which we ingest them.
Overzealous farmers who want to cultivate more than we
could ever need were mandated to get written approval from the government
before going to their farms. Failure to do so is a capital offence punishable
with slaughtering in the hands of the ranks and files of the lords of our most
beloved park, the Sambisa Forest. No Nigerian has offended that directive and
it is no surprise that Boko Haram is yet to mete out the punishment to anyone.
The matter of food aside, the road that leads home this yuletide is like never before. Gone are the days when Nigerians perish on their way home and instead of getting to their temporal homes on earth, they transit to the permanent home of humanity – below the soil. The road home is devoid of potholes, bumps and debris. It is like that proverbial broad road that leads to destruction but unlike that road its smoothness will lead you the loving arms of your loved ones.
Admittedly, there are times when our roads will take
you on an excursion into the arms of bandits and kidnappers who want tomake
small change on top your head. It is not bad in the sense that our economy
tends to grow when there is enough money changing hands not minding if the manner
of the money changing hands is legal or otherwise. My only fault with them is
the fact that they don’t write to seek and obtain one’s consent before
rerouting one’s journey.
It is beyond reproach that many of our compatriots
will have to settle for a Christmas in the hands of their abductors. Kidnappers
are not that mean. They are humans like me and you. I’m sure they will find a
way of organisingwan kain smol jolifikeshunfor their wards. Elvis
Presley, Richie Valens, Michael Jackson and Dagrin may be quickened to perform
some of their famous hits from their days on earth. They may even call CNN and
Channels to cover the event. There will be no need sparing a thought or two for
them. We all know that they will either emerge with stories to tell or precede
us to the place where there is peace and happiness in abundance. Either way, we
are no match for them experience wise.
Those in camps for Internally Displaced Persons shall
revel in the light and joy of Christmas. They will clad themselves in the rags
that more fortunate Nigerians can spare them instead of new ones gotten with
their hard earned Naira. For their meals, they have to trust only in God’s
providence like the sparrows of the sky that neither toil nor gather. Young
girls in the camps would perfect the bliss of the season for angry and
sex-starved men in uniform in an acceptable Clash of the Thighs.
Workers who are yet to get remunerated for their efforts especially at Local Government level won’t be left out of this year’s merriment. Jehovah Jireh, the God that provides shall provide for them according to his riches in glory. They shall possess the ability to command stones to transform to Agege bread and well water into fine red wine. In fact, it is the glory of the Lord that will clothe their children this Christmas all the while as those who are supposed to pay them, but have refused to, are running naked on the streets like mad people.
Prisoners should expect only divine visitation this
season. God has always been on the side of the oppressed, marginalised,
abandoned and neglected. God will not send Gabriel to their Nazareth this Yule,
God will visit them in the full majestic splendour of his Trinitarian
blessedness and bequeath to them the beatific blessing that surpasses every
other thing and human understanding. Who needs the government to cater for them
this season when God is willing to do more than the government could ever do?
Those that have been killed by Nigeria have cause to
merry this Christmas. Although they are not in this realm to share this
precious moment with us, nonetheless our customary display of joy in suffering
would give them joy too. And if we are not thankful and won’t praise God for
the pride and blessing of being Nigerian this Christmas, God will animate their
decomposed bodies to worship him.
2020 may have been a trying year for the whole world.
Not for Nigerians. We have everything working for our good. 2020 Christmas is a
truly merry one for Nigerians. May this be the first of many more to come."

Dear Mr. Ham Raba,
Thank
you so much for your letter. It got to us at the right time. I appreciate you
for seeing us fit for your next operation. Are you a surgeon, Sir? Because, I
don’t think there is anybody in need of an operation in this community.
In your letter, you said you are coming for us. See, I don’t get it. Are you coming to take us to a safe place? Like, a greener pasture kind of thing? Like, where Aisha Buhari went to?
Ohhh! I’m sorry, sir. I just got to read the letter again, now that my glasses are on. Seeehn, I’m scared already. I mean, I’m scared now that I’ve realized you are coming to rob me and my people.
Mr Ham, I know it hasn’t been easy for us, but choosing to rob us is an abuse to this community. What if I told you that you cannot find 30 thousand naira in our accounts?Ee shock you?Come to think of it, do you know how much they pay us as our salary? Before we feed our family, a lot has been spent. Do you know how much we spend on transport fare from here to there? Yesterday, I thought I could buy rice from Iya Temudo. I couldn’t buy o, because it passed my salary. I had to go to Emeka to do a Topsy on his garri to quench my hunger. For how long shall this continue? I know you won’t believe me but you have to.
Remember, during the lockdown, my people and I didn’t get anything. If not that my son had to loot hoarded palliatives from the warehouse he and some people found, we would have died of hunger. Probably, a skeleton would have read your letter instead.
Now, foodstuff has finished. If you come into our house with an empty stomach, you will take garri without sugar or take nothing like the stranger who enters a village at night. Nothing.
I’m still confused. Why this community, Mr. Ham? Of all places. Don’t you know places like Aso Rock, Central Bank of Nigeria etc, with high security men you can engage in a combat with? Why this small community? Better know your priorities and not waste your talent on local hunters.
See, last week, our president collected money from the World Bank. I’m not sure you got that information. How would you know when you don’t read the news? Another one, NCC Chairman has asked every Nigerian to register their SIM cards. Imagine, they are collecting twenty naira on millions of cards registered. Nothing is free in this country. Not even your life. Yea, you read that well.Even your life.Or you want to me to tell you don’t know how they treated youths that only demanded for their rights?
Instead
of you to have directed your constructive letter to the chairman of NCC, you
wasted grammar on a city that’s not even on the map of the world.
Maybe we can help you from the nothing we havesha. As the chairman of this community, I’ll ask everybody to contribute twenty naira for you — ha! It’s a big money to us o — so we can transport you to Abuja to start your profession properly.
Lastly,
when you start making money, Do not forget that we donated to your success.
Yours faithfully
Chairman, Shekpe community.

Angel Buhari at 78,https://punocracy.com/angel-buhari-at-78/,2020-12-17T08:13:01+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Mr. President, birthdays come once every 365 days and they present an opportunity to be thankful for a new age. Not just do we add a year to our age, we also move closer to our grave. Hence, the need to always think about what posterity will say when we are gone. In this regard, Mr. President, you’ve not done wrong. Posterity will surely be kind to you and your name will forever be on the lips of Nigerians. As you mark a new age today, I want to thank you for all the things you’ve done for me and especially this nation.
Baa Yusuf, you’re a record-breaker. From the outset, your love for Nigeria was unrivaled. It’s why you contested four times for the highest office in the land. And you’ve been doing excellently on the job. Ever since your angelic visitation cum intervention to Nigeria’s political scene, it has been heaven on earth. Integrity, character, and honor mean the same thing all over the world except in Nigeria because you redefined it, in words and action. Not a single guile has been found in you because you’ve over-delivered on all your campaign promises.
Baba, I like the way you service Nigeria, even if it’s with Chinese loans. All service na service. You have shown us firsthand, the various shades of poverty for our education. You, our leader in whom there is no cunningness, have taken us into three economic recessions in the last six years. A feat no one has ever achieved. Many who don’t understand you said you were too slow. They forgot that only a patient dog eats the fattest bone. And that after suffering is long-suffering.
Mr. President, there are distinct things only you can accomplish and you’ve never disappointed us in this regard. Everything your predecessor was voted out for you took it to the next level because you have the multiplier effect — a quality not popular in Nigerian leaders. Now, the dollar-naira rate has surged like garri Ijebu. Ghana cedi is more valuable than the naira. The refineries you promised are up and running. You’ve been lifting people out of poverty to a place of eternal rest. Under you, Nigeria is flowing with milk and honey. You shifted things and took the change to the next level. The people are groaning but it’s only because it’s hard for them to embrace change. They’ll thank you when you’re gone. Baba, you deserve all the honour on your 78th birthday.
For always putting us first, thank you. You showed this excellently in how you swiftly respond to the crimes of the Nigerian masses and how you always lead from the front in times of distress and national agony. This singular act has earned Nigerians respect across the world. You helped us thrive in our country so much that we export our best brains abroad because of the excess we have here.
Mr. Buhari, I can’t mention all that we’re grateful for on this occasion of your birthday. You’re extraordinary. And the things we currently see cannot be compared to what you still have in store for this nation. Left to me, I’ll vote you over again so that we all can abundantly reap and eat the fruits of our decisions to vote you twice.
Happy 78th birthday, God’s Angel sent to deliver Nigeria

I stand with Buari and his government,https://punocracy.com/i-stand-with-buari-and-his-government/,2020-12-16T09:08:19+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
Haba! This FG has really suffered in your hands o! If you’re not accusing them of Lekki shootings, then you’re accusing them of silence over Bornu rice farmers killings. Is it everything the Government will always be addressing? Must you always call them out on every occasion? Are they the only Government to be corrupt and at the same time disguise to be warring against corruption?
Imagine the National Assembly summoning the president of a big nation like Nigeria for questioning on security. What insolence! Is that not trying to ridicule his speaking ability? Is that not trying to confirm if he’s the rumoured Jubril? Is that not trying to call a General weak?
Three hundred and thirty three (333) male students have reportedly been abducted by the (in)famous Boko Haram (as confirmed by the Katsina state Governor) but the FG has come out to deny such a huge number, saying it was 10 and not 333 students. I believe the FG, most especially if our sincere Minister for Information is involved. One thing I’m so sure of is that, the Government does not lie. More so, based on the revelation they had, FG has further clarified that those involved in such incredulous act are bandits and not Boko Haram members. I believe. All these are Jonathan’s fault.
Please desist from any form of talks related to insecurity in this country. Simply because 333 students were kidnapped, I mean 10 students, doesn’t mean you should tag our country as insecure. Do you know the number of army men we have? Look, what happened was just because the FG (and its armed forces) out of fatigue had fallen asleep — you can’t cheat nature.
But I can assure you that the same way Dapchi and Chibok girls were rescued in the twinkle of an eye, these lovely boys won’t sleep under the custody of their abductors for a night. Shekau will be killed again. Maybe the sixth time.

Buari: Grand Condemner of the Federal Republic,https://punocracy.com/buari-grand-condemner-of-the-federal-republic/,2020-12-13T12:18:07+01:00,"In mid 2020, a remarkable Nigerian eulogised the incumbent head of the Nigerian Republic for his ability to suffer and survive so many life-threatening shocking experiences as the leader of a country that prides itself as the Giant of Africa. In thatvery-veryviral article, the writer pointed out the delight of Nigerians on how other countries are begging to learn something other than corruption, poverty, internet scam and the other wonderful things that we are renowned for.
Recent events have shown that beyond being able to survive countless electrocutions caused by happenings in the country, there is more to the man at the helms of the Nigerian State. The tested and trusted retired Army General is getting less credit than he deserves for his incredible ability to condemn incidences that are demarking the country and militating against the promises of a better Nigeria that he made to the masses prior to his election.
In January 2020, Buari reacted on Twitter to the killing of the CAN chairman of Adamawa State, Lawan Andimi thus: “This barbarism iscondemnable.” April 2020: “Bu[h]aricondemnskilling of 47 persons by bandits in Katsina”, reads the Guardian newspaper. In September, a news headline on the Premium Times reads: “Bu[h]aricondemnsattack on Zulum’s convoy, mourns victims”. Another Premium Times headline puts it this way, “Boko Haram: Bu[h]aricondemnsmurder of over 40 Borno farmers”. On December 12 2020, the Channels TV website published a news article on the recent attack and abduction of Secondary School students in the President’s Katsina State with the headline, “Bu[h]aricondemnsKatsina school attack”.
It is beyond reproach that there was a time when all he could do was to be in shock, clueless and dumb over happenings — all that is in the distant past now. He is now showing signs of being the man we voted into power with all our might and strength. He now condemns incidences without being coerced by the citizenry to do so.
His
condemnations are what Nigerians need at their lowest periods and darkest
moments. It is a biblical truth that the tongue possesses a very potent power.
It can set free and cast one into dungeon – ask defamers if you’re in doubt. It
can enthrone and dethrone – Trump can partly relate with this. It can make
Nigeria the jewel and true giant of Africa or send it down the rungs of
development and stability. Who knows? Perhaps it is with this sentiment in mind
that a compatriot composed the famous song, “Nigeria E Go Beta”.
No
doubt, Buari is in a position to change things and not merely condemn them. But
why spend time on tilling your soil when a tractor can do that adequately,
expeditiously and without expending a joule of energy? The sure-fire way to
make Nigeria better is to condemn the perceived ills and anomalies, sit back
and watch things change right in front of us. There is no man worthy of
condemning the wrongs than the righteous man from Daura.
His mere condemnation of corruption is stifling that ugly monster. At the moment, it is desperately gasping for breaths that are proving elusive. It may not take long for Pa Lie-Nus na Muhammadu-Buari to declare the death of corruption. It was his condemnation of the Boko Haram sect that caused its division and much celebrated technical defeat. Very reliable Intel reaching me has it that the sect is presently packing out of the country for a summer in the warmth of Chad and Niger.
I am not in doubt that his condemnation of the attack on a school and abduction of Katsina students will make their abductors to release them with the damages for the assault on their liberty lodged in their pockets. I wish he were around to condemn the kidnapping of the Chibok school girls; I have no doubt that they would have been back with us.
Christmas is here again and all I want for Christmas is for Buari to condemn economic hardship. I want him to denounce bad governance. The rising cost of living is becoming a menace; Baba should condemn it too. All that I need to enjoy a smooth ride on truly Nigerian roads to Kaduna this Yule is for it to be condemned by the president and angels will fill up the potholes. All that we need for our education, health, agriculture and tourism and hospitality sectors to thrive are words of condemnation by Aisha’s husband.
Having said all this, it is glaring that the president is doing Nigerians well. I therefore have no hesitation in hailing Gen. Mo Buari (Rtd) as the Grand Condemner of the Federal Republic – that which he condemns, and refuses to borrow sense and behave well, does not exist."
Our pupils shall never go barefooted,https://punocracy.com/our-pupils-shall-never-go-barefooted/,2020-12-09T08:06:36+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
I bring to you another good news! I’ve been so happy and glad since morning because of the news I received. This kind of news can give one orgasm. Trust me. You know how it feels when you finally come out to disgrace your scoffers with your action. Remember how people used to ridicule our government (be it state or federal) for ignoring or paying little attention to the education sector. Remember how they spent sleepless nights accusing Nigerian politicians of sending their kids and wards to schools abroad. These were all lies, I swear. You can’t be mocked forever.
Remember the news of a certain state government that distributed school sandals and uniforms worth twenty something million naira to pupils of primary schools? Maybe I’m late to hearing this but it doesn’t matter. I am fascinated by the pictures of those pupils. I see gratitude and excitement on the faces of these kids. It’s what their parents couldn’t offer.
In a bid to further express my euphoria on this, I shall highlight few impacts of the distributed sandals and maybe of the uniforms too.
These beautiful sandals, as you’ve seen on the photo, shall make the children learn fast. Sandals like this will enhance easy digestion of things taught by the teacher.
Punctuality. The speedometer installed in the sandals is second to none. It shall aid their speed to school.
Without these uniforms, those kids would be going to school naked.
The size and quality of the sandals. The government saw that distributing big-sized sandals (oversized) to those kids was a wise decision. So it could last them for about four to five years. No future expenses on what to wear to school.
On behalf of those kids, I say a bigthank you!Our pupils shall never go barefooted. Amen!

This might cause you some migraine: The Nigeria police force shared photoshopped pictures of arrested crime suspects on Tuesday. TheCable photo desk confirmed with the use of advanced technology that the pictures, which the police shared via its official handle, have been manipulated.
When asked why the trains (CDD5c2 2701 and CDD5c2 2702 models) were frequently breaking down only a few months after they were commissioned, the CRCC engineer said: “It’s hard to say, maybe bad luck because the trains were newly built and certified okay by our company in China before they were sent to Nigeria in January.”

Baba’s anti-corruption noise is no longer against flesh and blood,https://punocracy.com/babas-anti-corruption-noise-is-no-longer-against-flesh-and-blood/,2020-12-06T10:15:30+01:00,"Upon the assumption of the office of the President of the Federal Republic, Baba Buari did not hide his disdain for the hydra-headed monster known as corruption. He wasted no time in vowing to slaughter the monster and to bequeath to posterity a beautiful version of the beloved country where they will no longer suffer the many nightmares gingered by corruption.
His preoccupation with the elimination of corruption was so great that every question on any national issue was always answered with rhetoric on the evils of corruption and how it must be given attention above any and every other problem bedevilling the country. His noise about corruption was so great that it deafened two-thirds of the populace. I learnt it may take divine intervention for them to recover from their ear defect.
Not long into what is now known in some quarters as the General’s regime, the rate of sabbaticals to our Custodial Centres increased by 2015%. I need not say that those fortunate to embark on that special treat are those that have drunk from the chalice of power and were able to ward off its intoxicating influence. This charitable act of Baba did not start from yonder. Rather it started from his political camp even though we know that those who whored with corruption are in the other camp.It is kukuma true that judgement go start from the house of God. This has made many to believe that he is not out to witch-hunt a particular group but is determined to wipe out corruption not minding whose ox is gored by his courageous act.
Recently, die-hard Buarists have been alarmed by his uncharacteristic silence in respect of the issue of corruption. His disturbing silence has made many to wonder if the man they voted into power with their under-aged children, deceased relatives and cows, not minding the fact that queries were raised over his academic qualification, is still committed to rooting out corruption from the Nigerian DNA.
It is said that only a fool would repeatedly do a particular act and expect a different result. Baba Buari is no such man of low wit. In fact, he is the height of the best we can ever attain in life. It is only the fear of doing the sacrilegious and blasphemous that is preventing me from declaring that he is God incarnate in Nigerian flesh.
Having discovered that his approach to tackling corruption is not
yielding the expected results, there is no denying the fact that he was
shocked, greatly. That development made him to leave Hajiya alone in the cold
of the other room to work assiduously at the drawing board to figure out where
he may have made that slight and negligible mistake in the noise-making against
corruption.
It was at the drawing board that he discovered that his tactics were spot on but that he undermined the nature and capabilities of the foe. He thought he was fighting mere flesh and blood like PDP, Atikoo, Boko Haram, kidnappers and bandits. He was mistaken. The war has never been against flesh and blood but an alien foe from a remote part of the endless universe.
After consulting with members of his cabinet and his excellent and proactive service chiefs, it became imperative to face the corruption challenge spiritually. I learnt that sufficient money has been allocated in the 2021 budget to cater for the upkeep of the ministers of religion that will lift Nigeria to God in prayers. Also, the budget has made provision for the importation of rosaries, turare, praying mats, water from River Jordan, stones from Golgotha, mustard seeds and anointing oil. These sacred items shall serve as our weapons against the extra-terrestrial agents of darkness..
I most sincerely thank Buari for daring to change things when he discovered his previous approach was not working. This is something that was missing in the 16 years leadership of PDP. It is that negligence that has led us to where we are now and it will only take prayers and God to save us."

In support of the Hisbah ‘notofication letter’ to Cool FM on Black Friday,https://punocracy.com/in-support-of-the-hisbah-notofication-letter-to-cool-fm-on-black-friday/,2020-11-28T11:56:42+01:00,"By: Aliyu Dahiru Aliyu
Kano State Hisbah Board on November 26, 2020, sent a “notofication letter” to the “manger” of Cool FM to immediately stop promoting Black Friday on its station, which has already became popular for disturbing the physical and the psychological conditions of the good people of Kano State with western and alien music on a 24/7 basis.
We, the Kano intelligentsia, are strongly in support of the content of thenotoficationletter as we have already understood the Jewish plot to destroy the religious charisma of our great state. Don’t ask me how come e know; when were intellectuals like me ever wrong? We are the defenders of Islam so we know better than you do.
Cool FM has been at the forefront of destroying our culture and promoting drug abuse. There was a time I mistakenly tuned in to the station and listened to them playing a rap song by a white drug addict, American rapper, whose name I have forgotten his name … oh, he is called Wiz Khalifa. I have never seen his face but I believe he is racist and I am right.
Religious activists like me join hands with the haram police in courageously bulldozing the dilapidated buildings of anti-religious radio programs. I personally spearheaded the war against Arewa 24 and I won. I diverted the attentions of people from watching “Dadin Kowa” Hausa drama series to sending their hard-earned money to Sunnah TV.
I am currently preparing to snap at the heels of “Labarina”, a new drama series that’s currently gaining attention in northern Nigeria. I will include all the people watching the series in the list of semi-kafiris destroying Islam from within. This will give me a chance to stop people from being manipulated by the filthy television station.
I know some people brainwashed by the “Boko Aqida” propaganda may not understand me. I know few people like me achieve peak religious wokeness due to our God-given high level IQ. This is why I chose to be teller of truth and the slayer of western propagandists.
Back to the main issue. I strongly support criminalisation of Black Friday sales. I don’t have to Google what the day is about and why there is the annual slashing of the prices. My rare and extraordinary genius combined with teeming social media posts have made me draw a conclusion that it is an attempt to paint our holy day “black” and to divert the attention of Muslims from prayer.
Above all, no serious Islamic country will allow Black Friday sales in its shops. Even Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Turkey, Qatar, UAE, are all going to ban the day because everything black is considered unholy, profane and toxic.
I know you may say the “kiswah” on Ka’aba is black. I know and I don’t care. Black stone (hajarul aswad) is also black and sacred but who cares? Everything black is filthy; that’s why our schools migrated from using blackboards to whiteboards.
The “manger” of Cool FM should respond to the “notification” letter and not only stop promoting Black Friday but should also remove that “.us” at the end of the station’s website. Having “coolfm.us” as your website address while you are in Nigeria is like creating a state within a state. We will not tolerate it."
How to be a Nigerian creative,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-nigerian-creative/,2020-11-28T11:52:24+01:00,"By: Adedimeji Quayyim Abdul-Hafeez
I know that you want to keep your sanity, to thrive in this madhouse we call a country. I understand that you are desirous of change, and you want to contribute your quota to sensitization and enlightenment, albeit in your own little way. You do want to channel your intelligence and cognitive creativity to drive insightful discussions, convey unspoken emotions and contribute to issues around you. You want to shine into limelight, and you want to do so using your skill and craft.
I
am just kidding. If you want to be Nigerian creative,all these jabu no concern
you.
In your journey towards being a creative, and a Nigerian one at that, there are some rules you must follow, some paths you must tour. As usual, as the messenger of bliss that I am, I would convey these paths to you in bits, for your consumption and application. This is all in a bid to upskill your creative hustle and ensure you blow in the creative business.
As a creative, it is important to know the right platforms to market your creative hustle. First, the branding starts from you. Get yourself a pseudonym. Something likePen Lord, Ijoba Creative, Einstein Junior, Bolaji Writes, ©pen queen, Horpheyemhi, Soyinka-in-Chief, Young Achebe, Shakespeare Wordsor any other name that comes off the top of your head would do. Get your friends to call your new divinely inspired name. You can get it customized on your shirts and books to make it stick faster.
Now,
it is time to shift your gospel to the social media. Flood everywhere. Post all
your works, even if unsolicited, to WhatsApp groups and DMs. Flood your status
updates with picture prompts and the works you have done. Join all those
WhatsApp groups where you meet people of your shared interests – creatives in
the hustle. Post your works on your Facebook feeds and groups. Let them know a
rising star has emerged. Write about how you walked to make people like
Shakespeare fly. Show them all!
As an upcoming creative, your appearance matters. You do not want people to assume you have not reached the peak in the intellectual ladder when, indeed, you have. Spot anafro, dreadlocks, dyed hairor to be more authentic,Dada. Get sewn Ankara tops with black trousers to match. Get a disjointed Palm footwear or a tattered shoe. You must show them the intellectual prowess you possess weighs you down and that all the problems in this world lie on your head and shoulders.
It is time to put your personality on the map. It is time to let them know you are the ultimate solution to Nigeria’s problem. Attend events and lobby to be introduced with your pseudonym. Lobby to present your works publicly in weddings, birthdays, burials, literary events or even in official meetings. Buy books you know you are not going to read (they have to know your library is packed, yunno). Show them that you convey bliss and that you have published works (which are on WhatsApp and Facebook, don’t they know?) This would go a long way in spreading your popularity and to gain the respect you truly deserve.
Don’t
thank me yet. The lamba still full for ground
As a creative, all those people that are not up to your pedestal would antagonize you and try to rubbish your efforts. You must ensure their efforts amount to nothing. Tell them that you are not the nuisance they think you are. You would get depressed and suffer illnesses too, but you have to man up for the public. Haters gonna hate, because they do not like the face of success. You have to tell them you are the intellectual savior they have been waiting for and that they need to come to the light.
As a creative, you have to remember you are Nigerian first. Complain about the inadequacies in the society and tell the public the lack of respect for creatives and intellectuals is making Nigeria get worse. Complain about how platforms reject the works you submit because you are from a different tribe or country, and not because you are not good enough. Complain about how the platforms you submit to (which must be paying platforms, of course), do not pay enough for your work or are systematically racist. You are the advocate of the masses and it is your life-long duty to project the voices in your head (that you think represent the plight of the the masses). You would savor the fame and money would trickle to your pockets from those who want to silence your divine voice.
Fela no do pass all these too.
To
boost your image, you have to get into controversies with your fellow
creatives. Complain to all on how a particular creative doesn’t get his
dictions right or how Achebe is greater than Soyinka. Diss fellow creatives
with counter opinions and works. Write about opinions that are far off the edge
to gain traffic and attention to your work. This drives attention to who you
are and the brand of intellectualism you stand for. You must be radical, yunno.
You have got them your worth, dear creative, and the way you speak must reflect that. You have to get Patrick Obahiagbon’s dictionary and learn the big great words. You have to write all your works in rhymes, so that people would like it. You have to memorize all the classical quotes you can lay your hands on, so that people would be forced to clap whenever you are speaking. You have to show that wisdom is brewed in your thoughts and you have to deliver it all to impress the market.
You suppose know say no be everything you go sabi, because you no bi God. But you cannot show this infallibility to the public. A creative that knows his onions does not admit to faults and weaknesses. You have to read the great works and plagiarize them.Nobody go know say na Tolstoy and Senghor get am. You have to do this with sense and on a low key because if you are caught and ridiculed, I would deny you, completely. You have to get sense in this endeavor you want to dabble in.
These commandments would guard and guide you in your creative hustle, and would attract fame and funds to your creative hustle if applied dutifully. I have fulfilled my part by conveying these to you, go forth and live the life as a successful Nigerian creative. Go forth and thrive!

Liturgies of good governance,https://punocracy.com/liturgies-of-good-governance/,2020-11-22T11:03:21+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
To thegadwho kills all our enemies for us and keeps our loved ones, we thank You. You know we don’t care if they have loved ones. We thank you for always killing them by fire and thunder even when they don’t die. We thank you for not letting our enemies catch us when we take what does not belong to us. For if we were caught they’d have called us thieves. Since they never caught us, we are not thieves. We are innocent.
I have been a beneficiary of this good governance since inception (2015) even as 88 percent of us — the maimed, the dead, hungry, hopeless — have been. This is why I wake up every morning to sing and praise for the light that came in form of a government — for how we made the best choice. I know of many, both old and young, who are singing this glorious songs on earth and in the grave.
I thank you for washing away every stain of corruption from our beloved nation. I am exceedingly glad. I thank you for our revered President. Our saviour and redeemer. I call him the Nigerian Messiah. He came and everything changed for good. Thank you for the peace we have enjoyed since he assumed power. He has really proven himself to be a wonderful father. We are blessed!
No politician with two or three bank accounts. It’s a new decree. Every politician must own one bank account which must be closely monitored by the President himself to avoid any form of siphoning that would later dent the godly image of the government. This is to say, the tenures of politicians owning up to 50 bank accounts with different names and billions of naira and dollars are over. The stories of awarded contracts siphoned is now of the past. These can only happen in an era of one who bears Mr. Integrity as a honorary name.
Posterity may not forgive me if I fail to include how our President had trained his battalion into capturing all Boko Haram members, seizing their ammunition and putting those who thought the FG was behind the recent bombings by the terrorist group into shame.
When he became the President (which of course was your will), with the army blood in him, he came with a Pastor as the vice. This is exactly the story of Pharaoh and Joseph. It takes the spirit, integrity, good conscience and wisdom to govern Nigeria, leading the country out of chaos and famine. We’ve experienced nothing less. We see how other nations are coming to us for food.
When zombies from outer space came shooting at our peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll gate, our Vice President who is a fearless pastor, a prayer warrior and a spiritual combatant, came interceding and intervening for us (spiritually and physically). That was how the zombies fled. We can never have a pastor as a vice president and live in fear.
The other day, a certain First Lady from a certain state, out of her benevolence, tender and compassionate heart had to move into streets and villages to share to every woman ten bags of sachet water. An empowerment scheme that got women of other places envious. A rare gesture. What other First Ladies couldn’t do for their women. We know how important this gesture means to the beneficiaries. They shall ever live to remember this act of kindness. An act that kept women alive. Water is life. Whether the women use the water commercially or at home for drinking, the First Lady of that state has given them life. This is the best empowerment. One of the campaign promises, redeemed. God bless her. Amen!
I thank you for the recovered loots the evil government of the past had looted trying to tie our belly down. It was never our portion to suffer. We shall never suffer!  We are now living on it. Example is Abacha’s. We are grateful for touching our President’s heart into sharing the money equally to every Nigerian citizen. I thank you for  making us the world’s leading example. This clearly signifies that you’re here with us. When the world tried to tag us corrupt, you stepped in and showed them how holy we are. You’ve always been there for us. I wouldn’t forget how you have changed our story of unemployment through our god-fearing leaders. Thank you,gad!
We thank you for always (through your mouthpiece) asking 20 people to run to the altar with their 1000 naira note to obtain their blessings. Even though we end up having more than 20 people. Even though you later reduce it to 500 naira and 200. Thank you for always alerting us to run to the altar on time lest the bank of blessings runs dry.
Having thanked you for all you’ve done for us, I beg for your unalloyed forgiveness. Forgive us for the days we spent blaming and accusing our innocent government for the things they never did — like money laundering and embezzlement, like nepotism, like bribery, like killings, like police extortion. On our knees we plead for our ignorance. It was those paid journalists we followed. They deceived us into thinking our government is the worst of all. It was also caused by hunger. But now I have come to know thatman shall not live by bread alone. Therefore, I have vowed to live by every promise made by our politicians.
I sincerely solicit your forgiveness. We know we aren’t worthy to be called your sons. If there is anyone worthy to be called your sons, it is the Nigerian Police, for it is written: “Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called your children.” May we make heaven with them.
May you visit anyone who’ll summon the courage to challenge the government or a spiritual leader on what he does whether good or bad. Bless those who’ll vulnerably speak well of the government. After all, freedom of speech was meant for appraisals and not criticism.
Lastly, please grant me the access and opportunity to travel abroad so I can preach of the wonders of Nigeria to our people in the diaspora and even to the whites. This is my earnest prayer. Amen! I want to leave.

Becoming a super striker: Nigerian version,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-super-striker-nigerian-version/,2020-11-18T08:11:06+01:00,"By: Kehinde Amusan
When you saw or read super striker, you probably thought of football forwards like Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo. No doubt, both are super strikers but not in the Nigerian context. Here, they are naive individuals with no or little striking experience.
There are several categories of a super striker, some of which, for clear reading and understanding, would be touched in the light of this guide.
The prominent ones are the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strikers. As a federal university teacher under the umbrella of ASUU, you must agree to go for the longest vacations on a yearly basis in Nigeria. At least, using nine months for long vacation and the other three months for academic business will improve the condition of service and revitalization of varsities.
The goal of quality education is no big deal, compared to becoming an ASUU super striker through long vacation from academic business. The more quality educational goals you can reach through striking, the more mentally revitalized you become as a teacher. To compensate Federal Government’s regular remuneration effort, research and write an academic paper on more ways to boycott academic business. Regular industrial action would be a good suggestion for that purpose. Demand things you know the Federal Government will decline to stall resumption from your long vacation.
The preeminent of the several categories of super strikers is the leadership striker. Interestingly, this category cuts across all social lives in Nigeria, starting with the least of the socialization agents – family – to the political life.
To become a super striker as the head of your family, begin by taking a long vacation, like a president, from your responsibilities. Seek personal care from foreign ladies, caring less about the woman at home. Close your financial borders, promote hardship at the expense of the people at home; while you ensure importing every item on your wish list is not a problem. Make hunger a nutritious daily food for everyone at home, while you feed yourself foreign delicacies. Neglect the relevance of education to your children’s future; after all, the few that desire and deserve quality education will not mind lavishing foreign currency. Ensure your daughters hawk, while your sons sit at home, learning the art of a super striker. How much goals you have met or scored depend on the count of those suggestions you have taken.
The long vacation you are fond of as a family head is a good threshold or reference to become a leading super striker in your work space, even as a political leader. It is true that charity begins at home. This means you already learnt the basics and advancing to other categories will not be a herculean task.
If you are a public high school teacher, whenever fatigue is telling you to rest, suggesting you give your lesson note to a student to fill in (it) for you, do not hesitate a bit. In fact, you need not attend classes to write or dictate note, your students are appropriate for such business. Also, you can sit in the staff room all day, attending your teaching responsibilities whenever you deem fit. Keep on striking, as a teacher, by summoning some students, during their long break or even lesson period, to pick beans, vegetables, peel melon and do other possible home chores for you in school.
If you are a public institution lecturer, take a long vacation from your teaching obligation, explaining it away using the mantra: “90% of all that students learn is outside the four walls of the classroom and 10% within those walls.” Such mentality would fill your opened monetary borders to money paid for the materials you sold for students to learn on their own, at home, without the lecturer’s insightful tutelage.
Another category of super striker is the varsity-student strikers. The basic quality you need to possess as a super striker in this category is the resilient spirit of unionism (aluta). This spirit is important to summon courage to firmly demand for immediate provision of educational ease and respect for student rights you were deprived of by the constituted authority.
In making your demands known, as student strikers, stage such protest as “No I.D Cards, No Exam; Power Outage and No Water Supply are Means to Failing Exams.” Such protests are most effective towards examination period, when you have been stressed mentally with academic rush. This will enable those that are common with exam sickness to rest and recover, while others that are healthy can as well tag along to mentally re-convalesce. In fact, you will even have more time to prepare for your exams, which will surely hit you immediately you resume school.
As a varsity student, staying at home for about a year or more will do you a lot of good rather than learning nothing about life in the classroom settings. Staying at home will provide you with more opportunities to experience the reality of life and of Nigeria. It is no news that problem-solving skills, required of a 21st century job seeker, are best learnt outside the four walls of the classroom. Such opportunity could fill your curriculum vitae with the skills and work experience needed to land you good jobs once you graduate. As a student, taking online courses at your convenience could temporarily substitute the physical classroom long hegemony. All this will not collapse quality education in Nigeria; it may only take a longer ride to becoming world class education."
Presidential address on #EndSARS protesters and hoodlums,https://punocracy.com/presidential-address-on-endsars-protesters-and-hoodlums/,2020-11-18T07:31:53+01:00,"ADDRESS BY THE GCFRN, MOUHAMMADEW BUUHAREE ON THE UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOUR OF #ENDSARS PROTESTERS AND HOODLUMS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
1. This government has always expressed its commitment to dialogue as a means of resolving our internal differences. We have demonstrated this by our individual and collective efforts, including holding consultations at all strata of our society.
2. You will recall that in spite of these overtures and good gestures by government, #EndSARS protesters fervently perpetuated acts which breached the laws of the land.
3. But the government in its magnanimity never gave it serious attention. The most recent action of declaring protests and continuously calling on the international community, inciting public insurrection and attempting to topple the government with the view to installing F.K. Abudu or Aisha Yesufu as President has led to government making series of arrests to protect our country.
4. The steps taken by the law enforcement agents are a legitimate exercise in the performance of their duties. Government does not and should not interfere in the court process.
5. We have come to a point when the situation can no longer be tolerated. It is in the overall national interests that these unpatriotic acts being perpetrated by the leadership of Feminist Co and Enough is Enough be dealt with decisively.
6. Accordingly, the leadership of all non-governmental organisations across the country that are not in line with our mandate are hereby dissolved.
7. This action is with immediate effect. Administrators will be appointed immediately to oversee the affairs of all NGOs that do not support our national plans.
Signed:Fem Adesinner, Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the Parosident of the Federal Republic of Nigaria.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SPEECH IS NOT COPIED FROM ABACHA."
FG’s clampdown on terrorism: #EndSARS promoters latest to be proscribed,https://punocracy.com/fgs-clampdown-on-terrorism-endsars-promoters-latest-to-be-proscribed/,2020-11-16T07:51:00+01:00,"By: Machiavelli Miga
The newly formed military wing of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has followed the footsteps of it’s administrative counterparts in the fight against terrorism in the country. Recall that the bank accounts of at least 20 #EndSARS Promoters were frozen on orders of the apex bank. The military wing of CBN, it’s administrative branch in cahoots with the Federal Government, after thorough painstaking investigation have unanimously agreed to proscribe #EndSARS Promoters as terrorists.
Here is an exclusive interview with our
correspondent, Sapphire-erudite with the governor of the apex bank, Mr. Godween
Emere Faillè:
Sapphire-erudite: What is this rumours
about #EndSARS Promoters being tagged as terrorists?
Emere Faillè: Oh it’s not a rumour, alright. It’s a fact. Terrorists under the guise of #EndSARS protesters purportedly carried out heinous crimes bothering on treason that could greatly destabilize the good governance Nigerians are enjoying for the first time ever since independence by this ever-listening government.
Sapphire-erudite: Hold on, since independence? But this same man was the military head in the 80s; are you saying he was inept then?
Emere Faillè: No. On the contrary, he was the best of the lot. It’s just that as you and I both know, that military government will always have its drawbacks the way it’s structured and it was an unfortunate scenario the General found himself.
Sapphire-erudite: Back to the #EndSARS
Promoters. Their accounts were first frozen?
Emere Faillè: Yes. Like I said, after some painstaking investigation, we found out that about 20 of them opened their accounts and were receiving suspicious amounts of monies from donors in and outside the country in the name of providing food and other logistics for a protest, a common protest…
Sapphire-erudite: …not to cut you short, sir, but what about alleged Boko Haram financiers caught in the United Arab Emirates who had Nigerian accounts, why were the accounts not traced and frozen?
Emere Faillè: It is rude of you my child to cut an elder short while talking. Be that as it may, you know the Boko Haram sect are heavily sophisticated. #EndSARS protesters on the other hand are amateur terrorists we nipped in the bud before they could use these new funds to buy sophisticated guns, armory, and bombs. That’s why they started by burning police stations and maiming gallant officers of the force for no just cause.
Sapphire-erudite: But Sir, those were
hoodlums that took advantage of the peaceful protests.
Amere Faillè: That’s all fake news and what they want you
to believe. Believe me it’s the same miscreants.
Sapphire-erudite: The question about Boko Haram financiers caught in the UAE, you sort of did not buttress on that, sir?
Emere Faillè: Oh my dear child, I didn’t. In fact I was coming to that. You see, those caught in the UAE for allegedly funding Boko Haram… it is a question of diplomacy and international relations, that’s what is stalling investigations. We alongside the Federal Government are working round the clock to ensure stability in the policy. #EndSARS Promoters are the latest to be brought to book for attempting to terrorize the country with a protest.
Sapphire-erudite: Amazing, keep up the good
work.
Emere Faillè: Thank you.
The capabilities of the #EndSARS Promoters and their terrorists plan must really be a pain in the neck for the current CBN governor and to a large extent the federal government for him to keep meandering towards the newly proscribed #EndSARS Promoters each time questions are asked about the tracing of the funds for Boko Haram. A thing worse than Boko Haram is probably finally here and the government are getting jittery about it.
That said, the majority of Nigerians benefiting from the good governance of the day are at pains to understand why corporate bodies, Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) and so called well meaning Nigerians are vociferous in their condemnation of #EndSARS Promoters being tagged as potential terrorists and their bank accounts frozen. In a sane world, no one will want to be associated with terrorists, let alone be found defending them.
Machiavelli Reports will therefore praise to the high heavens the government for how well they dealt with the #EndSARS Promoters who are now terrorists. Politicians with over 60 bank accounts totaling billions of naira are not a direct threat to Nigeria. Nor are contracts awarded and siphoned by cronies any threat or worthy of it being tagged terrorism against the people’s commonwealth.
It is those who protest with dangerous cardboard papers, the Nigerian flag, and white t-shirts with terrorist inscriptions calling for an end to police brutality and their accomplices who fund the printing of these items of treason to the government and common man that are terrorists.  FG una well done o. Ya real father! 😡

Letter to a brother in the diaspora,https://punocracy.com/a-letter-to-a-brother-in-diaspora/,2020-11-14T07:57:02+01:00,"By: Aniebiet Effiong
With all sincerity I write this letter in reference to the note you sent which was all coated with fear and anxiety about the country. Let me begin by saying Nigeria is fine, we are all fine, hoping that you are also fine. To start with, nobody has died a casualty since the beginning of this year (except for those who were reportedly dead due to the coronavirus: if only it wasn’t the usual fake one).
We have lived in happiness, unity, and love. Our economy and infrastructure have developed in competition with the ones over there. If we outgrow America, put the praise on our politicians and our clergymen. Its their hard work. Elections are now free and fair. The police are now our friends. Crime rates have reduced beyond what we expected. Nigeria has become the safest place for investment. Please help relay this information to youroyibofriends over there.
Our politicians have once again promised to empower and support all the youth academically, financially, and even spiritually. Most especially during this pandemic period. They are men of great repute and integrity. They can never lie. They have done it before. They will do it again. We believe them. More so, Nigerian leaders are globally known to be promise-keeping, honest and, as a matter of fact, religious.
Before I forget, our own Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has been appointed Director General, World Trade Organization. What a huge feat! This is what our sincerity can do. It builds a good name for you.
To further clear your doubts and fears about Nigeria and the happenings and what people say to paint our government black, please keep reading this letter.
It’s a thing of pity when people start blaspheming the government on what they’ve not done. Those who accused our peace-making soldiers of shooting at people during the End SARS protests are agents of darkness. How can one say such a thing? Those were obviously photoshopped videos of some zombies from outer space attacking our peaceful protesters. These were all set up by the past government to tag our godly government bad people. They have been exposed. The truth is unveiling itself. As a matter of fact, no life was lost. Even the Governor of Lagos state can attest to this truth. He said this the day he went visiting those who sustained some minor injuries during the protest — say out of fatigue and the burning sun.
I know you must have in one medium or the other heard that about the alleged hoarding of the Covid-19 palliatives by top government officials. Please discard such a misleading allegation. How can a generous government like ours do such a mischievous act? That would be so nefarious. The reason for the delay in distribution of the palliatives could have been the End SARS protests, or that those goods were fake and poisonous to the health of Nigerians, or that they were so busy that it skipped their memory. I can beat my chest to assure you those items weren’t hoarded.
However, some people even go as far as asking for the achievements of these leaders during their reign. I laugh. Poverty is bad. I ask them: have you gone to Dubai and you’ve not seen their houses finely built? Isn’t that a huge achievement? Or what’s your definition of achievement? Do you think it’s easy to own properties abroad? These and many more are their achievements. Stop being sentimental. I know you nod your head when you see those properties owned by Nigerian politicians — your brothers. We are equally proud over here, despite the hunger.
How can one say that the President has damaged Nigeria’s unity more than Boko Haram? That is a fat lie borne out of pure hatred for the President. I beg the President to ignore all these talks and also forgive them. The President is a gentle and quiet man who knows nothing but peace. He is a man of few or no words. He’s been quiet over the series of bombings and killings in the country. He’s been quiet over ASUU strike. He’s been quiet over the End SARS protest (even when he came out to speak, he said one or two words and went his way). His silence doesn’t mean he’s weak. Asides from the fact that silence is bravery, sometimes he doesn’t even know all these happenings. I blame his aides for not informing him about these things on time.
The lawmakers are still working on the constitution to make sure there is provision for politicians to go for a third term. We love our President. May the Almighty bless him. May he win another term. Amen!
Sadly, the rate of Covid-19 infections has increased as a result of the so-called End SARS protest which was spearheaded by some internet fraudsters and hoodlums. But thank God the accounts of those who sponsored the movement have been frozen. A good one by the government! That’s a reward for protesting against good governance.
My dear brother in diaspora, I wish you could come down here to verify my words and also compare to the things you see on TV about Nigeria, so you could relate with my words and how true they are. But since it’s going to be a long process, I’d tell you to calm your nerves and relax your mind. I reiterate: put your eyes off those channels that try to make us look bad. All these are the handiwork of the devil and his cohorts to truncate the relentless efforts of our loyal Politicians.
Please ignore whatever they put up on social media. It’s to instigate strife and tension. But I know that the gad of our Daddy G.Os shall not allow them succeed. Amen! Having said these, sending us $5 wouldn’t be a bad idea at all. At least for this December. Please extend our kind regards to your family. Thanks.
From a happy brother.

"World Satire Day: Punocracy awards prize winners, holds webinar",https://punocracy.com/world-satire-day-punocracy-awards-prize-winners-holds-webinar/,2020-11-10T15:05:08+01:00,"Nigerian satirical platform,Punocracy, has held the second edition of its annual prize-giving ceremony forsatire writing. This took place in Ibadan on Monday.
The art group simultaneously celebrated the ‘World Day of Satire,’ through a webinar themedThe Relevance of Satire in Today’s World.
Themaiden editionof the award event was held last year when the World Satire Day, November 9, was declared by the group.
Punocracy first ran as a regular satirical column styled after Andy Borowitz’s ‘The Borowitz Report’ of The New Yorker at the University of Ibadan by a student under the pseudonym, Tubosun Ajanaku.
The platform had earlier announced thewinners of the prize, which was judged by Elnathan John, a Germany-based Nigerian author of satirical blockbuster,Be(com)ing Nigerian; and Chuma Nwokolo, a lawyer, publisher and author who wrote, among others,The Ghost of Sani Abacha.
The trio of  Oluwatimilehin Odueso, Favour Olajide, and Solomon Nzere emerged as top entrants in this year’s prize for satire competition organised by Punocracy.
Mr Odueso’sHow to raise a true believerwas adjudged the overall best entry by the judges, followed by Mr Olajide’sThe Next Nigerian Leader: A reality TV show, and Mr Nzere’sThe Gospelpreneur — Letter to David.
With support from Goethe Institut, the three winners were respectively awarded cash prizes of N70,000, N50,000, and N30,000, and Light Multifarious Bookstore complemented the awards with book prizes. Candidates in thehonourable mentions, Jummah Mujeeb and Fatimah Otukoya, each got a cash prize of N10,000 and certificate for their entries in the newly introduced visual art category.
Commenting on the entries, Mr John commended the entrants for their grasp of the use of wit, sarcasm, exaggeration and irony, which are key elements of satire, in telling their stories.
“Good satire not only ridicules our political failures or cultural foibles,” he said, “it is also a call to action. For satire to be this call to action, it must avoid things which may distract from this engagement.
“Satire can be subtle or brutal, and can use various styles, but it always has a serious concern. It cannot be flippant. Like a person wielding a weapon, every stroke must be deliberate or one risks harming the wrong person or harming oneself.”
Mr Nwokolo also noted that satire must reflect a distaste for certain societal norm, but first, its delivery must be one to make the public think.
Panellists at the webinar held on Monday included Victor Daniel, lawyer and features writer at Nigeria Abroad; and Andrew Unger, author of satirical novelOnce Removedand founder of Canadian satire website,The Daily Bonnet.
While delivering the welcome address, the group’s lead, ‘Kunle Adebajo, harped on the need for satire in the contemporary Nigerian society and the world.
He noted that the World Day of Satire and by extension the group’s goal was to make satire a widely accepted and understood tool for driving social change, correcting ills, and reducing political apathy, especially among the youth.
Mr Unger said humour can either be innate or learnt.
He added that either way, “it requires knowledge and literacy. It requires people to be taught to understand. It is different from slapstick.”
On the distinction between satire and false news, he explained that the intents behind both are not the same.
“Satirical news are never intended to trick people, but to get people thinking, talking and laughing. Not only are you making a point, you are also making people laugh.”
On his part, Mr Daniel said it was crucial to mainstream satire in order to drive a far-reaching awareness of the genre among the Nigerian public.
He said this was important for the public to wield the power to see the rot in the society and demand for sweeping reforms. This, he added, can only be achieved when the mainstream media helps raise awareness about the genre.
“Satire needs to go mainstream (in Nigeria). In America, people use comedy to expose the complexities in the society, from TV shows to entertainment. This will happen when media organisations are willing to give room for satire to thrive. We need more satirists to use social commentaries for the good of all.”
“Writers of satire in Nigeria are one of the best around the world, but bigger platforms need to elevate the genre,” he noted. “By this, it will trigger political consciousness in the average Nigerian.”"
Five lessons I picked from paintballing,https://punocracy.com/five-lessons-i-picked-from-paintball/,2020-11-07T08:55:21+01:00,"Paintball is a teamshooting sportin “which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical dye-filled gelatin capsules called paintballs that break upon impact”. You are learning how to kill people through a supposedly exciting team-sport with bullets that spray cute colours on the victim. Doeskilling with kindnesscome to mind yet?
Only three categories of people play paintball; intern armed robbers/assassins, peacekeepers, and prospective serial murderers. As a peacekeeping citizen, I went paintballing earlier this year and here are five things I learned:
If you are not on my team, you will die. I will shoot you so much you’ll get out of character and beg me to stop. I will strike you hard that your teammates will have two options, to either come out to rescue you and fall into an ambush or sacrifice you, so the whole team doesn’t go down with you. Remarkably, if you are going to a paintball, the chances of you getting hit by a stray bullet have astronomically increased. Either you get shot by me, by your teammate who is trying to escape an ambush, or by my teammates. But there is only one certainty; you will die.
If I am unable to breathe correctly for ten seconds, I run to WhatsApp and post a shot of Dr Strange telling Dormamu‘pain is an old friend’. But when a paintball bullet hit me, I forgot for about 76 seconds, how to feel anything. My arm went limp, and my gun dropped. Theatrically, gravity failed me, and my body followed. I was moving between two defence points when the bullet hit me. At that moment, I understood why the girl I emptied a magazine on kept on screaming after every shot hit her. You do not get used to this pain; you become helpless in the face of it. Avoid this pain by staying unborn.
Paintball hits you with hard lemons, and unless you are privileged to own a blender, you might be unable to make lemonades. Once the game starts, your priority should not be to avoid getting hit; it should be to ensure that you out-hit your opponent. I played for almost an hour and received only one direct shot. Why? Because my team outgunned (and killed) everyone on the other team. Also, because I was the General, giving instructions and watching the flanks right from the control room (there is no control room). I let my teammates go first; they draw the opponents out, then I kill them. Sometimes my teammates get hit, but we out-hit them. Yaay.
When we started putting on our gears, the other team (which outnumbered us) were excited. I could swear that most of them would be trigger-happy Policemen with the way they just wanted to start the game so they could maul us. I have been to several wars (Call Of Duty COUNTS!!!), and I know only smart people win battles. I strategised with my team, and we had a simple plan; send panic to the other team and kill them like chickens. A team of sheep led by a lion is better than a team of lions led by a sheep. We were crafty, smarter, and used all our advantages. When the lady in my team dropped out, we set up her helmet to make it seem like she was crouching behind a barrel. It was a perfect distraction.
The first time I played paintball was the best paintball performance I had. Asides my team having a strategy, we also understood that it was acceptable to make mistakes, as long as you do not stay too long on the floor; that’s when trigger fingers bang your skin with pebbles. The first few bullets I shot went out with the wind like my virginity vows. They splayed around the arena like a herd of antelope avoiding a predator. By the time I figured out how to hit people on the neck and arm, my teammates were also in good shape. This has nothing to do with YOLO beyond the fact that if you do not know how to shoot correctly in paintball, bullets will badly hit you that you will not have the courage to go a second round. And the truth is, your team can win without you.
So there you have it; how to build your resume for a position with an Assassination firm. You are welcome."
“We grow by looting”: Replying a Nigerian in Diaspora,https://punocracy.com/we-grow-by-looting-replying-a-nigerian-in-diaspora/,2020-11-06T09:14:27+01:00,"1, Corruption Boulevard,Megalomania city,Looters Republic of Nigeria.1st October 2020.
Dear
friend,
As
always, it’s a pleasure reading from you. I trust you are doing well and that
my reply is reaching you in a good state of mind and body. Without further ado,
I shall proceed to respond to the query you raised over Nigeria’s approach to
its economic growth and stability in your most recent letter to me.
As I believe you know too well, there is not a one-fit-all approach to national economic growth and development. This is evidenced by the fact that many countries of the world have approached this extremely important issue through different and sometimes conflicting perspectives. In fact, economic thinkers, as humans tend to do, are divided on this issue and have therefore camped themselves into many schools of thought: Capitalists, Socialists, and those that are neither for one nor the other. New schools of thoughts are also emerging on a daily basis.
A reputable fellow in your country of residence informed me that it is premised on the belief that Uncle Sam (alias, USA) will grow faster economically and ward off the threat posed by Uncle Shina with a blondie in power that the electorate voted the business tycoon instead of a lady that isso-sofair and all shades of presidential. It is based on similar sentiment, I learnt, that Mama Charlie’s folks chose to exit a relationship they were in. Who needs a relationship when one’s better off single? Without further ado, I make bold to say that in Nigeria, our sure way to economic prosperity is by looting. I’m made to believe that in this regard, Nigeria is in a world of her own.
To
start with, one unwritten requirement for a political post is the candidate’s
dexterity in the superb act of looting. Nigerian politics is a race into the
banquet hall. In there, the biggest attraction is the much storied national
cake. One’s ability to loot it well and in a clever manner is considered first
before such strengths as: the Nigerian god one’s credo professes belief in, the
Nigerian ethnicity that your tribal marks associates you with, the political
party in whose jersey you are vying for a slot into the banquet hall and thedog-fathercheering you in thedog-raceto the banquet hall. It doesn’t matter if
your name starts with A (as in Abasha) or B (as in my nickname Bad-Boy Boohari),
to succeed in Nigerian politics, you must possess dexterity in looting – a
foolish man won’t be open about it though.
Back to the matter (and sorry for the small deviation), in Nigeria, we grow our economy by looting. I know on the surface it may appear preposterous, but please, allow me to explain before you reach a conclusion on the validity of my statement. Nigeria’s wealth is in a treasury that everyone can access if you know how. (If you don’t know how, you have no business being Nigerian.) If I loot a substantial part of the treasury, you loot what you can and others take what they can and even more; then we shall lack nothing. Save for those who belong to teamNa Me Holy Pass.
Our
new-found wealth has been able to build mansions in our villages. Though few,
but with our edifices dotting the Nigerian landscape like a sparse array of
stars in a dark cloud, it is and would always be a beauty to behold! From one
beautiful mansion, we would have another and yet another. Before you know it,
our houses would be everywhere. In the near future, we shall take our place of
pride as feudal lords over those who don’t know how to loot. For blessed are
those who loot, they shall inherit the land at the expense of those who are
meek.
In
addition to the aforesaid, the fruits of our loots would allow us to fly
private across the globe and compete favourably with the birds of the air. We
won’t have to sweat over medical tours beyond the shores of this country and as
you know too well we won’t need our local hospitals anymore as our bodies have
become too good for them. Our children will study at the best institutions
abroad and by so doing save them from poor tutors who may want to impart into
them dangerous ideologies like anarchy, egalitarianism, social justice,
socialism, feminism and other trash peddled around by poor minds who have read
a book or two.
At this point, you may have been wondering what has happened to my sense of compassion. Well, I have long given up on this country and only care aboutme, myself and I. Those that have killed themselves for this country, how many kobos do their children have to show for the patriotism and sacrifices of their parents? My friend, it is only a fool that will see fire burning the beards of his friend and not sprinkle his with water. I am more than determined to cater for myself and allow Nigeria take care of its well-being – after all, is Nigeria not an arbitrary creation of our British colonisers? I would be a fool to think I — or any other Nigerian in my economic class for that matter — can solve Nigeria’s problems.
I bear no grain of pity for those who are not in our position. They envy us and wish they were in our position. Given the opportunity, they will kill us and acquire what we have. What is preventing them is the law of the land that they regard as a creation of our elite class to subjugate and make them subservient to us in perpetuity. The recent wave of looting inspired by the “End SARS” protest is quite instructive in this regard. From looting what they felt we withheld from them, they went on to attack our assets and went away with what they can. The properties of others in their class were not spared either. At that point and as it has always been, their preoccupation is how to loot their way to wealth and prominence.
The good thing to have come out from our spree of looting is that things that we would have catered for have suddenly become self-reliant. Our economy, like that famous debtor of Things Fall Apart, is now perfect at borrowing money it cannot pay and does not intend to pay. Aside from the Nigerian economy, I do not know of any other that can borrow, refuse to offset its debt and still go ahead to impose economic sanctions on its lender. When it is not borrowing and feels like playing Jesus the feet-washer, it resorts to begging. Our lenders abroad have mastered the lyrics of our famous begging rhyme:Babiala/ Akoba adaba, Olo’un m’ajen ri. Our hospitals cater for themselves. They only heal those they can and hasten the death of those they cannot. Our roads have acquired auto-repair ability for their own upkeep and maintenance. Where it is impracticable for them to do so; they revert to the forest that they once were at the dawn of creation.
In your letter, you notified me of the displeasure of our counterparts over there at what they perceive as our “pitiable plight”. To them I like to say; Weep not for us. Weep not for our future. Do not lose sleep over our predicaments. We ain’t complaining! Rather let them weep for themselves: they who no longer frequent church and mosques; they who marry people of the same sex and allow people to change their gender; they who allow women to rule over them when God has made them head over women; they who dress naked.
I
most sincerely thank you for always writing and sharing your thoughts on
issues, especially as they affect Nigeria. It is evident that you may have been
out of Nigeria but Nigeria has not gone out of you. Please extend my regards to
your large family of Nigerians in Diaspora.
Thank
you.

The law-abiding CCTV camera,https://punocracy.com/the-law-abiding-cctv-camera/,2020-11-06T08:28:18+01:00,"By: Hurricane Dave
As the dust raised by the #EndSARS rampagers gradually settles, committees are being set up across the country to look into the claims of the “protesters” and find the best way to move the country from the chaos of the hoodlums. One of such committees that has been making so much headway is the Panel of Inquiry and Restitution set up by the Lagos state government to look into the allegations of police brutality and highhandedness by personnel of the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).
At the fourth sitting of the this panel, the managing director of the Lekki Concession Company, Mr Abayomi Omomuwansa, submitted the video footage recorded by the company’s surveillance camera on the night of October 20, when soldiers allegedly opened fire on unarmed #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki tollgate area in Lagos.
While making the submission, Mr Omomuwansa noted that their CCTV cameras stopped recording at 8 pm that fateful night due to network issue. This seems to be the official stand of LCC. However, according to insider reports, the CCTV cameras suddenly stopped working at 8 pm in observance of the curfew imposed by the government. He said, “Our cameras at the Lekki toll gate have a high sense of moral duty which includes obeying the laws of the land. It is not unprecedented that the cameras refused to work on the night of the curfew. How do you truly give your all for a country if you don’t obey all her rules?”
The panel has promised to get to the root of what happened at Lekki on the said day. They plan on doing this by listening to the statements of our politicians and top army officials, who are men of great integrity and will never lie.
However, the CCTV camera has awakened a lot of reactions in Nigeria, most of them positive ones. According to one of our source who choose to be anonymous, “Majority of the citizens of the country are really happy and in support of the actions of the law-abiding CCTV. It is a globally acknowledged fact that Nigerians are honest and law-abiding. It is now a thing of joy to see that our gadgets have imbibed our law abiding characteristics. That’s not a surprise anyway. Garbage in, garbage out.”
Another source; this time around, a highly-revered clergyman who also prefers to be anonymous (to avoid being brutalised by the #EndSARS hoodlums who have decided to declare war on the country with their hashtags against police brutality and nationwide prayer walks) said, “It is a time of great joy for our country and the body of Christ in the country. The incident is a testament to the practical application of our preaching in our lives.”
“We are assured that the CCTV camera is born again and, hence, shuns every act of disobedience. It is our hope that the #EndSARS hoodlums and other CCTV cameras across the country and the world at large will take a step in the right direction and follow the lead of the law-abiding CCTV. At this point, all eyes are on us,” the clergyman added.
We are keeping a close eye on the developments from that panel and hope to see more positive outcomes like this. As it stands, though, it is obvious that Nigeria is a country of obedient citizens. This image is quite vital as the world now places so much value on honesty and obedience.

End SARS campaign and its many dramatic interludes,https://punocracy.com/end-sars-campaign-and-its-many-dramatic-interludes/,2020-11-04T09:43:17+01:00,"By: Abayomi Ogundele
His Lordship, Honourable Samuel Tajudeen Pedro, swerved out of the Temple of Justice majestically having delivered a landmark judgement in the case ofBlue Birds v Super Eagles (2020) CHARGE NO: ENDSARS/L/HC/56/20. He went out of the courtroom fully robed, neglecting the Rules of Professional Conduct. The incarnate Lady Justicia held in his right hand the cutlass of truth and some files which obviously contained his sound reasoning.
His honour was definitely very humble. His path was the same route the beneficiary of the judgement pointed. His modesty was worth appraising. He jettisoned his official Pedro or Pathfinders jeep and was quite content with his leggediz Benzes. He had this peace of mind other judges did not have. He moved about freely without fear of harm. The execution of his judgement took an immediate course. Immediately after his pronouncement, justice was executed without the aid of the sheriff, bailiff or law enforcement agencies. The proceeds of the judgement were a standing fan, an air conditioner, one LG flat screen television, a printer and some computers. The parties in whose favour the judgement was given came out rejoicing with the dividends of justice. The judgement was a conclusive one – there cannot be transfer of records to the appellate court.
Immediately His Lordship left the temple of justice, the whole building was razed down. The oldest court in Nigeria, our colonial heritage, clothed in ashes. The probate session was also touched; I guess the dead who discovered they made mistakes when sharing their property came back to correct them. Now watch out for the tragedy of justice, if by tomorrow, His Lordship, Honourable Justice Samuel Tajudeen Pedro is finally arraigned before his learned brother who has been subjected to series ofdenovo, lost several judgements prepared but yet pronounced, and books for research as well as other valuables as a result of his learned brother’s judgement. Hon. Pedro’s ultimate prayer would be that he should not be charged under a section without a limit to sentence. Hon. Pedro might have to prove his innocence without initial conviction.
“DPO, DPO, DPO!” was the chant on the lips of his family members. Godwin Ismaila was collectively saluted by the Police officers and other well-wishers. Growing up, he had wanted to be a policeman with a reformed mind to turn things around. However at age 15, he dropped out of Ogbanje Secondary School, Bariga when he was just in SS1 after he lost his parents in a civil unrest at Alagbon Bariga, Lagos. He was integrated into a new family, a new home when the government failed to absorb him into the social security system. Now posterity has smiled on him.
Yesterday, he was employed by the Nigerian Police Force not as a Sergeant or Corporal but as a Divisional Police Officer. He had not been given his complete outfit but he got a shirt on which the name, ‘Samuel Lawrence’ (I think another Sizwe Banzi will have to die) was inscribed. Ismaila James is now the DPO of Area K. No more Godwin Ismaila but DPO. If you see him and his boys on patrol, don’t make the mistake of reading out his name from his shirt; just respect him. His command of English language should not define him, he is the DPO meant to protect us for now. Unless the Nigerian Police Force change their outfit, we will battle with this nightmare during pure daylight awake.
‘Kini oba’ was also kidnapped; I learnt the Oluawo has invoked the spirit of death to strike Taofeek Ikorodu who was seen running with the staff and the shoes. Fortunately, alongside thekini oba, palliatives were also discovered. The king must have taken hint from Egypt’s history to gather food for the remainder of 2020. This is love misconstrued by his subjects. He must have done that knowing that 2020 is full of surprises. Thekini obawas used to cook the palliatives which was served at the Oluawo’s birthday. Yet, we were informed the person who took thekini obais dead. The staff was so powerful, it did not kill when pilfered till a while after, particularly when a service incantation was conducted via the media to all its subjects.
In fact, we learnt that there was a procession of virgins clothed in pure white parading the ‘latitude 46 to longitude 40’ along the palace axis. The lady who led the walk looks like Aliah Ruth, that tall light in complexion lady who sellsparagaat Mushin. All this were in bit to further calcify the return and resurrection ofkini obawhich is now more powdered than ashes.
There was also a bank discovered in the palace. It was a mini-bank containing dollars. The Oba was not actually the owner, his cousin who builds caskets and was a part-time Bureau de change businessman is the actual owner of the box and its contents. Shortly after the discovery, there was a pool party. This was the biggest dream of Yusuf and Daniel, who all through their life had played in the flood coming from Orile. They swam in the pool and had the time of their lives. Sola was not at the pool but Rasheed sent Bola to call him, it was to be an enjoyable experience.
Adamu also threatened the blue bird and its owner, Jack, that his dog will catch and eat them raw. Well, quite impossible right? You know, the Supreme Court, has power to empower. Even in Jos, there were more hungry people than the total population, after the palliatives hideout was discovered by Alhaji Fash Agent. The good people of Jos were amazing and kind people, they only took the palliatives and left the land. The state of harmony was almost disharmonised, actually the devil should be blamed. After the discovery of their own palliatives ware-house, Lucifer took the complexion of a shopping mall and other companies. He completely seduced the innocent people.
Get the gist, The Nigeria Police Force has just traded its prowess, there shall be more miscreants parading themselves in police uniform, we shall also be exposed to serious armed threat and robbery. Subsequent suspects would not be innocent in the mind of manyjudexand the traditional stool has now been defiled. Many rich people might have to live in fear, at least for now.
Maybe if Nigerian Police force changes their uniform, maybe if there are house-to-house searches for people who ought to be suspected to have hoarded ammunition taken from the Nigerian Police force arsenal, and maybe if the stool is totally separated from politics. Maybe if there can be transparency in the system, maybe if more youth are allowed to have a say in policy-making, maybe if the National Assembly and Houses of Assembly are placed on civil servant payroll. Maybe we shall be able to undo the dos of the massacre. Maybe. Except for the lives lost."
Nigerian gets kidnapped abroad. Nigerians react on behalf of govt.,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-gets-kidnapped-abroad-nigerians-react-on-behalf-of-govt/,2020-11-02T06:47:29+01:00,"TWITTER (The T.A. Report)― From setting up a committee to blaming the victim for being reckless, Nigerians have predicted with hilariously sorrowful accuracy how their government would likely react to one of the country’s citizens getting abducted by criminals in a foreign country, say Libya.
Special forces of the United States had recently rescued an American national, 27-year-old Philip Walton, who had been kidnapped in Niger and brought to Nigeria.
“The United States is committed to the safe return of all US citizens taken captive. We delivered on that commitment late last night in Nigeria … We will never abandon any American taken hostage,” said US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.
Understandably, Nigerians, on whose soil the daring operation took place, read this press statement with their jaws reaching for the ground as many had thought such scenes were only enacted by Hollywood actors. According to Temitope Ajiriya, an expert on Abusive Relationships, Nigerians treat patriotism the same way religious faithful treat the love of God — “you should expect and demand nothing in return”.
Jack, a prominent Nigerian Twitter user who calls himself aPreceptor, Observer, Beholder and Chronicler of Mysteries Not Easily Explainable or Known To Men, was determined not to wallow in sadness alone and, on Saturday, engaged other Nigerians in a meditative exercise of self-pity.
“Real Story: US citizen kidnapped in Niger Republic.. US sends NAVY SEAL to rescue him. Imagine a Nigerian citizen kidnapped in Libya…. Reply as the Nigerian Government,” hetweeted.
Here are some of the responses to Jack’s tweet:

Hypocrisy’s new book about Nigeria becomes a best-seller,https://punocracy.com/hypocrisys-new-book-about-nigeria-becomes-a-best-seller/,2020-11-02T06:47:10+01:00,"Hypocrisy’s new book came at a time Nigerians needed it the most, and not so surprisingly, in just one day, it has joined the list of best-sellers. Speaking on why he wrote the book, Dr. Hypocrisy said, “I have traveled around the world before settling in Nigeria because the people here are very pleasant. When I came, I had no influence, no wealth and no children, but now, I have many wives across the country. The book is about my time in Nigeria, and it is a very special tribute.”
Dr. Hypocrisy also confirmed the not-so-popular opinion that he got the idea from some politicians. He said, “One needs not be a politician before he can write a book about his stay in a place as nice as Nigeria. During my time in Nigeria, I have seen men like Oluseun Omosanjo, and Efele John Nathan who aren’t half as smart as I am write books. I know this knowledge I have must not live and die inside me, so I decided to join the league of writers by writing about the time I spent in the country.”
Below is a excerpt from the fantastic book:
At 60, I am seated in my car, writing my first book, and looking out at the beautiful country that housed me for more than 50 years of my life. Nigeria came many years before its time. Like Atlantis, the lost empire, Nigeria has the technology that the rest of the world does not have yet. The road design that involves multiple irregularly shaped holes for speed control was discovered in University of Ibara a few years back, and since then, only few countries have been able to copy the design. The road design effectively reduces collision with other vehicles, by promoting lone accidents. I look at the street lamps that stand majestically in the dark like statues, and I smile, as I remember how these types of street lamps require no maintenance. Government at all levels in Nigeria is truly wise.
Never mind my deviation. I got a little carried away by the beauty of the dark streets that look like a candlelit dinner arrangement illuminated by car headlights instead of candles. Back to my story, when I came to Nigeria, I tested the shields of Nigerians and noticed that they have a major weakness. Nigerians always need someone to blame, and the government is that person. The ruling party is the problem, politicians are the criminals, so when I came to Nigeria, I supported them, and they invited me into their houses, and served me meals. I didn’t have a job, I still don’t have one, but everyday, I wake up to breakfast in bed, as there is always one Nigerian who spent the time preaching what he doesn’t practice. In less than a month in the country, I had gotten myself a large group of followers who I callHypocrites.
The longer I spent in the country, the
more followers I got. I made the deeds of my followers look good to them, and
made the deeds of others look bad. Some of the questions I made them ask are: Who
exactly gave political office holders the right to inflate the price of projects,
when the only ones permitted to inflate the prices of goods and services are
the masses? Who gave those wealthy men the right to travel out of the country
when the masses are still looking for ways toport?
Soon after my household visits, I entered religious houses, and helped with the distortion of the words in holy books into something ugly in an artistic way. I showed everyone the significance of word of mouth, and how action doesn’t speak at all. At this stage, I had many followers. Both the religious leader and his followers were hypocrites, so there was no one to point out my presence in the congregation. After all, I am Dr. Hypocrisy, an invincible young man with big dreams, and lots of manipulative power. I showed them prerecorded videos of how other religions aren’t peaceful, and they believed me, and called other religions evil, even when people practicing their own religion kill each other while running for religious posts. I made Muslims believe that they are better than Christians as Christians are dubious, and made Christians believe they are better because Muslims are pedophiles, even though Pastor John is always staring at the pretty 4-year-old girls in church, and wishing their parents can leave them with him after Sunday School.
Nigerians are perfect for my ambition of
taking over the world. They make the work easy, as they are a self-righteous
bunch. They blame racists, but they are in fact worse than racists. The average
Nigerian parent doesn’t want his child to marry outside his tribe. Theirs is
the tale of audio love on social media when in the real world, they don’t like
each other. Even among themselves, they still segregate. There’s a great difference
between core Ibos and Delta Ibos, and there is a large difference between those
from Ibadan and those from Oyo town. My people aren’t racists. They just don’t
like who they don’t like.
Beyond tribe, there is age. My ever-receptive
Nigerians are always trying to be the righteous ones. The youth understand
through my help that the elders are the problem of the country, but all thanks
to me, even the elders see that the youth are the problem. Now, among the
youth, there is another group known as the hooligans. These ones are dropouts that
have no manners. They deserve to be punished by the police officers. Among the
youth, there are the police officers and military men who are well known for
their brutality. These ones deserve to be killed for their wickedness and
inhumane treatment of other youths. Don’t forget, the elders are the problem. They
are only trying to make the youth look bad by introducing these bad elements.
Among the elders are old corrupt politicians who, thanks to my help, are constantly blamed by other elders such as the innocent retirees who received bribe while they were in service. It is not the fault of the retirees. They helped themselves to a little bribe because the money wasn’t enough, but those politicians are just greedy. It’s not the fault of the politicians as well. Their position is temporary, so they have a reason to steal, but those retirees have a permanent job so why did they steal? They are just greedy!
I am not a bad person, I just don’t mind
taking advantage when it is presented. I pry on the weak and easy prey, and
Nigerians are pretty easy. Now that I have set the well oiled engine of
hypocrisy into motion, I can finally leave Nigeria, and move to another country
that is filled with sour milk and bitter honey. Though this might look like a
confession, it is not. I know Nigerians are like hens, and once I throw them
few hypocritical grains, they will pick them up, and forget I ever said this."

"US Forces rescue ONE American hostage, Nigerian Military leaves WhatsApp group",https://punocracy.com/us-forces-rescue-hostage-nigerian-military-leaves-whatsapp/,2020-11-01T04:20:08+01:00,"The Nigerian Armed Forces under the leadership of General Abayomi Olonisakin has recently left the classified WhatsApp group of World Armed Forces (WAF) over the actions of the United State’s SEAL Team Six launching an operation to rescue only one citizen in Northern Nigeria.
The general, while addressing Pressmen on Sunday, described the SEAL Team Six operation as sheer wastage of US tax payers’ resources and has since called on the armed forces of other countries to equally condemn their action.
He also accused the US President Donald Trump of taking his showmanship too far by using the PENTAGON to sanction the operation as a strategy for vote-buying by tricking Americans into believing that he prioritizes  their safety.
He fumed: “I mean, this is uncalled for, it is very petty and it’s unnecessarily making us look very bad.”
“How will you deploy such humongous resources to rescuing just one citizen? I mean, one single person and a farmer for that matter. That’s a waste of  hard-earned taxpayers’ money.  You see, this is not the first time that the US will be doing this and we’ve had enough, someone has to call them to order and to express our current displeasure, the Nigerian Military has left the classified WhatsApp group of World Armed Forces (WAF). Bad company, our elders say, corrupts good manners.
“I mean, the same resources committed to this wasteful endeavor would have been put to better use in the hands of Nigerian Military in a number of our various campaigns for Nigeria’s security and unity. For instance, the same amount of resources was what we deployed to Lekki Toll Gate to recover that important national landmark from hundreds of dangerous flag-waving-hoodlums who had laid siege to the place for more than a week.
“Another way we could use it by deploying more personnel to our cyber-warfare unit where they’ll help us fight fake news on Twitter by posting screenshots of damaging news report fromlamestreammedia and watermarking them with ‘fake news’,” he said.
Olonisakin added that it was not new and out of place for “stupid” citizens to put themselves in such ridiculous situation like the US citizen that allowed himself to be kidnapped by bandits in another man’s country.
“Trust me, it is not new. But, while to put themselves in such situation is for the citizens, to refuse to rescue them is soldierly. See, let me tell you a classified secret, we receive such calls almost every day but guess what? We don’t care!” he said while laughing hysterically, retrieving what looks like crisp from his big pocket and stuffing them in his mouth in an Elsa-Majimbo-inspired style.
“If we have to mobilise resources every time a Nigerian is kidnapped in India or being unjustly punished in South Africa, tell me, how many military personnel would remain to protect Nigerian VVIPS?” he asked rhetorically.
“How many will protect national landmarks from  hoodlums masquerading as ‘peaceful protesting children’? How many will remain to be invited by state governors to help them implement curfews? How many will guard hoarded palliatives? Or when the palliatives are being looted, how many will supervise it? How many?”"
Diary of Agent Flash Ola,https://punocracy.com/diary-of-agent-flash-ola/,2020-10-29T09:30:28+01:00,"By:Machiavelli Miga
Our dearest Mini Star cum secret agent has
released a special diary of events leading up to his finding of a secret video
recorder in the now infamous Lekki Toll Gate.
25/10/2020
No minister has said anything concerning the alleged massacre or is it the nefarious activities that happened in Lekki toll gate. Why should I be the first? I heard a Wikipedia page was even dedicated to the alleged people that died, these youths are truly jobless. By the way, the president said nothing about it in his speech the other day, why should I be the first? And his speech was so perfect, I mean that was absolutely the right time to let Nigerians acknowledge the success of Trader Monie and all other monies. They should be happy we did not siphon these schemes and look how they pay us back, with protests! Ungrateful lots!
On second thought, I’m a current Mini Star and former governor of the state where the sad event happened. I’m supposed to at least lend a voice. But no, I’ll follow the president’s body language and align accordingly.
26/10/2020
Rabiu my CSO wakes me up. “Things are getting out of hand, oga mi. The looting, pillaging, and rioting has continued unabated in Lagos. I think it’s high time you did something o. Good morning Sir.” My chef knocks and hands me breakfast on bed. I turn and look at Rabiu. A full-fledged Hausa man that was born and bred in Lagos. He can barely speak Hausa but his Yoruba is thicker than some governor’s babariga; if I don’t tell you, youKanoknow.
Rabiu is rarely wrong. I have to listen to him. “Okay, make the necessary arrangements, we’re going to Lekki.”
“All correct Sir, I will inform theadviceteam outrightly. Will you be using your private jet or helicopter, sir?”
I replied the latter. I’ll want Nigerians to know I also feel their pains and not be caught in a PJ. I will have even preferred using the road but for time constraints. These are the things Nigerians don’t know we pass through for them, yet we get insulted daily for earning a few millions that’s never enough.
I arrive Lekki. With the advance team, we proceed to the toll gate alongside the state governor’s small convoy of 22 cars. On arrival by 1:14PM, I do a random observation of the facilities. Naturally my instincts kick in; I should put on hand gloves. But the camera and media people might misinterpret it that I have ulterior motives. My nose mask already raised a few eyebrows. I simply put my hands behind my back and go on a thorough inspection of the Lekki toll gate. Instructions have since been given to journos that I dare not be asked anything about whatever occurred here on October 20, 2020. It’s not like I was here either to ascertain what happened.
I look up and my eyes pick something. On a closer look it was a camcorder neatly hidden between the metal structures in the toll gate. I need no  forensic agent to tell me this was a custom-made James Bond genus video recorder. It can withstand heat, fires, sun, and rain for days while recording non-stop and still come out looking fresh. I saw the same replica while I was training with MI6 back in the 90s in UK.
It’s easy to miss out on this, especially for the untrained eye. It was made using camouflage technology. On the surface it looks like any other metal but on a closer look, it’s actually a video recorder. This is after all why it’s called VTS 419 Camcorder Chameleon. How did it even get here? Do the Britons already know? Hmmm.
Rabiu finally noticed it too and proceeded as overzealous as ever to help me remove it but I barked him off. Using an handkerchief, I carefully removed it and placed it for all to see. What Rabiu doesn’t know is that the camcorder is also designed to capture and conceal fingerprints. Most Nigerians don’t know we have advanced fingerprints technology here in the country and the details of the source of the database are a bit sketchy at the moment.
Glad that I have done my bit to fast track whatever occurrences reportedly happened in the toll gate. I handed the tape to the states C.S.O. and hopefully it can help in explaining whatever fiasco occurred between civilians and the military in Lekki.

Hoodlums hijack Palliatives Ultimate Search (PUS) 2020,https://punocracy.com/hoodlums-hijack-palliatives-ultimate-search-pus-2020/,2020-10-28T07:11:13+01:00,"Machiavelli Miga
The wonderful people in Nigeria have been thrown into disarray and pandemonium seems to have broken out in various parts of the country. Warehouses supposedly housing Covid-19 palliatives are now being broken into and stored palliatives carted away by many citizens. Some call them hoodlums (probably because they’re from the hood). Others see them as miscreants and thugs. There is no denying the fact that these opportunists are risking their lives, damning the consequences in the process and helping themselves to as much palliatives as possible.
But was it supposed to be so?
My sources have it on good authority that the National Orientation Agency in partnership with the Ministry of Youth and Sports had planted palliatives worth billions of naira in different states of the federation including the FCT to fast-track unity, togetherness and above all fitness of Nigerians. Ask yourself, when last did we all run to keep fit, are we still agile? My thoughts exactly!
You may be wondering how this will be
possible.
With the help of the Department of Security of State Services (DSSS), the Ministry of Youths and Sports and N.O.A, had placed these palliatives in strategic places around the country that will be opened on the 1st of November.
The plan was to formally inform the public through various media houses that the Palliatives Ultimate Search (2020) has began. Three locations will be given with only one being the right one. The thrill and hunt will all be covered live. Security agents especially those in the Civil Defence Corps were specifically trained for this to avoid stampede. The end goal will be to see how fast the citizens can find the right palliatives warehouse and the size of what they can carry.
Prices were to be awarded to participants in various categories including; pace, guile, tenacity, strength, balance, etc.
However, some unscrupulous elements alongside government agents, not contended with the grand plans for 1st of November when the Palliatives Ultimate Search was to kick off, went ahead to reveal the locations of these warehouses to their cronies who told their cronies resulting in the wanton bastardization of the plans of the government to this end. These cronies told others making a large population of the masses to be aware of the location of the palliatives, leading to the looting of the place, and effectively ending the good plans the government had set aside for the people.
A citizen was caught on tape balancing two 50kg of sewing machine in the Idu area of Abuja on both shoulders whilst still walking majestically with balanced gait. Such an individual could easily have won the 500k price earmarked for the most balanced citizen during the event scheduled for next month. Another was seen in Ilorin balancing a giant GP tank on his head. We all know that it takes one versatile in the laws of physics, especially equilibrium, to perform such a balancing act with minimum fuss.
In Calabar, Blessing Ekpenyong reports that the palliatives were found in the garment factory. Recall the the state governor, Mr. Bend Aya Deh, had shed tears on camera lamenting the hunger in the land. This was all done to bring more highlights to the need for palliatives to be shared and not hoarded. In Lagos, palliatives were found hidden in the Palace of the Oba of Lagos. You might be wondering why such a location, it was all a grand scheme for a greater thrill when the Palliatives Ultimate Search commences. Unfortunately, the Obas staff of Office, shoes, and personal belongings have been converted to palliatives and the gods seem to not to have bat an eyelid at such a desecration of the sacred tool of office of their forefathers. Spits!
Reacting to this, the chief organiser of the scheduled event for next month, Mrs Omo Tola, described the acts of the hoodlums as nefarious, selfish, and generally primitive. Recall she was the one who tweeted that there are no evidence of dead bodies from the Lekki toll gate shooting and everyone was only crying foul play falsely. The tweet was long deleted; rumours have it she was hacked.
In her words to our correspondent, A.J, Uboh, “The the federal government had earlier this year set aside 1st of November for a massive revelation of different locations where palliatives were located so that citizens can get there in haste and help themselves to as much as possible granted they’re carrying it and not dragging anything on the floor to avoid stampede. Security agents have been trained to this regard. It was to be named Palliatives Ultimate Search 2020.”
Asked about reports that some of the allegedly looted palliatives, especially food items, were already getting spoilt, Mrs Tola reacted by saying the expired, decaying or spoilt palliatives were never from the warehouse but from abandoned farms. Stating further to Uboh, she said it’s probably the work of the opposition hell-bent on bringing to nought the good policies of the current administration. The opposition simply infiltrated the masses with spoilt food items to make it seem like it had been stored since April when everything there was stored as early as the 1st of October.
On this note, the Palliatives Ultimate Search 2020 team has been disbanded as the citizens have instead taken the initiative on themselves to risk their lives to forcefully acquire what was to be given to them in an orderly manner. The government regrets this reality, has counted her losses, and prays for a prosperous nation where leaders can continuously hoard food items until such a time when the masses will actually really need it, which is usually just before elections.

"#BoJexit: Blood of Jesus flees Nigeria, relocates to Canada",https://punocracy.com/bojexit-blood-of-jesus-flees-nigeria/,2020-10-25T23:17:06+01:00,"Blood of Jesus,
Nigeria’s default insurance provider, has fled the country for Canada citing
personal abuse, mental health and human right reasons.
He jumped on a flight to Vancouver on Friday amidst killings and lootings in the aftermath of the popular #EndSARS protests.
In a video that has
since gone viral on WhatsApp, he said that it became necessary for him to leave
Nigeria because he does not feel safe again.
He continued:
“Everyone has their own limit, everyone as a point they reach that they
can take no more and I think I have reached mine.
“I have been enduring this for decades and I have honestly been trying to cope, when Nigerians buy a new car, they cover it with the blood of Jesus, when they build a new house, they cover it with the blood of Jesus, when they start a business, they cover it with the blood of Jesus, when they are going on a Journey they cover it with the blood of Jesus, when they are investing in a Ponzi Scheme, they cover it with the blood of Jesus, even their lives are covered with the blood of Jesus!”
He lamented that
looking at the rate at which Nigerians are abusing him, it’s just a matter of
time before he runs out of blood himself, and eventually, his life.
He added: “Please, don’t get me wrong! I am not saying it’s a bad thing to cover your misfortunes with my blood but at least, you should seek my consent, that’s the standard practice everywhere. Unfortunately, that’s not the case with Nigerians and this is taking quite a big toll on my mental health and I have only been able to last this long because of help from my friends at MANI.”
He further revealed
that the last straw that broke his camel’s back was the massacre that happened
in Lekki last Tuesday and the various destructions of lives and properties that
trailed the unfortunate incident.
“Parents have
lost their children. Children have lost their parents. And many people have
lost one or more relative just as many businesses are being looted across the
country. These are people and properties covered with my blood but I couldn’t
protect! Not because I don’t want to protect them but it’s just impossible to
be in Ojoo, Lekki and thousands of other places at the same time, it is just
insane!
“Though I heard the court at Igbosere was burnt but still I cannot remain in Nigeria while risking one clueless Mr. Garbage joining me in a class action lawsuit with Jack in a matter wherein I am completely helpless and innocent. And even if they refuse to sue me, I know Nigerians, for the sake of my mental health, I can’t stand their whining,” he concluded.
However, Aletilapa, a young Nigerian echoing the opinions of the majority has taken to social media to express the helplessness of the people and also to condemn the exit of Blood of Jesus saying: “Who do we now turn to for cover when Nigeria rains bullets on us? Who do we call on for help to protect us against looting? Who do we turn to? We can not just stay here without cover? Canada has something that legitimately belongs to us and we are coming…”
Meanwhile, the chairman of the National Confederation of Insurance Providers (NCIP), Dr. Ofowumi Cover, has expressed his excitement over the exit of Blood of Jesus noting that his exit might just be the mark of a new dawn in insurance culture in Nigeria.
Recall thatA’uzubillahi, a distant cousin toBlood of Jesus, also left Nigeria for the UK a couple of years ago during the peak of terrorism in Northern Nigeria and has refused to come back ever since. His last activity on Twitter was a retweet of “Japa” video by Naira Marley.

Dictator(ship) dey disguise: On Buhari’s address to Nigerians,https://punocracy.com/dictatorship-dey-disguise-on-buharis-address-to-nigerians/,2020-10-24T09:19:38+01:00,"By: Faridat Ibrahim
The past four days have been trying times. The country has been visibly shaken by the deliberate shooting of peaceful protesters in Lekki. This calculated malevolence has brought tears to many eyes, birthed fear, and squeezed sympathy from more foreigners. Even Beyonce finally donated food, what we needed the most. A silver lining may have been the discovery of a CA-COVID warehouse and the distribution of the hoarded resources on behalf of the government. But amidst the ruckus, one thing was noticeable: presidential silence.
So noticeable, presidents, embassies, international organizations began pleading on behalf of the people with the presidency to at least calm the violence upturning major cities in the country. Every corner on Twitter, there was someone begging the president to announce something related to the Lekki massacre. Since forces beyond Sanwo-Olu’s control orchestrated the attack and subsequent sporadic shooting on the streets of Lagos, we were eager and clamouring to hear from the dictator-in-chief. However underwhelming his speech would be, the world was looking forward to it.
Our very shy supreme leader finally succumbed to the pressure by releasing a pre-recorded video. Half a bread is better than none. This pressure was evident in his speech which began with, “It has become necessary for me to address you.” After registering his displeasure at being bullied into speaking, he quickly threatened the miscreants whose action necessitated his coming out.
He lightly brushed the use of excessive force to repel protesters who were exercising their constitutional rights. Make no assumptions; he didn’t express remorse over bastardizing protesters. He is not that charitable. However, he paid generous respect to police officers, corrupt or less-corrupt, whose lives were tragically lost in line of duty.
Futhermore, he used the medium to express profound regret over his swift response to our agitation. Classic Buhari would have rolled out war tanks to finish off protesters right from day one. He instead decided to take the high road because he was not that man anymore. The rebranded man he is today consented to the replacement of SARS with SWAT (Special Weapon and Tactics Squad) which could pose more severe threats to the security of youths for all we know. That benevolent gesture, he insinuates, should be lauded.
With a dismissive undertone, he advised people to move on with their lives and not request justice for people who were intentionally killed for breaking no laws. He warned people to keep off the streets — else more forces would be employed to keep them indoors.
He went on to implore us to go about their daily business like nothing ever happened. Then, he mentioned in detail his regime’s masterplan that is projected to lessen poverty statistics by 100 million in the next 10 years. This came as shocking news to many because his tyrannical hold over the country should come to end in less than three years. Setting that misunderstanding –from his end – aside a little, he highlighted Tradermoni, Farmermoni, Marketmoni, and other monis as the pathways to the proposed achievement, and then enjoined more youths to enroll and keep off the streets to maintain his nascent democracy.
With what sounded like a crafty but stern dismissal of concern, General Buhari silenced “our neighbours in particular”, enjoining them to do their research before hastily commiserating with the people’s plight. The perfect Nigerian expression for that would be: “No be your business. Dey your dey, make I dey my dey.”
Nothing meaningful ever yields from his lackluster speeches but, for the tiny fraction of a second, Nigerians hoped for bare minimum. In all the merry-go-rounding, he adamantly evaded the issue of the coordinated Lekki massacre and the question still bugging the minds of many is: who ordered the massacre of 20thOctober 2020?
Intel reaching us confirms that the
address was given by Jubril, the dictator. In light of the aforementioned, we
wait to hear from Buhari, the democrat.

Buari’s speech on Lekki Massacre still being edited,https://punocracy.com/buaris-speech-on-lekki-massacre-still-being-edited/,2020-10-23T07:52:50+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― The presidency has asked Nigerians to be patient for the part II of Mahmud Buari’s speech to the country on the End SARS campaign, explaining that the section containing his position on the Lekki Massacre and other key issues is still with the video editor.
“Let’s be honest, it will take some time before we can release a finished product,” said senior presidential spokesperson, Garuba Shior.
“The president just could not stop laughing when we presented the speech to him and he kept punctuating his condolence to the victims with unsavory giggles. We are sending the recording to Bollywood producers to see if they can work magic on it.”
Asked how long it will take, Shior replied that maybe a year, “or two — we have our fingers crossed”.
“We really did not plan for the president to give this many speeches this year. The logistics for producing one speech alone could take weeks. It’s been an absolute disaster. Just bear with us,” he pleaded.
A short footage of the session glimpsed by ourCorrespondent of Probable Fictionshows the president banging on the table in front of him as he burst into raucous laughter. He had just stuttered through the word “con—con—dol — lence”.
Other parts of the speech that elicited a similar response from Buari included those assuring there would not be repeat occurrence of the unfortunate killings of protesters at the Lekki toll-gate area and committing to the establishment of a Victim Support Fund for the families of the deceased.
“Why else do we have Tradermoni and the Youth Investment Fund?” he snickered.
Meanwhile, a close aide to the president informed The T.A. Report that the reason not a single person has so far resigned is because no provisions were made in the budget for resignation letters.
“This is something you plan for, you see. We don’t do things like that arbitrarily. We have been debating whether to slip about N2 billion in the 2021 budget for this purpose, but then again Vice President Osibande said God forbid,” the source said.
“I have prayed about it; there will be no reasons for resignation till 2023 in Jesus’ name,” he added, quoting the VP.

"Again, VP’s heart ‘goes out’ for some fresh air",https://punocracy.com/again-vps-heart-goes-out-for-some-fresh-air/,2020-10-22T07:45:33+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― The restless heart of Nigeria’s Vice President, Professor Yemii Osibande (PYO), has again gone out for some fresh air in the light of the ongoing civil war declared by the government against its own people.
Osibande shared his heart’s movements minutes to midnight on Wednesday, perhaps hoping that gunshots (which now light up the Nigerian skies better than stars) would be enough to keep the Twitter TL awake.
“My heart goes out to all the victims of the Lekki shootings, and also the  policemen and all other men and women who lost their lives in the past few days in different parts of Lagos and other states,” the professor, who famously doubles as the country’s Minister of Condolences,said. “We pray we will never see a repeat of these tragedies in Jesus name. God bless you all.”
He signed the statement as “YO”, apparently forgetting that he was also the Vice President and number two citizen.
Nigerians suggest that the condolence minister is likely not aware of how many people truly died during the tragic incident at Lekki because “there is no way his heart could have visited all of them in such a short period”.
“We don’t need his nomadic heart to go out to victims,” one Lekki protest survivor said. “That is what his feet are meant for. Besides, we are tired of having a Vice President whose heart is always bleeding. All we want is for our own to keep beating.”
Meanwhile, information reaching The T.A. Report is that Osibande’s speechwriter has nearly exhausted all available synonyms for “condolence” and may soon need to start recycling old press statements.
“I wish I were writing for Bad Boy instead,” he admitted to someone who then told our correspondent. “The pay is better and I hardly have to do anything.Gaskiya, all I need to write are birthday messages and speeches to commemorate a few public holidays.”

Following years of military disgrace by Boko Haram teens, our soldiers (fondly called Zombi-o by Fela) last night restored the Army’s glory in a battle against flag-waving#EndSARSprotesters who had attacked first with verses of Nigeria’s dangerous National Anthem.
The government’s policy of breeding the world’s largest herd of 13+ million uneducated school-age kids paid huge dividends as touts, too dim to recognise their own interests, joined government in sabotaging their compatriots’#EndSARSprotests.
In a brilliant tactical move, the Army — aka POPS (Politicians’ Orderly & Protection Service) dodged cutlass-wielding, police-station-burning touts on Lagos mainland and deployed to liberate the lucrative#LekkiTollgates(aka Eko-o-ni-Baje Oil Wells), from chanting Young Radicals.
The Nigerian Army, which had earlierachieved a featof Military Irony for raping victims of Boko Haram, went one better by shooting tax payers with bullets bought by tax payers waving the Nigerian flag.
The#Lekkitollgate, which was burned after the#LekkiMassacre, may remain closed permanently, as a memorial to the dead youths and the dead letters of the Nigerian constitution that guaranteed their right to life. (But do not hold your breath.)
The operation was led by Lt Col S.O. Bello, who had long resented hisnon-inclusion(with colleagues, Maj Gen Ewansiha, Maj Gen Ethnan, Maj Gen Mohammed, Brig Gen Edokpayi, & Brig Gen Bamigboye) in the prestigious Amnesty International List of Officers to be Tried for War Crimes.
‘Why Lekki, and not Sambisa?’ asked puzzled Nigerians. So their Army explained how despite thousands of civilian kills,#NigerianArmyMassacreshad failed to trend. Yet, a mere police unit with hundreds of civilian kills had achieved global fame with the#EndSARShashtag.
‘Why live bullets, and not water cannons, or rubber bullets?’ asked weeping Nigerians. “The police may be your “friend”,’ smiled the Army, “I warned you: I am#Crocodile.”
The#EndSARS#NigerianArmyMassacremarks another successful outing in the long history of the Nigerian Army’s specialisation in thekilling of unarmed civilians, dating back from the Asaba Massacre (’67), through Odi (’99) to Zaria (’15).
With#LekkiMassacreour Army jazzed up state terrorism by fusing two separate war crimes, Massacre and Disappearance. Thus, victims arekilled publiclyfor maximum terror impact,thentheir corpses are stolen, enabling Governor@jidesanwooluto deny that anyone died.

Buharii wonders why Nigerians are still protesting despite high-level meetings,https://punocracy.com/buharii-wonders-why-nigerians-are-still-protesting/,2020-10-19T07:22:04+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Nigeria’s perplexed President, Mahmud Buharii, now fondly known asBubu the Bad Boy, has asked why none of the government’s tactics in getting the #EndSARS protests to end seems to be working.
In a meeting with his kitchen cabinet on Sunday,Bad Boycomplained bitterly about the stubbornness of the protesters, our Correspondent on Secret Meetings gathered.
“What have we not done in the past two weeks? We have released, what, about 10 press statements? I have met with several top government officials and shared stunning pictures of these high-level meetings to assure Nigerians of my personal involvement. We have in fact, you know, technically defeated SARS and replaced two of the letters. My wife’s solidarity tweet did not even have any effect; maybe I should ask her to go talk to BBC Hausa for more distraction since these protests are now spreading to the north,” he lamented.
“What else do these children want? We launched the Youth Investment Fund and Youth Empowerment Scheme to calm them down but it didn’t work. We even showed them photos of beautiful Keke NAPEP and motorcycles that we will give them but, erm, will still ban later.
“They want a 77-year-old man to start visiting the families of victims? Have we not agreed that Osibande should release a powerful condolence message? Have governors not paid visits to some of the families? Don’t they know there are bigger issues that need my attention in Abuja like meeting with Goodluck to discuss the crisis in Mali and expressing condolences to heads of state contracting COVID-19 across the world?”
Bad Boyadded that it seems the only trick the government has not tried is unleashing the full force of the armed forces on the protesters.
“But those shiite people have refused to resign to fate despite all the intimidation from Burujai. These young protesters look even crazier! Imagine they are even bypassing our attempts to block their source of funding and are hiring their own security guards.”
“I still suspect that the FeDeFe have a hand in this,” he concluded. “Or Iran. Or America. They can’t be trusted.”
Following the meeting, Buharii asked Fem De-sin to again check “the situation in the UK” and confirm that his unrestrained access to quality healthcare facilities has not been diplomatically compromised as a result of the protests.
“I can’t wait to go for my routine check-up, but I’m afraid that Osibande will go and do something stupid in my absence,” he whispered to his loyal spokesperson before chuckling heartily, as he did when he heard about how seriously the Lagos State government was addressingthispolice brutality thing.

How to be a sane Nigerian,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-sane-nigerian/,2020-10-19T07:10:29+01:00,"By: John Chizoba Vincent
Anger in the midst of a beloved and lovely country like ours has a long history of bringing about short lifespan to you. You have to be happy for being a Nigerian with a beautiful future and caring Leaders. In a very defining context, Vera Nazarian once said that if you are faced with a mountain, you have several options. You can climb it and cross to the other side. You can go around it. You can dig under it. You can fly over it. You can blow it up. You can ignore it and pretend it’s not there. You can turn around and go back the way you came. Or you can stay on the mountain and make it your home. Nigeria is that wonderful mountain Vera is talking about. You are free to do whatsoever suits you here.
However, you know you’ll be such an educated fool hoping for the government of the federal republic of Nigeria to take back all those wonderful things they have provided for you to make your life beautiful? Imagine them taking away the quality education they gave to you at the university level or secondary and primary levels, how would you manage to be enlightened in life? Imagine if the PHCN removed an hour from the 24/7 power supply they give to you, how would you manage to survive? Imagine if some parts of the roads in Lagos state and other states developed potholes, how would your car manage to be safe? Imagine if this country divides! Just imagine what would become of the other parts without cows for meat. Just imagine! You’re Nigerialised to be better than foreigners.
Meanwhile, to be a sane Nigerian you must forget about the southern Kaduna killings, forget about the Benue killings, then the Jos killings and the Enugu killings. In fact, those killings were executed by cattle overfed by their masters. Do you want to keep bothering yourself about deaths caused by animals? Besides, the victims have no ties to any of your family, then, why worry about their death?
You must forget about the Chibok girls as well. Remind your heart that it was a story cooked up by the enemies of Nigeria for political purposes. How could such a group of girls be gone till now without being traced? To be a straight Nigerian, you must not ask how the national cake is shared. What is your business with that? Let me tell you, you shouldn’t remember what they meant by police brutality or mismanagement of funds, all these are ways through which our enemies lie. Don’t remember also those people they said were killed by SARS; how could those appointed to go after armed robbers turn around to kill innocent Citizens? Is that not insanity? You must forget becauseforgetfulnessis a name every sane Nigerian living in today’s Nigeria bears.
There was a time of herdsmen rampage in Benue. I think they told you about it. But let me remind you again that those herdsmen were men who brought their kinsmen from Niger republic to be slaughtered in Nigeria, it wasn’t Nigerians killing Nigerians. I was still in Benue then and I still didn’t know what to say about those lies they fed your ears with. How could a Nigerian kill a Nigerian? No! This is not possible. A sane Nigerian doesn’t kill a sane Nigerian. A sane—patriotic Nigerian doesn’t listen to lies; rather they listen to whatsoever their government has to say. To be a sane Nigerian, you must not talk bad of your government or those in power. You must respect them and pray for them even when they are said to loot the public funds; you must keep praying for them and defend them publicly because it is your civic right.
I’ll be 35 in the next few months. I have lived in this country for 35 years. It has been fair and kind to me. I have achieved a lot without stress. I have had the time to nurse hopes, dreamt dreams of its greatness, hoped in the faith of elections to keep this country in unity. I have always seen Nigeria’s light ever since I was a small boy growing up in Aba. I have always seen the government carrying the affairs of this country in their hearts, abandoning their own family’s needs. I am always speechless at the level at which our leaders have worked to make sure this country is safe in all ramification.
There has been the story of Boko Haram told in different ways to pull down their works but they stood to save us. This Country and her Leaders they said like to pick the flowers of dead bodies, so they have hired unknown bandits, snipers, gunmen, Boko Haram fighters, militant herdsmen, and snakes in monkey shadows, to be their gardeners. But, I said to them that this country and its leaders are the best things to have happened to Africa and the world.
I am in Borno now. I am standing in one of those places that were said to be burnt down by Boko Haram but I can’t find any zinc burnt or a place destroyed by bomb. And many times I’ve tried not to live under a climate of lies people have told others about this sweet home but failed. They sit in the dark and ask themselves what if the haramists invade again when there is no Boko Haram. Some asked: what if a bomb goes off somewhere? But have you ever heard the sound of a bomb explosion in Nigeria? I don’t think so.
Those days, our parents told us a lot of sweet things about Nigeria. We looked for these things while growing up and we found them everywhere, every time we search for them. In fact, this country gets better and greater every passing day. What else do you want from a sane country that feeds students daily before they go to school? What more do you want from a country that pays her youth monthly allowances and then takes care of the elders? Some people are trying to blackmail others into some kind of immoral complicity.
The federal government of Nigeria has tried and you can only help them to do more as a sane Nigerian if you work with them and be of good behavior. Perhaps one day those people seeking for revolution willnotsee it happen. It seems this is the only way to keep this country in unity. What do we want to restructure again? What? Our leaders are great leaders and this home isnota trap we’re all in. Do not ask what happened to Dino Melaye then, when he spoke up. Do not ask what happened to Sowore or where Dadiyata is. Those are some of the people this country doesn’t want to have as citizens. They are not sane Nigerians. You know? You don’t need to hear whatever they have to say again!
Nigeria is your home. You will definitely come back to it after running away from all these glorious things she has to offer you. It is ironical how many of us run away from a place of milk and honey to what Europe, America and Asia have to offer us. How come we don’t value good things when they come easily to us all? We are first Nigerian before anything else. This is where we belong, our home.

‘Not like we were using them before’: FG to Anonymous on hacked sites,https://punocracy.com/fg-to-anonymous-on-hacked-sites/,2020-10-17T09:52:15+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― The Federal Government has reacted to a spate of attacks launched against websites and Twitter handles belonging to some of its agencies by Anonymous, an international hacktivist movement, and said the group was free to keep them.
“It is not like we were using them before anyway,” said presidential spokesperson Fem De-sin during an interview on Sunset Weekly.
“This is exactly why we don’t put too much information on our websites. We have always known a time would come when doing so could threaten national peace and security,” he added.
Another problem, he said, is that to constantly update and maintain online platforms, the government would need to employ many young hands, who “we honestly do not trust to keep doing things the way they have always been done”.
Some of the affected platforms include the websites of the Independent National Electoral Commission, National Industrial Court, and the Edo State Government, as well as the Twitter handle of the National Broadcasting Commission.
De-sin said going forward, the country would invest more in paper documentation, television and radio broadcasts, as well as town criers as means of recording and disseminating information. “Our forefathers and founding fathers knew what they were doing when they relied on these tools; plus we would even be creating more jobs, especially once we employ 1,000 town criers in each local government area,” he explained.
“Our government has already embarked on this backward journey to development. Didn’t you see when the Lagos State governor printed pictures of the explosion in Abule-Ado and went to Abuja to show the president? Didn’t you see how good it looked in the cameras when recently the Vice President viewed tweet printouts from his office desk? That is the Nigeria of the future, friends.”
Anonymous’ spokesperson, who (of course) asked for anonymity, told our correspondent that while websites and social media accounts run by the Nigerian government have been extremely easy to hack, the group has not seen “a more barren set of government sites in its years of activism”.
“Many of them are running on very old technology and the job was far too easy. But it was like someone giving you his debit card and PIN only for you to find out that the account has become dormant or is totally empty,” he said, still in shock.
“The emails are not any better. The few functioning addresses are hardly used, so we had to start infiltrating personal emails.”
Meanwhile, it was gathered that, in view of the recent cyber-attacks, the federal ministry of communications and digital economy is set to propose a security upgrade for government websites, said to cost between N10 and N15 billion.
“While the actual upgrade should require about N100 million, we need the remaining sum to, you know, take care of miscellaneous expenses,” one partly reliable source told us.

How to gossip about the good government of Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-gossip-about-the-good-government-of-nigeria/,2020-10-17T09:31:02+01:00,"By: John Chizoba Vincent
Every Governor in Nigeria is a Messiah from heaven. Nigerian leaders are such great people we need to pray for whenever we wake up from bed. Like the Lagos State Governor, he has been a wonderful father to all Lagosians. He left Lagos to Abuja to see Mr President to settle the protesting youths so that they could leave the Tollgate. Lagos has already lost lots of money while the protest was going on and the state needs money to take care of those people living in it and those visitors coming into the state every day.
Likewise Ikpeazu, he has been a supportive father too to Abians. Haven’t you seen how beautiful Abia state looks right now? From Ohanku road to Ngwa road and Port Harcourt road, have you not seen the roads? He has made everything beautiful in his own way. Yahayah, Wike and many others who are the governors of their respective state are the most hard-working people I have ever seen on earth. We are blessed to have them all as spiritual fathers.
Interestingly, as a citizen living in Lagos or Nigeria, you don’t need to worry much about your well-being, the government has taken care of that and while gossiping about the generosity of Lagos state government sitting on a round table with your friends and bottles of Jameson or Heineken or Hero placed on the table either in Quillox or Rumours hotel, remember every dog belongs to the government and they could tell their bosses how patriotic you are as a Lagosian or a Nigerian.
You must lower your voice while talking to your friends, sip your drink a little, then tell them how the Lagos state government has made you feel like a happy Nigerian or like a little child whose mother just got him Christmas shoes and clothes. Then, your friends would clap their hands jokingly and laugh loudly at your statement. Later, they would put their hands on their waists and look at you again passionately and laugh because they know that intelligence is a culture limited to no one tribe. Any thinking man would know that the Lagos state government has always been there for her citizens from the beginning of time. This is why she is called Lagos, a home for all luxuries and bling hustlers.
There is no need to be afraid of being a Nigerian. Everything is designed to make you a perfect man, not to kill you. From commerce to education and entertainment and security agencies. Nigerians now enjoy 24/7 power supply and good roads and water. School children of all levels now have breakfast before going to school courtesy of the federal government. Interestingly, the government of the federal republic of Nigeria has been the pillar of strength to the masses. No single citizen has the right to gossip about them in a bad manner.
Whenever you see men seated in a bar, they are gossiping about how good this country has been to them from time immemorial. They are gossiping about how everywhere and everything in Nigeria is secured and protected. You can walk to any Nigerian police in the street when in trouble and he would lay down his life to protect you. Police is our friend, isn’t what we were told? And the government is the people, so why are you afraid of armed robbers when the police force is strong enough to protect and secure your life?
The government has provided many weapons that would make their work easier and better. The only thing to be afraid of is yourself. You can betray yourself anytime and these policemen won’t know how to keep you safe whenever you betray yourself. You see, the Nigerian government in their faithfulness has provided everything you need as a Nigerian citizen and you are expected to be patriotic when necessary and defend your country at all levels. You must speak well of the country to a foreigner whenever you come across one in your locale or online. Isn’t this place paradise enough for you to live after all?
Besides, don’t forget that those people clamouring that the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) should be disbanded are those who are involved in cyberspace crime, 419 and many other things that damage the image of Nigeria and this is the reason why the president has not come to the national television to address the people. He knows what he is doing. How could an ordinary Nigerian wear a designer clothes like Gucci, Fendi, Versace and others while the president isn’t wearing one? Why should an ordinary Nigerian ride a Benz while the President is constructing a road that private jet would ride on? He doesn’t need Benz on Nigerian roads. I hope you know that. How could an ordinary Nigerian lock his hair when the President and the Governors are on low cut? It doesn’t make sense! How could a common citizen pierce his ears, tint his hair when the President hasn’t done that as our first father or the first citizen?
Perhaps, you now see why we need SARS to take charge of these boys and girls growing faster than their shadows. It is not hard to be a legend in Nigeria, all you have to do is to dress like politicians, become a governor or a senator or even the president himself and learn how to raise your one hand up occasionally while trying to greet people in public or rather in a public gathering.
This is the right way to gossip about the goodness of the Nigerian government: Learn to talk about the good roads all over the country. Then talk about the favourable petrol price and why it is necessary that the government increase the pump price. Talk about the youths that have been employed all over the country. Talk about the industries the government built. You should not forget to give wonderful details about the electricity tariff, the palliatives that were given to Nigerians during the coronavirus pandemic. Talk about the money that was given to the snake to swallow for safe keeping. Talk about how our educational system was ranked among the first in the world. These are many great ways to gossip about the good government in Nigeria.
In fact, you could talk about these things in Western Avenue in Ojuelegba, or Ozumba Mbadiwe street, Victoria Island or somewhere in Ngwa road, Port Harcourt road or Ohanku. These places have beautiful environments where you can set your tables or spread your wrapper and gossip about many of those good things that the government has provided for all Nigerians after they were elected.
Meanwhile, you should always make your voice loud and clear while gossiping about these things because when the media picks your voice, they could make you a celebrity as a patriotic Nigerian. Who knows, you could become bigger than Laycon or Wizkid for representing Nigeria? A good Nigerian should be one who sees all the good things his government has done for him and says it to others. When you keep quiet after the government has provided for you all that you need to make your life easier and beautiful, you become a bad citizen — an experiment to those people that foreigners delay at their airport because they are bad Nigerians. And bad Nigerians are bad representatives in the foreign world.
John Chizoba Vincents become the names of three people who deliberately see through each other. Sometimes, they are at war with each other and at times, they are the ties that never got broken. They: Them: Us: We represent boys and their anatomies, men and their vulnerabilities, and humans and their imperfections. Between them are rosy track roads that are rough and tough. They live in a lonely room in Lagos, Nigeria. They have been published widely online magazines and offline magazines. They are the founder of Philm Republic Pictures and Co-founder, Boys Are Not Stones Initiative; an organization that uphold the love for the BoyChild."
Why we cannot #EndSARS,https://punocracy.com/why-we-cannot-endsars/,2020-10-12T09:07:08+01:00,"By: Ibrahim Williams
I want you all to know one thing for sure. You
can never please everyone in life.
For a couple of days now social media has been
buzzing with rants, cries and clamours. And the streets have been steaming with
continuous protest all across the nation. For what reason? The youngsters want
an end to SARS.
Isn’t it a shame, that the young citizens of this country have always failed to recognize and appreciate the tedious work we’ve been doing in the presidency and the police flush? Fine, we know we are the type of leaders that ignore our burning homes to quench the spark at other people’s houses. Fine, we know we love to show our concern for Donald Trump when he contracts Covik-19 than say a word to the growing virus of insecurities in our country. Fine, we know we keep quiet when you young people cry, bleed and die every day. But does that make us bad leaders? Are you not aware that every blessed day, we pray for you? And that we always have you in our minds? Why then have you decided to profess such abomination as #EndSARS? Why so ungrateful?
Seeehn, there are a lot of things we adults see that if you were to climb Aso rock you wouldn’t be able to get a glimpse of. It brings sadness to our hearts when you guys speak of SARS as if they are a menace. This is a unit that is about 20 years old. We founded and funded it to kill to keep your lives and properties safe from usurpers and invaders. We spent a large sum of money on training our men with state-of-the-art facilities. We spent a lot of resources ensuring we recruited the best men for the job. If not why do you think we made it a requirement that to be a SARS officer you must be an ex-convict?*Is it not to better protect you? Why then do you want us to end it,ehn?
Now to the issues you guys are shouting about. I heard some of you said officers of SARS stop and search you indiscriminately.Ehn ehn? And so what? Don’t you know they are trying to ensure you didn’t forget anything at home? In essence, when they say:
‘Where’s your phone?’ — They only want to ensure you didn’t forget it at home.
‘Unlock your phone.’ — They only want to ensure you remember your password.
‘How much is your account?’ — They only want to ensure you are aware of your bank balance.
‘How come you’re driving a car?’ — They only want to ensure you’re not allowing the luxury of driving get in your way of fitness.
‘You’re using an iPhone?’ — They are only curious about why you prefer IOS to Android.
And so on. That’s all. Nothing more.
The sad thing is just that you youngsters read too many meanings to little things. Take, for instance, those guys that were killed by some SARS officers, do you know whether they tried to kill the SARS officers by pushing them? Do you know whether those guys that died had chased the SARS officers in their sleep with a machete and threatened to kill them? Tell me, if someone chased you to death in your dream and you saw him in real life, what would you do? Would you wait till your dream came true? That’s even on the one hand. On the other hand, how many people have SARS officers killedsef? How many? I bet they’ve only killed less than 30 people. So why so much fuss?
At this juncture, I think it’s important I speak on behalf of the presidency and the police flush, because after we ate chicken peri-peri five days ago, they got infected with oral infection and so cannot talk. You see, we cannot end SARS. We just can’t afford to. They have helped the nation, among other things, to recoverehm what’s his name o…that was kidnapped at ehm…what’s the name of this place o?Yes. That and many similar cases of robbery, kidnapping and fraud. If you ask me, I’d tell you we can’t #endSARS for five reasons.
1. Because we need to keep our officers active by affording them opportunities to practice their training on harassment, sporadic arbitrary shooting, extortion, manipulation, rape, robbery, intimidation, abuse of human rights and so on. After all, it’s an age-long mantra that ‘practice makes perfect’.
2. Because the youths need to understand the importance of giving and sharing. Our officers are out there to teach the Nigerian youngsters on being thy neighbor’s keeper and feeder. I mean if you can afford to look good, you should lend a hand to an officer standing under the sun all day all week.
3. Because we need to instill fear in the youths. Fear is good for a youngster’s heart. Believe me. It helps in stabilizing the heartbeat and in turn, the right flow of blood through the veins. It helps in increasing creativity and innovation. It helps in forestalling acute pneumonia and depression and so on. It is for these reasons that we believe having something to fear daily will keep our youths healthier and happier.
4. Because we need to keep the entire police force relevant and popular. Close your eyes and imagine this. Nigeria without potbellied men and women in black standing by the roadside lazily, their eyes sunken and starved, their guns slung/held like an inferno waiting to burst? What kind of Nigeria is that! We believe the Nigerian Police Flush is an integral thread in the fabric of our nation and the SARS operatives are the active enforcer of NPF’s good image.
5. Finally, we cannot #EndSARS because that
would mean safety and comfort for the youths. No responsible government
provides that. No one ever needs to feel safe and comfortable. Safety and
comfort are injurious to self and national development because as humans, we
can only grow when we are out of our comfort zone.
On a parting note, I want you all to know that we the government of our dear country are ever aware of your plight. We hear you when you wail. It’s just that your clamour has come at a time where there are more pressing issues to handle like finalizing the Hate Speech Bill, and ensuring theozza roomis free from cobwebs and dust.

"Odueso, Olajide, Nzere clinch top spots in 2020 satire prize contest",https://punocracy.com/odueso-olajide-nzere-clinch-top-spots-in-2020-satire-prize-contest/,2020-10-11T09:09:38+01:00,"Oluwatimilehin Odueso, Favour Olajide, and Solomon Nzere have emerged as top entrants in this year’s prize for satire competition organised by Punocracy. Odueso’sHow to raise a true believerwas adjudged the overall best entry by the judges, followed by Olajide’sThe Next Nigerian Leader: A reality TV show, and Nzere’sThe Gospelpreneur — Letter to David.
The trio will be awarded at a ceremony commemorating the World Satire Day set to be held in November alongside thehonorably mentionedentrants in the visual arts category: Fatimah Otukoya and Mujeeb Jummah.
The three winners will be receiving cash prizes of N70,000, N50,000, and N30,000 respectively, as well as certificates and book prizes. And then, candidates in the honorable mentions will each receive a cash prize of N10,000 and certificates.
Here’s what our esteemed judges had to say about the shortlisted entries; they’ve also included their thoughts on satire generally and its significance in political discourse:
I received the entries of a satire competition with great anticipation. Engagement with society and its politics and culture through satire is at the very least a hopeful sign that citizens, especially younger ones, are thinking critically.
The power of this critical engagement becomes more potent as satirists and potential satirists deploy this skill thoughtfully. One thing that is clear to see from the entries is the general grasp of tools like sarcasm, exaggeration, wit and irony which constitute key elements of this genre.
Perhaps a few general points might be in order regarding how, as satirists, we may make our craft more effective in prodding society into introspection and at least triggering debate that interrogates our culture and politics. To write effective satire that goes beyond mild entertainment, it is important not just to capture but to sustain the engagement with one’s potential audience.
Good satire not only ridicules our political failures or cultural foibles, it is also a call to action. For satire to be this call to action, it must avoid things which may distract from this engagement. Poor editing, obvious grammar mistakes and overwrought metaphors, all stand in the way of engagement and more than most genres, satire must be meticulous. Satire can be subtle or brutal, and can use various styles, but it always has a serious concern. It cannot be flippant.  Like a person wielding a weapon, every stroke must be deliberate or one risks harming the wrong person or harming oneself.
“Good satire hits close enough to the mark to get under the skin of the person or institution being criticized.” This can only happen if the work is good enough, not just to capture the interest of its target but to sustain that interest long enough to provoke a reaction.
It is my hope that this competition is only the beginning of a movement to strengthen the skills of persons who undertake this challenging task of public criticism.

—Elnathan John
Satire is the most difficult dialect of the language of art, for good reason. It is a specialism for artists at the top of their game because, in the hands of the satirist, art no longer merely entertains or informs. It is weaponised. Beauty –  that end of all art – is merely the beginning for the skilled satirist, who wields a rapier of wit that can eviscerate his victims. He takes pains to rouse and to channel the mockery of his reader towards the object of his satire. Minor failures of craft, of grammar, of metaphor, of spelling even, invite the reader to laugh at the writer, rather than the subject of his satire. It is the literary equivalent of a swordsman falling upon his own blade.
Satires come with thorns; this is the nature of the art. To be effective, those thorns – be they soft or prickly – must be delivered on roses of distractingly beautiful writing. This speaks to a native balancing act of enchantment and vex. All this to say that the satirist’s anger must be subordinate to, and never overwhelm, his artistry. His literary devices must zing. They should be either novel or burnished, must be neither clunky nor heavy-handed. We the readers are drawn to wit, not to rage. But it is the writer’s superlative wit that gives him licence to rage against society’s failings. In the end, it is beauty – that lightness of touch, that spice shaker of humour and that creative nous of the skilled artist – that seduces us, again and again, to the pages of satire.
This shortlist interrogates nationality and religion (although Christianity appears, for some reason, more lampoonable than Islam). It is concerned with politics, parenthood, and the police. With a finger on society’s pulse, even Covid-19 pays its dues to satire. These writers are close students of life and literature and should accept this calling to an acerbic priesthood that holds her priests to a more exacting standard than her congregation.

SARSically | SARSesquely
The
adverbsSARSicallyandSARSesquelycan both mean ‘in a SARS or
SARSic way’. SARSically specifically means this, and it is more common than
SARSesquely:He was SARSically happy he
almost drank himself to death.SARSesquely is mostly figurative, and not
appropriate for formal discourse:Oh, how
SARSesquely I have fallen for my beloved nation, Nigeria!
Although
SARS has in recent times gained worldwide attention, the word originated from
Nigeria, a country led in turns by lawless, crippled governments. It has its
etymological roots in a ‘special’ group created by one of these crippled
governments. It was created to legalise ‘corporate crime’ and to further
frustrate the country’s youths so as to fully execute its policy of “The
Leaders of Tomorrow are the Same Leaders of Today”, but the youths have
decided enough is enough and have taken the bull by its horns.
Because
of its negative innuendos, successive governments have banned the use of the
word SARS both in public and private places. Retired politicians, to make up
for the pension they are receiving, have been stationed at strategic places to
ensure users of the word are arrested and duly punished. Ghost security cameras
in form of man-controlled mosquitoes have been installed in homes to monitor
people too. Since the #EndSARS advocacies and protests started, at least four
million people have been arrested or shot dead for using the word. If you are
in Nigeria, even though you join the protests, use megaphones to say SARS. That
way, only the megaphones will be arrested and destroyed and you will be safe.
At home, do not mention the word at all!
Sow Anarchy, Reap Sadism (SARS) is responsible for the assaults and killings of thousands of Nigerians in the facade of fighting crime. Protests are ongoing, and everyone is mandated to lend their voice before the youths all become history. You too can join the protests, offline or online.

Marlians don’t follow instructions: A report on Thursday’s #EndSARS protests,https://punocracy.com/marlians-dont-follow-instructions/,2020-10-10T08:10:04+01:00,"By: Chuks .Chinyere(jj)
Ahh, Thursday was not a small day in this country o. I was just getting calls left, right, center from my friends all over about some young Nigerians who have decided to scatter this small country we arekukumanaging. We all know that Nigeria is a far cry of country, that’s not news. But why will some delinquents whose parents have failed to train well, decide that it’s time to end everything?O wrong now.
The first person that called me was Officer Obi o, all the way from Owerri. “Ahh officer obi kilon sup,” I picked up my phone with enthusiasm to hear from my old friend. That’s how this man started vibrating o.
“Can you imagine such rubbish? Just look at small small lif lafs, people I have their mates at home still telling me ‘thank you daddy’ after dinner, talking to me anyhow? They came out o, say they are doing #EndSARS protests. Didn’t they know that public physical protests are a crime in this country? They are only allowed to protest on Twitter, and there is how you will talk too much on Twittersef, DSS will cali you. Or they didn’t hear what happened to Umu El Zalzaky?
“The worst part is, they were all looking like all these yahoo yahoo boys, in this hard nation, person will be carrying handset of four hundredtaaaaaaazeen, if it’s not yahoo yahoo how can they buy dah kain phone?”
“My brother…” he continues. “I came out to tell them to be going to their house o, that front of this my oga office is not where they can come to be making plenty nonsense noise. Could you believe it, these children said they are not going anywhere o. At least if they couldn’t respect my uniform, they were supposed to respect my age na, I senior all of them there, if it was when we were young… well.
“The thing vex me so I brought out my bazooka, I cock it one, e did not cock, I cock it two, then I remembered that there was no bullet inside; it’s God that save them that day. But lemme not lie, even if I had bullets inside, I wouldn’t have killed anyone, this country is too hard for people to die, if one person dienaw, who will they give their problems, everybody should stay alive and carry their crossbiko.”
“Officer Obi, lemme advise youeh, next time do you know what you’ll do? Seeeh, hello… hello, are you there? Ohh, he’s credit has finished.”
I am tired, why will everyone be so angry in one day. Even celebrities that have money are protesting, what are they complaining about? At least they have money to buy fuel if NEPA no give them light, it’s not like SARS can stop to harass Runtown or Falz, or P-Square; is 2020 not bad enough? Just imagine people doing public protests.
Wait o, Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly is calling me.
“Ahhh, baba mi Obasa Basa, the only man EFCC can chase but cannot catch, Jagaban’s houseboy, it’s not easy baba mi. How are you, sir?”
“Ehhhhh, what is that your name again, see listen, today is not the day, today is the wrongest day to come back to my house — sorry, the State House of Assembly — after a gruesome day of negotiations with the members of the EFCC over proceeds of a business deal, only to find jobless and useless children at my door trying to start a camp fire. This is wrongnaw. Has house rent in Lagos become so expensive? Don’t they have parents? I told the policemen to dismantle their tents and take away their chairs, yet they won’t go; they want to waithiyyaatill morning so that other jobless lazy ones like them can come and join them to protest for what? #EndSARS?
“If you’re not an armed robber why will you be afraid of SARS, I have lived in Lagos for over 30 years and SARS has not harassed me one day, why will they be moving around with big big phones as young as they are; where did they get the money? Anyway, I’m going out to speak to them, because I need some sleep; we have final negotiations with EFCC scheduled for tomorrow and we need to get that over with so that I can focus on Baba’s 2023 campaign. Ehhh, meanwhile help me contact omo Naira Marleyyen, he was supposed to ‘contwol the crowd’, he needs to explain why all these Marlians are all over the place protesting #EndSARS.”
So I picked up the phone and rang Naira Marley ASAP like rwoky. “Ehh-lowe, Marley Naira above the line, ma4.”
“Bro, I thought you called of the protests after your discussions with the Police, why are your Marlians all over the place?”
“Marlians don’t follow instructions,” he replied and ended the call. Apparently, he was busier with his Insta-story.
Nigerian youths are lazy they said; too lazy to stand and fight, take what is theirs. Well, see us now, we are in every city, in every state, being peaceful and violent, giving them thegbasandgbos, light and heavyweight.
We are taking matters into our own hands, because a failed state will be ours to bear, years after the oldies are not here.
I saw Runi; I heard Marcaroni; posterity will know you. I saw you, I heard you, fighting for your children born and unborn. Posterity will never forget you.
EndSARS is only an opportunity to #EndImpunity, #DontStop."
Police brutalise protesters protesting police brutality,https://punocracy.com/police-brutalise-protesters-protesting-police-brutality/,2020-10-10T08:09:55+01:00,"NIGERIA (The T.A. Report)― Police officers in Nigeria, famously ranked as the worst all over the world, have thrown decency to the wind as they descend on protesters across the country who are calling for an end to police brutality.
Protesters calling for an end to the Special Advanced Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police have continually trooped to the streets since Thursday. But, feeling threatened by the wave of demonstration, members of the force spared no rod (or cartridge) in re-establishing their dominance.
The police spokesperson, Francis Ndo, acting against the better judgment of his long line of lecturers, justified this reaction by suggesting confidently but without a shred of proof that many of the protesters are themselves crooks and clout-chasers.
The president and the Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Aaniridamu, have been taking HD pictures at the state house and sharing them via Twitter to show their concern. They have, in fact, also released statements emphasising that they are on top of the situation and SARS will soon be reformed and everything will be right and, most importantly, everyone can go home.
Insiders, however, informed The T.A. Report that the government is dragging its feet in order to make extra revenue through the police tactical squad before something tangible is done.
“This protest is making everybody to panic o,” one source at the presidential villa said.
“You know the only other protest to have received such international recognition is the #BringBackOurGirls movement. But the truth is we cannot scrap SARS now because we have not reached our revenue generation goals for the last quarter of 2020 so we are trying to fast-track things or at least attain 50 per cent completion. It is this money we still use to fund campaigns during election, buy fuel to sustain police stations, and pay for some of our unofficial trips abroad. Nigerians who have had encounters with SARS have no idea how important their contributions are to national development.”
Meanwhile, rumours have it that many local media organisations are so dumbfounded by this strange turn of events they are still at wits’ end on how to go about reporting them. For now, silence remains the best answer, the executives have hammered (into the heads of reporters who still want their jobs).

We have your best interests in mind,https://punocracy.com/we-have-your-best-interests-in-mind/,2020-10-01T07:59:12+01:00,"By: Ibrahim Williams
May dissension never blossom in our hearts.
Amen.
My dearest friends and countrymen, words have reached me that a lot of you are planning to support a mass rally against we the politicos and messiahs of our beloved country.Haba!Is this right for us? Aren’t you aware that there are a lot of good plans we have in store for you?Ahn Ahn!Instead of you to walk down to our offices or call our phones, which we always answer as soon as they ring, you are…you are busy cooking up revolutions here and there. It is wrong,ehn. It is wrong. Anyway, since it’s our country’s IN-dependence day, I think it’s high time I revealed some of our plans to you.
1. To give Boko Haram a country of their own
I’m sure this doesn’t sound strange to you. Of course, it shouldn’t! We are all aware of the menace of this maniacal group of innocent God-loving criminals who lie and pretend to kill in His name rather than the name of their original god. Well, we, alongside Lieutenant General Two-Kor Luratai mapped out a geographic plan. We shall give unto Cesar what Cesar wants, and keep for Nigerians what is left. I don’t want to go about justifying this right decision. I just want you all to know that this is an ongoing plan. It might, however, hasten up following the repeated attacks on Gov. Gana Zoomloom of Bornu state.
2. To wreck start-up businesses and SMEs
Indeed, extreme situations require extreme measures. This is why we have in our proposed blueprint, the pressing need to run-down small business. Pay attention now. You see, we evaluated the damage the pandemic caused Nigeria, and believe me, it was ocean-deep. This damage, we noticed, was most pronounced on start-ups and SMEs. It for this reason that we felt the need to separate the wheat from the chaff. But we are not wicked people. Believe me. We also plan to give the small and medium businesses the chance to take their own decision. On our part, we plan to make life miserable for them by enforcing regulations and extortionate dues. On their part, they can either choose to obey and pay or close down their business. This, we believe, is best for our ailing economy.
3. To invest in other countries
You see in this life, if one keeps facing one direction, one will always only see one thing. Nigeria has faced one direction since 1914. And it is time to change that. We plan to turn our national eyes toward other countries. Our own problems are old enough to fend for themselves now. As the eldest brother of all African countries, we shall strive for peace in Mali and forget our North-East states andSouthern Kaduna. We shall promote trade links between Nigeria and Niger, and ignore our ineffective railroad trade lines in the West and the East of the country. Let’s face it, what do we need railways for in Nigeria, after all? We shall continue to promise the African Union our unflinching support to contribute to this country and that, while we ignore our Aso-rock size of debts. Remember, the bible said, “Love your neighbour more than yourself.”
4. To recruit more sacrificial lambs for the Nigerian Army
You must have heard when we informed Nigerians about our ongoing recruitment into the army. Well, that I must say is one of our plans to reduce unemployment and maybe our overpopulation too. In the past 10 years of our battle with insurgency and banditry, all around the country, Nigeria has lost many men in the front line. Therefore, as a responsible government, we are willing and ready to lose more men untilvictoriaisascerta!
We believe there is strength in huge numbers irrespective of the fatal potency of our enemy’s collection of the latest arsenal. We believe the battle cry of a thousand men is strong enough to hush the ordnance weapons used by these insurgents. If we didn’t believe this, would this nonsense bespoke Boko Haram not have killed Governor Zoomloom in their last attack? And the one before that one? And the one before that? You see? Besides, we need more deaths. More deaths mean more military burials. More military burials mean more cash … I’m sure you understand.
5. To increase the dosage of suffering the masses enjoy
As a compassionate and generous politico and ruling elite, we have compiled a list of ways to enrich the suffering of our beloved masses. My friends and countrymen, you’d agree with me when I say God created some of us with many and many others with little. It is this same God, you’d agree, that encouraged those He gave many to give those with little. For this reason, we have decided to give more to the masses. We plan to give them more reasons to lament, cry, and maybe … kick the bucket.
We plan to increase the amount of levies, fines, electricity bills, fuel, custom charge, clearance charge, export and import charge, land use charge, VAT, income tax, capital gain tax, education tax, lease agreement tax, mortgage tax, dividends tax, royalty tax, building and construction tax, breathing tax, citizenship tax, walking tax, sweating tax, eating tax, laughing tax, crying tax, toilet tax, copulation tax, breathing tax and even suffering tax. Please do not be awestruck! We made our findings prior. We found out that suffering is good for Nigerians, and it helps the masses avoid TB, obesity, HBP, cancer, Covid-19 and other rich men disease.
At this juncture, my dear friends and countrymen, do you still think we don’t have your best interests at heart? Why the proposed protest then?Ehn?"
Nigeria: Sixty but [not] faulty,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-sixty-but-not-faulty/,2020-10-01T07:22:12+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Nigerians have every reason to be thankful for this special occasion. Only an ingrate will have no justification to give thanks on behalf of our dear country. I mean, since our fiftieth anniversary in 2010, God has preserved your life and eyes to see six ASUU strikes, three NLC strikes, devaluation of the naira from 156/$, a surge in importation of talents from Nigeria to oversea, a mushrooming population of poor people, thus, making us the world’s poverty capital, a proliferated unemployment rate, a surge in mortality rates due to insecurity, a country as united as the blades of a ceiling fan, and many undeniable glories of selfish and poor leadership. We must give accolades to sixty years of leadership with vision.
On top of all this, more Nigerians have been lifted out of poverty (into the grave) since our fiftieth anniversary. You have every reason to be grateful. You have every rationale to rejoice that you carry the green passport. In 2010, the largest tribe in the nation was the ‘poor people’ tribe, it is still the same ten years after. Talk about consistency! In 2010, we were making efforts to annihilate Boko Haram, but now, we have spiced it up with banditry, armed herdsmen, SARS and mysterious abductions. For only incompetent and selfish leadership can do these things, let us give it the praise it deserves on this grand occasion.
Whoever says Nigeria is faulty at sixty must be a clown talking out of anger, hinged on exclusion from the share of the national cake. There is more than enough evidence to show that Nigeria is as fit as a fiddle. In case you’re too blind to see the giant strides the nation is making, ask any member of the ruling APC, they’ll show you. They have the customised lens to clearly see the achievements of their principal. I’m still amazed at how they’re the only one that can spot it. Perhaps, more than 100 million Nigerians have eyes but cannot see.
As we celebrate a prosperous Nigeria today, let us not forget to relish the enormous dividend of democracy her citizens have enjoyed since 1960. These dividends have motivated the masses to continually lend a helping hand to their hardworking leaders in numerous ways. Nigerians happily fuel their generator to relieve the National Power Grid from stress, they dig their own water supply to decrease the pressure on the water pipes running through their houses, they donate money out of their 30k minimum wage to repair their bad roads so they can ease the government of that headache. You know, the government has too much to do with limited funds. And it’s not about what your country can do for you, it’s about what you can do for your country.
Sometimes, Nigerians even sleep with one eye opened or employ a security guard to keep watch over them while they sleep because the police and security agencies have to be stationed at big men and politicians’ houses as the constitution requires. All these gestures to help are from a thankful heart. The government has done so much for them, so, they have to give back in many ways as a show of appreciation.
Nigeria, as a country, redefined what independence means in Africa. So, let’s end with some traits of an independent nation. First, an independent nation must need foreign intervention or threats to conduct a free and fair election. An independent nation must have its citizens troop out in their numbers overseas due to its working systems. An independent nation must call on able-bodied citizens to abandon mechanised farming for small-scale farming. Presidents of independent nations must spend more time overseas than in their country. Independent nations must make much noise without actions. They must talk more than they do.
As for the long-suffering citizens of Nigeria, they don’t have to retrace their steps to a new nation. They must keep celebrating independence annually without a substance to be proud of. It’s a good bargain to exchange four years for a few cups of rice, beans and suffering. Also, as a good citizen of Nigeria, use your eyes and hands to vote incompetent leaders. Then, organise a fasting and prayer programme, for the heavens to be opened on the incompetent leaders you elected, to be baptised with competence. Do you hear it? Lastly, use Nigeria as a point of contact in your prayers, that your life and endeavors are as prosperous as Nigeria when you’re sixty years old. If you’re above sixty, use your children."
Exclusive: Why Hail-Rufai has yet to appoint a new Agom-Adara,https://punocracy.com/why-hail-rufai-yet-to-appoint-new-agom-adara/,2020-09-30T08:55:34+01:00,"It is no longer news that in Kaduna State two
traditional stools have found themselves in a situation known in Latin as asede
vacante– an expression that means a position of authority is without an
incumbent.
The first incident that rendered a traditional seat vacant in the state was the transition to the realm of the ancestors by the paramount ruler of the Adara Chiefdom of the Southern Kaduna sub-region – HRH Dr. Maiwada Raphael Galadima (Agom Adara III). Reports have it that he met his inevitable “ultimate-end” while returning from a meeting with His Excellency, the Executive Governor of the state, via the hands of kidnappers. Similarly, of recent the Almighty in His wisdom deemed it fit to call HRH Shehu Idris, the Emir of Zazzau, to receive eternal reward in the bliss of Al-jannah. My heartfelt condolence goes to all Nigerians, especially the people of Adara Chiefdom and the Zazzau Emirate.
Upon
the death of HRH Shehu Idris, the governor took to his various social media
platforms to express his grief over the demise of the late monarch. El-rufa’i,
going by the evidence of his posts on Facebook, is not taking the matter of the
appointment of a new emir with any iota of levity on his part. He has camped
himself in the Kaduna Archives, studying the history of Zazzau, selection
process of emirs and the leadership principles laid down by the founding
fathers of the Sokoto Caliphate. It is expected that before the year runs out,
another illustrious son of Zazzau would be placed on the throne of his
forebears to the glory of Allah (SWA).
The diligent act of Mallam has earned him the opposite of the credit he deserves by social media vuvzuzelas — with the noise more prominent among people of Southern Kaduna extraction. The crux of their dissatisfaction is that nearly two years after the demise of the late head of the Adara Traditional State, His Excellency has yet to appoint another worthy son of Adara land to sit on the seat of his ancestors.
The Kaduna State Government, per the then Special Assistant to the governor, spoke glowingly of Maiwada, who they described as “a man of peace, a traditional ruler who consistently made positive contributions for the peace and tranquillity of his Chiefdom and the entire State.” The death of such an ideal individual and a leader par excellence is no usual event. It was of the death of his kind that Shakespeare pontificated that the heavens blaze forth in agony.
His burial, as witnessed by people of this age was not a regular one; it brought the world to the little-known town of Kachia. In similar vein, the appointment of his successor should not be in a rapid and haphazard manner. The delay in naming a successor is a deliberate ploy to honour the late ruler and to get people not to forget him in a hurry. Since he was unable to make the heavens blaze at his death, the governor must do all he can to, at least, keep his memory and legacy evergreen. Moreover, the continued vacancy in the royal house will serve as a reminder to the people of how their chief was abducted and used for shooting practice by his abductors with neither provocation nor lawful justification. Is there any better way to keep his memories evergreen than this? This accounts for the delay they are experiencing in the appointment of a successor.
Sources close to the government, informed me that being from the area himself, His Excellency does not want to rush the appointment of a new leader that will provoke the gods of the land to visit the land of his ancestors with a ruthless genre of madness that makes people to take arms against another as it happened constantly during the reign of a particular Agom Adara. Considering the importance of the task placed on him, he deemed it necessary to go beyond the study of literature — as he is doing in the Zazzau case at the moment — in reaching the most important decision on whose buttocks the stool fits perfectly. Since the death of the monarch, he has been engaging the oracles, priests, witches andvillage-peopleof the land in a series of fruitful deliberations to determine the next monarch.
I am
baffled by the queries raised over Hail-rufai’s delay in appointing a new head
for the Adara people. We tend to forget so soon that he is the governor. He is
slightly taller than the law, as he has proven several times and we have seen
from some of his actions and inactions. He has the license to do as he pleases
without anyone questioning the exercise of his discretions, even in matters
that adversely affect the welfare of the people. I hold as an immutable truth
that the governor can do no wrong. He is Hail-Rufai, he can choose to enthrone
and refuse to enthrone.Who wan try Mai-rusau?
It is true and in tandem with the notion of equality that, “What is good for the goose is good for the gander”, but it is also true that “the patient dog eats the juiciest bone”. While it is not too out of place for the people of Adara Chiefdom to demand that the matter of the appointment of a leader for their revered traditional institution be treated as a matter of urgency as it is being done to the Zazzau Emirate, they should also understand that His Excellency is doing everything within his powers to appoint a leader after his own heart.
To
the people of Adara Chiefdom, I like to say, “learn to be calming down” and
also learn to trust Gwamna Hail-Rufai. He has never failed, he will never fail,
and he will do what he says he will do. It is scriptural that they that wait
upon their lord shall renew their strength; shall run and not be weary; they
shall mount up with wings like an eagle; they shall walk and not faint."
“I have never received bribe all my life” — Ameshi to sue Magun for plagiarism,https://punocracy.com/ameshi-to-sue-magun-for-plagiarism/,2020-09-26T07:39:18+01:00,"By: Machiavelli
Information just reaching me is that the the Minister of Wakabout, Mr Ameshi, is putting final preparations to nail the embattled former EFCC chief, Mr Magun, for plagiarism.
From my sources close to the Honorable Minister, I can authoritatively tell you that when news broke out Wednesday that Mr. Magunuttered wordsduring a meeting with the press on never receiving a bribe in his life, the honorable minister was left flabbergasted, utterly astonished, and vowed to fight like every struggling Nigerian out there to protect his verbal properties.
Recall that the ever gallant Minister and former governor from the south a few years back hadsaid during an interviewwhen asked about corruption:
“…I have never recieved bribe in all my life, I don’t like money.”
The reaction from Nigerians was positive, most of them stating that such an assertion from a public office holder deserves cheers and not jeers. Indeed, these saintly words are known nationwide as one of the major reasons Ameshi is still holding down the fort in his ministerial position. Toeing the path of Nigerians who brought back a very successful leader in the 80s to lead them again, the minister has brought back locomotives from the 80s for us in 2020. The older the better, right? All done without taking a bribe in a country where giving bribes is as common as drinking sachet water and throwing the empty sachets into the gutter.
In spite of all these developments, one is left in limbo as to how the former EFCC Chief, Mr. Magun, will have the temerity to throw the same line at Nigerians as a form of defence even after both his hands were caught deep inside the cookie jar of recovered funds.
The We No Go Gree Group (WNGGG), a non-political social group consisting of youths aged 55 and under, have long began the process of protesting the flagrant act of plagiarism with no acknowledgement to the first and original speaker. My colleague, Gunter Glick, who interviewed the 49-year-old president of the group, Mr. Easy Yammu, was told the group was tired of names of public holders being thrown into the mud after they had worked hard to attain these lofty positions for themselves.
The ever versatile, pragmatic and conscious youths however need to hold their peace, as the honourable minister has already decided to head to court for appeasement. If Mr. Magun thinks his days in court will soon be over, he better have a rethink as the honourable minister is looking to sue for a rumoured amount of N100 million. If you ask me that’s chicken change compared to what the former EFCC chairman allegedly embezzled.
Alternatively, Mr. Magun has until Monday next week to retract the statement or acknowledge the original author whilst exploring an out-of-court settlement.
Asked why he will resort to such a heavy sum in the sue plea, Mr. Ameshi told our correspondent that he will reiterate what he said years back about not receiving bribes. As such the money will come in handy to sort out his rising bills and expenditure, which he has been unable to meet up with due to his hatred for bribes and kickbacks. It’s also his belief that this will serve as a deterrent to others who are fond of using people’s works without proper reference.
Meanwhile, it is sad that the subtle art of fainting as a form of defence by public officials was not patented by the first fainter, Old Isa May II. The result has been it’s abuse by public office holders like one Pondeiing who carried out fainting acts based on poor scripts, poor acting, and without an iota of finesse.

#OurMilitaryIsCapable: Army takes war on terror to Twitter bandits,https://punocracy.com/ourmilitaryiscapable/,2020-09-23T09:01:38+01:00,"TWITTER (The T.A. Report)―  The Nigerian Army has stepped up its investments in Twitter hash tags after realising that the war of terrorism cannot be won without absolute victory on social media.
According to sources familiar with the project, this new exercise has been code-namedOperation Lafiya Twitter, and will likely gulp close to a billion naira in funding.
Leading thisassault on social media banditsis Brig. Gen. PamPam, more fondly known by his nickname Omo Iya Ologi. With an army of over 260,000 followers on Twitter, Iya Ologi’s son possesses the perfect qualities required for a project as important as ass-wiping the Nigerian Army’s reputation on the internet.
“Nigeria is currently ranked the third most terrorised country on the planet. From Biko Haram [sic] to Banditory [double sic] to Herdsmen to Kidnappings terrorism is a problem in Nigeria,” he said from one side of his mouth before proceeding to add “#OurMilitaryisCapable” from the second side, all the while wearing a straight face.
Though the Nigerian Army has been one of the greatest advocates against parody accounts on the platform, it appears they have no reservations working with them when it is in the interest of national security.
One account on Twitter pretending to be Omah Lay, a popular musician, under the guise of parody, is another leading commander under Operation Lafiya Twitter.
Heaskedusers of the platform, yesterday, to drop the name of their banks while adding the hashtag#OurMilitaryIsCapableto their replies. 150 people (?) swiftly commented, most without including their account numbers but somehow still expecting the god of giveaways to locate them.
Meanwhile, just less than a week ago, the same Omah Lay could be seen on the platform asking to get a free meal of burger, chips, and Cocacola from Parpkin Shawarma, and begging his followers not to engage his retweet (as this was the condition for winning).
The T.A. Report understands that the money for Operation Lafiya Twitter was only approved following the total defeat of Boko Haram terrorists, bandits, and kidnappers, and the acquisition of more than enough arms and ammunition for officials of the Armed Forces. We have also confirmed, glory to God, that recent videos that showed soldiers in the North East drinking unclean water and crying for support from the army leadership were either fabricated by the opposition party or originated from the Republics of Niger and Chad.

Nigerians’ letter to daddy and mummy,https://punocracy.com/nigerians-letter-to-daddy-and-mummy/,2020-09-23T08:20:16+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
On behalf of every Nigerian, we want to say thank you to our Daddy and Mummy—UK and US—on whose shoulder we will always stand until we’re old enough to be truly independent. It’s not that we’re that reckless to get out acts together, we are just being subservient to our father and mother. Only a bastard child will not heed to his parents’ instructions. Nigeria will never be one.
Daddy and Mummy, without you, where will our president get adequate care for his health? Without you where will our politicians who have created a functional society for their constituents run to when water pass garri here? Daddy without you, and sometimes your friends in the UAE, where our leaders go to spend their money? Mummy, if you didn’t work so hard on your educational system, where will children of the influential study? You have done so much for us, we cannot tell it all. Once have you called, thrice have we answered. Who born monkey!
Mummy, when we fought so hard to quit sucking your breast in 1960, we didn’t realise it came with so many responsibilities. We thought it would be a walk in the park and our cargo cult mentality will cause our lands to flow with milk and honey. We hastily stole our freedom not knowing that it came with great responsibility. Mummy, those were the mistakes you made. You set us free physically, allowed us to run off in amazement, but you didn’t tell us we needed to be mentally free too. Now we are in such an abusive relationship with our leaders so much so that without your intervention they cannot sit up.
Daddy, amidst all these, we want to know how you do the things you do. Why do our leaders fear you so much? Are your hospitals, schools, security, and health care that sweet and functional that they can’t deprive themselves of them? We’re just wondering. For example, we cried like bushbabies for months for the release of an activist, Omoyele Sowore, after several court orders to release him. But our government, who should be an example to us, refused to obey the court orders until a letter came from Congress. Only six signatures from the US swept through Aso Rock with fear leading to the reluctant release of Mr Sowore.
Daddy, we also want to thank you for your recent and timely intervention in the Edo elections. If not that you said you were watching and will ban election riggers from sucking from your feeding bottle, how would the election have been? It was your instruction that contributed to ensuring the will of the people prevailed.
Daddy and Mummy, the only lesson we could pick from this masochistic union you put us in with our leaders is that a pleasantly abusive and adorably irresponsible husband that’s receptive to his daddy and mummy is better than the one that beats up the wife but cannot be cautioned by daddy and mummy. We now know where to run to when we want our leaders to sit up.
Above all, we thank God that it’s not a shameful thing in any way that a sixty-year-old man still takes orders from his parents on how to run his family. What an obedient sixty-year-old! Daddy and Mummy, we need you now, more than ever. We need you more, especially as the 2023 presidential election approaches. Collect your feeding bottle from their mouth so that our leaders can act accordingly."
How to gain the ‘yahoo boy’ tag,https://punocracy.com/how-to-gain-the-yahoo-boy-tag/,2020-09-21T08:52:20+01:00,"By: Zenas Ubere
If you are a young man, fairly successful, and you want to be tagged as a yahoo boy, here is how to do it.
1.
You have to identify as Nigerian. Nigerian Prince is
not synonymous with internet fraud for no reason. Internet fraud is a divine
talent that mostly Nigerian young men can display. If you think it is a lie,
remember what happened in 2019, when the US authorities announced charges
against 80 people for an internet scam and money laundering of over $46
million. Weren’t 77 of the indicted people Nigerians? We have the volume
because we are better at this fraud thing. It does not matter that the biggest
fraud in US history was executed by a white man, where he amassed $65 billion
from a Ponzi Scheme. Nigerians, nonetheless, remain the greatest when it comes
to fraud. So, be Nigerian.
2.
Now that you have chosen the right nationality, you
have to be of an appropriate age. I will advise that you be in your 20s. I am
not implying that those above 20s do not qualify to gain this honourable tag.
It is just that the younger you are, the better. Advanced men who look plump
(especially with a pot belly) and married do not fit into the yahoo boy image.
Even though, in the secrecy of their chambers, some of them conjure money out
of foreign bank accounts with miraculous powers. Yahoo boys are always young
and single. Go young or go home.
3.
My people say that a man who goes to the farm without
his cutlass went for sight-seeing. And a cutlass is to a farmer what a laptop
is to a yahoo boy. Therefore, you have to own a laptop. It could be that you
use it for web or graphic design jobs, or you just use it to stream movies and
HD porn. Just own a laptop. And when you’ve got one, you may want to use it in
public places, like cafes and restaurants. And because being nosy is a love
language in Nigeria, one curious fellow would walk past you, draw backwards and
poke his gaze into your laptop screen, asking, “Na webmail be this?”
You may not understand what he means but, worry not,
you’ve just been marked as a yahoo boy. Even though it may seem unlikely that
an actual yahoo boy would be as careless as displaying his God-given talent in
public places, putting himself at the risk of an arrest.
4.
Please do well to note that you have to wear good
clothes, clothes that announce you have enough money in your bank account. Wear
designers. Wear Givenchy, Gucci, Fendi and every other trendy fashion. And if
jewellery is your thing, go for gold. I know this phrase may sound like a Gold
Circle advert, but I mean it. Go for gold. Nothing announces
flamboyant-yahoo-boy like a gold necklace, a gold wristwatch and an ear stud.
Come out in glitters.
No matter how tempting it gets, even if your village
people are controlling you through a mirror festooned with feathers, resist
them and do not wear suits. One, because the Nigerian weather is too hot for a
suit. And two, because you are not trying to look like aspire-to-perspire
businessmen. Neither are you trying to appear on Forbes Africa 30-Under-30.
Neither are you trying to look like a pastor with a booming chain of churches.
You are merely trying to be labelled as a yahoo boy. Dress as you want to be
addressed.
God forbid that you come out in agbada and caftan and
hope to be marked as a fraudster. The image does not fit. You are not trying to
look like a politician. We all know politicians to be honest people, a set of
people that are never associated with fraud. Stick to the maraphacken
designers.
5.
Most days, stay at home and always have electricity.
And because you are Nigerian, one of the bulbs outside your apartment would
always be turned on; therefore, your neighbours would notice that you always
have power supply. It could be possible that you are a freelancer working from
home, or a software developer with a remote job, but this does not matter. Give
it a week and a concerned neighbour will say, “That guy de always get
light. E go be yahoo boy.”
One of the advantages of being tagged a yahoo boy by
your neighbours is this: You will earn the admiration of those who praised the
yahoo boys for keeping Nigeria’s economy afloat during the recession.
6.
If you can, buy a car. Something that complements your
size and doesn’t steal the attention away from you. Preferably, go for a small
salon, like the Toyota Avalon, a car befitting your youthful status. And with a
befitting car, you will get enough police and SARS attention. What’s a yahoo
boy without police and SARS attention?
7.
You have to know that when the police and SARS men
notice your glitter, they will make advances at you. It is not like they are
into you and want to sleep with you or something. They just want your money.
Talk of Jezebels and Delilahs in Force clothing.
They will come at you with strong advances, touching
your body and pretending to search you without a warrant or mutual consent.
Brace yourself for this search because they could, in the process of this
activity, mistakenly or deliberately, touch your buttocks and your balls. This
could tingle your skin but do not budge. You are being tagged a yahoo boy and
that is your reward.
Furthermore, they will go through your phone and laptop, prying through old chats and emails. And if by the special grace of God, you had used the word “client” in any of your messages, then your tag would shine brighter than your gold necklace. The police and SARS men will caress your pocket and romance your bank account, taking as much cash as they can, and you will ejaculate all they can stroke from you because you have earned the yahoo boy tag, and some things come at a price.

Masterclass: How to become a Nigerian society,https://punocracy.com/masterclass-how-to-become-a-nigerian-society/,2020-09-21T08:35:19+01:00,"By: Uchenna Emelife
We like to tell ourselves that Nigeria is a
beautiful country. This is notwithstanding the deaths, kidnappings, robberies,
terrorist attacks, fraud that take place almost on a daily basis. We insist on
using ‘beautiful’ as though the glaring blemishes are simply beauty marks. What
I particularly love about Nigeria however, is her people. They are exceptional
in many ways. So if you’re interested in learning how to fully become part of a
Nigerian society or you have doubts as to the kind of Nigerian society you’re already
part of, you are in luck. I’m
here for you.
The Nigerian Society (NS) can be classified into
two:
1. The Average Nigerian Society (ANS)
2. The Woke Nigerian Society (WNS)
The ANS is made up of Nigerians who are highly
conservative. They are hostile to everything that may seem Western except
religion, even though the same westernisation brought the very religion they
revere. They have very little exposure, may be educated but not exposed. They
find several platforms of exposure like movies, books, social media a
distraction and would rather hold on to their beliefs and their Pastors’.
Want to become part of an ANS? Here are some easy
steps:
What
To Do When You Hear of Rape
As an aspiring member of ANS, you must meet a rape
news with an already formed conviction that whoever got raped brought it upon
themselves. If it’s a woman, oh! It is your lucky day, an avenue to preach the
Gospel. So before inquiring further details, demand that your questions be
answered. These should be your questions:
What
was she wearing?
Important question. No one who is fully clad can be
raped or attract a rapist. After all, there has never been any rape victim who
was raped while in a decent dress. You must say this part with full confidence.
Stand on it and don’t let any body shame you with things like “You’re
making a case for rapists,” so what if you are? The way some ladies
dress with their bodies exposed, it is deserving they get raped even.
Some people will attack you with news of kids being
raped and decently dressed ladies too. But I’m here to teach you how to
clapback. Revert with more questions like:
Why
Were They Walking Alone at Night?
You throw this one when the indecent dressing
fails. Remember you have one mission which is to justify the rape, so you must
never leave any loophole. When the said victim is fully clad and still got
raped, then there must have been walking alone at night. If true, then what
were they expecting? Why would a woman who is so weak and should rely on a man
for security walk alone at night when they are not asking to be raped? You’ve
to put this question out with a straight face. It is philosophical, wait till
it sinks in. If it looks like they don’t still get it, remind them that God in
His wisdom created Eve for Adam so they could walk together. Drop the mic after
this. You don finish talk.
Have
you seen kids these days?
For real, have they seen? Why are they trying so
hard to exonerate the victim? Didn’t the Bible say that heaven helps those who
help themselves? These people don’t help themselves, that’s why they get raped.
Back to your question. Tell them that parents in
the way they style their children offer them to be raped. And some of these
kids stubbornly mature faster than normal. If they never wanted to be raped,
maybe they would have never allowed their chests and buttocks protrude early
and their parents would have dressed them more decently.
What
To Do When You Hear of Suicide
God forbid! Yes. That should be your first
reaction. It is only a coward that would kill themselves. If only they prayed
harder and believed in God, their situation would have been resolved. After
airing this, you move on to the comparisons.
As an aspiring member of ANS, you must be good with
putting others in your shoes, even when you don’t know what they’re passing
through. Believe that your situation is worse and if you could survive it, then
anyone can survive anything. So say things like:
“Look
at him. He is even in first class. Me that lost my Dad when I was in UG 1 and I
had to repeat the whole year, did I kill myself? He is just a big fool.”
Especially when the said suicidal person is still contemplating
suicide, but if they have already died by it, the condemnation stage begins:
“He
will rot in hell. Bloody fool. Suicide is a sin. Ah! That’s how somebody used
his own hand and enter hell fire.”
Never ever try to be logical or attempt to understand.
That’s the devil trying to fool you into thinking that it’s okay to commit
suicide. Suicide should never be an option.
How To
React To the News of a Homophobic Attack
Someone is already doing God’s work, so you must be
glad. Say things like, “Serves them right. They deserve to die.”
Ignore that love which religion advises you
to show. A homosexual can never
be your neighbor so they don’t deserve your love. Gay people are why the world
is as it is now. It is not corruption or crime or racism as the media is
painting, it is homosexuals. They are the cause of Coronavirus. Believe this,
profess this. And when you see the photo of a loved-up homosexual couple, you
have to talk about their sex life with such obsession that it could be mistaken
that you long for it. If you are a guy, ask,“How can another guy put
his dick in my ass?” even though no one ever offered to. You watch and
enjoy gay porn. Ehen, so what? That one is different na. It’s just acting.
Do these and in no time, the ANS badge is yours.
The WNS is further divided into two:
1. Religious Woke Nigerian Society (RWNS)
2. Irreligious Woke Nigerian Society (IWNS)
Members of the RWNS and IWNS are Nigerians who are
educated, exposed and very progressive. The RWNS however is still religious.
They visit their various worship places but struggle with some religious ideas.
Christians who belong to this category would rather than tithe, give the money
to a beggar. Empathetic, they try not to judge or condemn people. Except when
you don’t fit into their freethinking.
While the IWNS is made up of atheists, agnostics,
persons who are indifferent to a religion and God. They are everything the RWNS
is, except they are more liberal.
What
To Do When You Hear of Rape
As an aspiring member of the WNS, you can react to
a rape news in two ways, depending on the kind of woke you are. Emotional woke?
Or faux-intellectual woke? If you want to be the former, you have to stand with
the victim’s statement always. As an emotional WNS, you either start a GoFundMe
account for the victim if she needs it, or you launch a cancel campaign of the
rapist especially if he is well known. Notice my usage of pronouns? That’s what
you must agree with. The victim is always female and right, and the rapist is
always male and should rot.
As for the faux-intellectual WNS, you’re an
automatic balancer. When a lady talks about how she was raped, meet it with
“Even boys get raped too”. You must clamour for equal sentence to be
given to a false rape accuser in the event of them lying.
This applies to both members of the RWNS and IWNS.
What
To Do When You Hear of Suicide
Write beautiful articles
about how important it is to reach out to loved ones always. Whether or not you
actually do it, doesn’t matter. Just write sweet articles and after earning
4000 retweets, go about your normal life until the next suicide. Unlike the
ANS, the RWNS doesn’t condemn or judge the victim. So, say things like,“I pray you find the calm the world couldn’t
offer you.”This bit isn’t necessary if you aspire to the IWNS.
How To
React To the News of a Homophobic Attack
This is so ungodly. You must blurt out as a member
of the RWNS. You are to stand by the ‘live and let live‘ rule and be
embittered by the remarks of the ANS that gloat over the victims of the attack.
Leave judgement and condemnation to God is the code you should leave by.
If you aspire to the IWNS however, you should not
be as subtle. You must insult God, religion, Christians, Muslims, and blame
them for homophobia. Bring in your personal loathe for Nigerian pastors into
it, whether it adds up or not. Isn’t religion the opium of the society after
all?

5 Sacred Truths for the Prospective Ultimate Nigerian
Politician
I am Olawale Godwin Esq., a graduate of the
prestigious Harvard Law School and an established arbitrator and human-rights
lawyer. My passion for the equality of all humans is what has driven me to
embark on a political career. I heard you helped the likes of Furosident
Mohammadum Mbuhari, General Sani Abasha (of blessed memory) and Asiwaju Hamid
Tinu Ibu attain the status of ultimate Nigerian politicans. I need you to help
me too; the road seems rough and winding.
Thanks in advance,
Olawale Godwin, Esq.
Dear Olawale Godwin Esq.,
It is a good thing that you made the wise choice of
reaching out to me before embarking on your political career. You see, many a
well-meaning Nigerian delved into Nigerian politics without full consultations
with people who have spent years studyingpolitricksin Nigeria – and it ended in tears for them. Thank you for contacting me,
learned Olawale Godwin. There are indeed some truths that the prospective
ultimate Nigerian politician must know – for the Nigerian politician who would
not be guided by these truths risks being swept away by the sea ofpolitrickalmediocrity. Due to space and
time – and primarily due to the title of this chapter – I will elaborate on
five of them.
To rank among the most remembered, richest, most talked about and most reversely blessed Nigerian politicians, you should abide by the following:
1. Be Uneducated:Now, now, do not look at me with such arrogance, learned Sir! I know you were schooled in one of the best institutions there are in the world. Don’t let your pride be wounded; learned Sir, will you trust my wealth of experience? Statistics released by The Nigerian School of Politrickal Science state that the Nigerian politician who comes across as uneducated is more likely to get elected than the educated one. Please note that education is not to be confused with schooling. Thing is, even if you would have your educational background known, then be prepared to have so much to show for it! You see, there are Nigerianpolitricktianswho went toabroadarianschools and have so much to show for their schooling: the highest case of covidiotism, cluelessness, expertise at rubbish-spewing, advanced thuggery andomo-agegeismetc., etc. You must be able to demonstrate – right from your campaigns – that you have no real plans for the betterment of the nation. I mean, if you make Nigeria better, where do you expect Nigerians to get statistics from whenever they boast of the toughness of their hides and how Nigerians can survive in any situation? Don’t you knowadaptability to suffernessis part of the Nigerian Dream? Points to note: Do not go to school, and even if you do, refuse to be educated! For your own good, learn to boast of your foreign degrees while committing grammatical blunders, and never let your actions and policies reflect that you were ever educated; that way, you are a step to becoming a quintessential Nigerian politician. What’s more?
2. Have Throawayable Money:As a Nigerian seeking to excel in politics, you must have folds and folds of money –throawayableones. This means that you must be a financial messiah: the source of your wealth hardly matters – be it shady business deals,yahoo-yahooism, money rituals or embezzlement of public funds. What matters is that you must be willing to spend on Nigerians. You were invited to a party? Whip the celebrant(s) with neat bundles of Naira notes! Nigerians are natural party-lovers, find excuses to cook plenty food as much as you can. Your 10-year-old goat died? Have a funeral for it. Nigerians would not mind attending, as long as they can get party jollof and drinks. Whenever you pass by people, ensure you throw neat Naira notes in the air; raise your hands high up and let the notes fly in diverse directions – the more Nigerians scramble and scratch for the notes, the more they will appreciate your benevolence. No one is asking you to invest, my learned Sir, you are being asked to spend! One fundamental thing is aligning your spending to the needs of the people closest to you: look at Daniel Ukperaa and the good he did for his people in Benue; meeting them at the very point of their needs by donating ropes to tie their goats with! Now, that is a man on the right path to becoming a quintessential Nigerian politician! There is also the sadly unknown benefactor who donated a fat tuber of yam per woman and an after-donation photoshoot to his constituents. You can follow in their footsteps.
3. Be Corruption-inclined:Learned Sir Olawale Godwin, do not underestimate the power of corruption in the catapulting of the average Nigerian from a street urchin to a celebratedpolitricktian! You want to occupy half of the pages in national dailies on your birthday? The fastest way is to be a Nigerian politician – not just any one, but a corrupt one. Your deftness at embezzling public funds, protecting ghost workers, supporting corrupt workers at government institutions and parastatals, awarding contracts to friends, family members and village people – whether they are capable or not – will determine how successful you would be as a Nigerianpolitricktian. In sum, the higher your level of corruption, the more respected you will be as a Nigerian politician. Don’t listen to ranters on Twitter; what ails them is that what they crave is out of their reach: they envy you so much, and want to be like you. You want proof for this? Just give them one shikini appointment as the Special Assistant to the Special Adviser to the Senior Special Adviser of the Senator Representing Oyo North Senatorial District – phiam! they will cease to trouble you. If you so much aspire to be a successful Nigerian politician, you must be corrupt; some learnt this lesson the hard way.
4. Know How to Organize and Distribute Blames:Learned Sir Godwin – and by extension, every prospective Nigerian politician -, one of the things you must cherish is your blame-laying skills; you must know how to lay blames! A very easy way is to lay blame on your predecessor(s), especially if they belong to the opposition party. I mean, for over four years, Furosident Muhammadum Mbuhari laid blames on the sixteen years the cankerworms and locusts of the Phiphul’s Democratic Party spent destroying our nation’s economy – and that helped him remain relevant even while neglecting his duties and responsibilities. It is not so difficult to find an object for your blame game in Nigeria; objects abound! You could give your blames spiritual undertones, psychological undertones, nonsensical undertones, etc. etc. Forget about the unscrupulous nature of your blames; there’s nothing new beneath the scorching sun of Nigeria. Just focus your attention on laying your irresponsibility at the feet of another.
5. Be Foresighted:Aha! The last on the list but definitely not the least! You are a Nigerian politician and you are not foresighted? What hope have you? Calm down, do not take this out of context: foresight here does not mean you should be think of ways to make the future better by doing things right today. Foresight here means you should start thinking and preparing for the next election, right from your first day in office! That will almost guarantee you re-election. You could even take your foresight a step further by subtly hinting at a re-election even before you assume office: weren’t Furosident Mbuhari’s plans – as contained in his 2011 manifesto – stretched across 8 years? Meaning Baba was prepared for a second term even before he got the opportunity to serve the first term. Did his confidence pay off? You bet it did, except you are also of the belief that Jubril has taken Mbuhari’s place. Without foresight, you will not do a good job of abiding by the other four truths, and without abiding by these truths, your goal of being the ultimate Nigerian politician will be as far away as change brought to Nigeria by the All Progressives’ Congress.
Learned Sir Olawale Godwin, I will
have you know – at this point – that these are only four of the sacred truths
that you must hold dear as a Nigerian who wishes to become a quintessential
politician. There are, of course, other truths, such as: being a terrible liar,
or having aides that are terrible liars, having a good knowledge of the
appropriate use of “By God’s grace”, “God willing” and other related
statements, making promises and never keeping to them, etc., etc.

Mr Integrity,https://punocracy.com/mr-integrity/,2020-09-20T10:04:17+01:00,"By: Sunday Michael Oyeleke
You think sleeping in a gold-plated duvet you newly acquired from China will cure the inner persisting drumming in one of your ears. But it hasn’t.
You lie alone awake on your exotic bed that is of a standard football pitch in size; that is said to be the finest from Milan, and is said to be lesser than a feather in weight when you sleep on it. But it always feels like a rock every morning you wake alone on it, especially since you mistakenly relegate your wife to the kitchen and other rooms in the village when gibbering with some of your distant friends and it gets to your her hearing. You miss her cuddling every night and wish she will forgive you in the privacy of your bedroom without demanding that you bend a knee for her in public over your unruly remark about her in public.
It appears your Asonia (inability to clearly distinguish the difference in people’s voices) has got worse since you return to Aso village – the same village some of your kingmaker-friends have once conspired and banished you from about four decades ago. Your long convoy movement around your village last night shows nothing has really changed except all your old mates in class.
You wonder how they have grown so big that they cannot pass through a single door entrance anymore. Even when a set of two adjoining doors is fully opened for them to access any house other than theirs, they have to squeeze in their pot-like bellies that they all seems to wear as uniform. You are grateful to Allah you have not become like them because you and your childhood’s favourite stick of sugarcane can equally compete not only in width but also height. You chewed such stick only sometimes ago to calm your nerves after a taxing day with your rat-infested office – that in particular, where the finest quality of rodenticide is produced and stored.
You rise from the bed and remember last night’s quarrel with your since-childhood family doctor-friend in the village, Mallam Ado. You have just lost him from the list of your friends in the village who have nicked you “Mr Integrity”. Mr Ado is obviously angry that you have lost confidence in his treatment.
He grumps like Trump, the United States President on Twitter ever since you leave the village, “Haba, Mr. Bo Harry! Even if you had wanted to replace the whole ear with that of the elephant, why lose faith in me now? Didn’t you promise you will never leave the village for any treatment as all your mates in class have been doing? Didn’t you promise to give me all I need in the village that even distant medicine men and their kinsmen will come to me for their treatment?” But you wave it off with the thought that you have many other friends in the village who still call you Mr Integrity.
You hear hoaxes that nothing has really changed since you return to the Aso village and you decide you’ll use this morning to inspect the village again. You order a long trekking convoy to inspect for yourself and realize they are all just hate speeches from envious villagers that can never be pleased.
You wonder why they have not noticed the tall bushes that now bury the poles and transformers installed by Lugard himself which now enable the village hunters to comfortably tarry their sleep under the warm arms of their wives while antelopes walk up to them at their bedroom and pythons glide into their wives’ cooking pots, just waiting for those who love snake meal to come and strike a match.
You wonder why they have not noticed the fish ponds that have been extended to the roads during raining season so the village fishermen won’t need to stress themselves going far for a river. You wonder why they have not noticed the lazy youths you have sponsored to Lalaland and who are now so busy with playing Baba Ijebu. You wonder why they have not noticed that everyone is now ungainful vigilantes day and night. You wonder in every wandering in the long convoy.
As usual, some of the villagers hail you as you stand out in the trekking convoy “Bo Harry! Sai Bo Harry!” But a chap suddenly leaps forward among the villagers and his voice overrides every other saying, “Mister Integrity cried when we told him we pay as high as 97 Naira for a pint of fuel. He cried with us and promised then. And today we buy it cheaper at 145 Naira. All hail our messiah! All hail Bo…” You order some aides and they throw him into one of their vans in the convoy.
Not long, a boy, whose black skin is like a transparent nylon covering a woven frame of tiny sticks, is blown forward by the wind. The wind gathers and brings to your ears the sound that seems to emanate from his parted lips thus, “Misa Intagiti, mama said you cr-i-ed and liduce supergati be four 80 Naira, now 200 Nai…” But you order some aides and they “Kai!” him into evaporating into the crowd.
Almost instantaneously, an aged man leaps forward shaking his entire body as he stammers, “Mi mi-ster Inte-intefriti, can can you tell us who, who,who g-g-ive you inte-inte-tefri-friti? You, you cry and, and and promise to, to to, to to give us 5000 Nai-ra montily. You prom-ise only one, one one, one term but this, th-is is se-second cond term.” You also order some aides and they throw him into one of their vans in the convoy. You soon order the end of the tour and return to your home that same morning. You feel unwell and order another appointment with your ear doctor faraway. Now, it seems you have lost your hearing completely. You have become the ghost of yourself. The people in the village now call you many names but none seems to remember their lateMr Integrity.

The Gospelpreneur — Letter to David,https://punocracy.com/the-gospelpreneur-letter-to-david/,2020-09-20T09:43:32+01:00,"By: Solomon Nzere
Dear David,
It is my distinct pleasure to welcome you into the
world’s most prestigious and lucrative profession;The Order of Cloaks and
Collars. You may recognize some of our members by their titles; Pastors,
Prophets, Reverends, Bishops or for the more eccentric Worldwide Founder, Most
Reverend, Senior Apostle and so on.
Whatever we call ourselves, we are united by our
common goal, make this money! (and win souls for Jesus too, that should always
come first in official communication). This country is hard, your mates are in
Canada, tax rates have increased and nobody is replying your mails for that
elusive job.
We are here for you and in the course of this letter;
you will learn how to win hearts and pockets. I will hand over the keys to this
time-honoured trade that will have you sowing cars and flying jets in no time.
But first, you must learn how to navigate the tool
that puts your hands in pockets; the fine art of a perfectly executed Sunday
service.
Most of your congregation will just be coming in from
Saturday club crawling and alcohol-fueledOwanbeafter-parties so you must be gentle with them. This means nodie by fireprayers or rapid praying in tongues session to start the service.
This is where your most important tool comes in; MUSIC!
Whatever you do, do not underestimate the power of music in your church if you
want to make it in this profession.
Invest in great sound, quality instruments and people
that can sing their hearts out. It doesn’t matter if they are deluded that the
church stage will be some grand platform to launch them into stardom. Let your
choir soothe your crowd, get them dancing to beats reminiscent of last night’s
partying and then drop them at the bus stop of the seventh heaven with
heartfelt worship. Leave them there, crying, shouting and confessing sins on
the altar, only then are they ripe for the taking.
Now it’s time for you to deliver your message but
there is still no need for you to be in a rush. (Think of it as intense
foreplay, all those slow and measured moves are worth it in the end) If it is
your style, take over the worship, sing a couple of songs and drop your opening
prayer.
If you do not have the vocal cords for the job, then you need ahype manin your life. Your hype man is basically someone that sets the energy in the room and gets the crowd excited to hear you preach. Your hype man doesn’t have to be someone too deep, a few jokes here and there, theturn to your neighbourroutine and you are good to go. Lookout for young, relatable chaps in your church to fill this role. (Pro- tip:In my experience, people with stints as student pastors of trendy school fellowships are the perfect recruits for this position.)
If your hype man has done his job well you will have an attentive audience ready to hear you preach for the next few minutes. The order strongly encourages brevity, the very best make a quick work of salvation. (Plus there’s Instagram and Twitter to compete with for attention.)
Honestly, this is the hardest part of the job, trying
to keep grown men and women awake. The key is to keep it short, sharp and
relatable. Infuse it with personal stories they can relate with. Not to worry,
you don’t actually have to have cast out demons or performed miracles to tell
stories; you will get a bonus copy of the order’s bestseller: STORIES FOR EVERY
MESSAGE. But this thing called Sleep is a bastard so here are a couple of tips
to keep them awake and listening.
Numbers— No, not the bible book, actual figures. Always break your message down into numbered points so they can follow and wake up at the appropriate points. Think; 7 Keys, 10 blessings, 5 barriers and so on. Have them repeat the points to you as you go on so they don’t doze.
Tweet that! — If they
are going to be tweeting for half of the service anyway, how about giving them
something to tweet about. Give those punch lines and quotes that they can write
in their journals, use as Instagram captions, WhatsApp status and tweets.
Crowd participation— How does a one-hit-wonder elongate his performance at a mega concert? By organizing a twerking contest on stage. In the same way, you must learn to use your crowd and give them something to feed upon. Bring your message home by getting them to act your message out on stage to illustrate your points.
Turn to your neighbour— This one is a gift that keeps giving. Use this to get your congregation back without fail. Get them to repeat your catchphrases and scriptures to their neighbours every once in a while, the combination of bad breath and invasion of personal space should get everyone awake.
You must always end the way you begin; with worship!
Let your keyboardist punctuate your last few sentences with soulful chords as
you announce to their relief that you would close soon.
Get them standing, arms outstretched as they make
affirmations, declare blessings, tell them process and protocol would be
discarded for their favour and drop themic.Your work here is done, sit down and relax as your hype man and choir usher the

Ugly God,https://punocracy.com/ugly-god/,2020-09-20T09:28:54+01:00,"By: Sami Tunji
God comes to our house one dusty evening and tells us in a deep baritone that my father will have a car. A red car, precisely. The colour of Jesus’ blood. We say amen until we feel a scratch behind our throats. God, a lanky un-bearded bald man in a shiny white cassock, adds with the fervency of the Holy Ghost that we should expect the car in three days. Number three metamorphoses into living beings going to and fro the entire room of my mind: 3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3ℇ3 … I begin to think about anything related to the number three, trying to make the word of God more significant: Trinity, Jesus rose on the third day,aje meta…. I pause ataje meta, and ask Jesus to cast and bind every witch who wants to hinder the fulfilment of God’s word.
“Messenger of God, you haven’t finished your malt?”
It’s a humble suggestion-question of reminder from my pious father in Yoruba to
God, who has just finished praying and prophesying and is about to leave. The
half-drunk Maltina sits with humility on the table; its dark-brown eyes
laser-focus on me as I bend my neck to look at it with thirsty eyes. I pray God
will say “no, thanks” and leave the drink so that I can gulp it down later. But
he stretches out his hand before I finish the prayer in my mind, holds the
bottle in a firm grip around its neck, lifts it up to his patchy lips, and
swallows the remaining content in a single gulp, that kind that can make you
win a drinking competition.
Before God leaves, my father squeezes some money
into the tiny offering basket of his hand. I think one hundred or two hundred naira
note for him to take an okada back to his house or to the house of another
church member. One thing is sure as he leaves, his prophecy has etched out a
smile on the face of every member of my family. My father is smiling. My mother
is smiling. I, the firstborn, am smiling. My two younger sisters are smiling.
Uncle Kaz, my mother’s brother from the village, is smiling too. It feels like
a warm sun is shining on the sky of our faces. I wish a photographer can just
enter now and take a picture. Snap snap snap! My mother bursts into praises,
“He’s a miracle working God…” We sing along with her in dancing feet – a family
of terrible singers too happy to know how terrible our voices sing.
Three days take long and do not take long to come.
They are here: the third day and the red car. I am the first to see a red car
parked on the street, a few feet away from my father’s bungalow. It’s around
11am on a Friday, I think. I am filled with the joy of the Lord. I almost
become a mad boy on the street.
My father is not at home. My mother is in her shop,
some feet further away. I’m not sure where my siblings are anymore. But I spot
Uncle Kaz and beckon him towards me. He comes. The smile on his face tells me
he knows why I have called him. He is excited too. We are both filled with the
joy of the Lord.
We touch the car as if we are touching Jesus’
garment. The car, which model I’m not sure of, is not very clean, as if someone
has been using it for a long time. But in my mind, I imagine that the angels of
God, like they had walked a long mile to visit Father Abraham, must have ridden
it from a long distance through our un-tarred, dusty, rough road to this place;
that explains the dusty and used state of the car.
Uncle Kaz and I stay beside the car for about 30
minutes. Awe is etched like tribal marks on our faces. I stand beside the car,
posing, knowing this must be my father’s car that God prophesied about.
“God is miraculous!” I say to Uncle Kaz and want to
say to everyone that walks on the street, but I am waiting for my father to
come back from work and put the car key, which might have been delivered to him
in his office, in the car, and start the car, and take us for a ride of pride
around the street, saying, “This is what the Lord has done, and it is
marvellous in our sight.”
We are still standing beside the car when a strange
man, not as tall as God, comes to invade and steal my father’s car. The man
walks like the owner of the car that God has given my father. After smiling at
us, the man opens the door of the car, steps in, inserts the key, starts the
car and drives off, leaving dusty space and surprised faces.
“Maybe God changed his mind…” Uncle Kaz mutters.
There is no more smile on our faces. I begin to question myself like a
detective questioning a criminal. What have we done wrong? Was I too excited?
Did any of my family members sin? Why did God change his mind? I kneel on the
street and beg God to forgive us and return the car until Uncle Kaz asks us to
go inside the house. His mouth reeks of disappointment. As we walk the very
short distance home, it feels like everyone walking on the street can see how
disappointed we are, and they are laughing hard in the private corner of their
minds.
When my father returns from work, I refuse to tell
him about the car. In fact, it seems everyone has forgotten about the prophecy,
except me.
I grow up, realizing that God actually lied to us.
Yes, God lied. And he lied hard. That car belonged to that man, not my father.
God deceived us! He fooled us! Damn!
Thirteen years later (and I know that for the rest of my life), any time I hear the name of God, a picture of a lanky un-bearded bald man in a shiny white cassock stained with speckles of that lie creeps (and will continue to creep) into my mind. And God becomes (and will continue to be) ugly. Very very ugly.

The Nigerian handbook on how to get a man,https://punocracy.com/the-nigerian-handbook-on-how-to-get-a-man/,2020-09-18T08:54:04+01:00,"By: Orisaheyi Bisola Omolade
Hello there. If you are reading this, you are either a desperate Nigerian woman in need of professional advice on how to secure a man or a Nigerian man who would like to understand women and why they do what they do. For those who fall under the former category, it is expected that you discard all prior knowledge you have about getting a man seeing as it didn’t get you anywhere,no offence. Why do you want a man? Why can’t you get a man? What kind of Nollywood movies do you watch? Do you think you are cursed? Are you ready to sacrifice to get the man you want? These are important questions you need to ask yourself. Answer truthfully and you may not even have to read this.
We shall begin with the most sensitive topic: sex. You see, virginity is for underage girls; a social construct that hardly holds water. Once you celebrate your eighteenth birthday, it is mandated that you find anything with a penis to stretch your hymen. After all, fornication was created by God to be enjoyed by all. I must warn you, however, if you also enjoy pain while urinating, consuming different pills daily, or in extremely rare cases, pregnancy, do not use a condom. Some of you may be tagged ‘holier than thou’ with a school of thought that says no to premarital sex and hence decide to skip step one. It will not end well I tell you, but what am I here for? I advise that you read my next book titled ‘How To Lie Efficiently To Avoid Sex’ coming out next year by God’s grace. I beseech that you do not pull the ‘VIRGIN TILL MARRIAGE’ card on any man. Nobody will pay for a car they can’t drive first.
To get a man in Nigeria is the second easiest thing, after passing JAMB and entering the University in one attempt. If you have the money, your wardrobe should include the latest outfits, wigs, bags and shoes. Remember, you need to give something to gain something. But if you are on a tight budget, there’s a market in a certain state known for great imitations. You won’t be able to tell the fakes from the originals until you get home and put it on but that doesn’t matter, it’sLewis Vitton. The concept of ‘Packaging’ is very important and not to be taken lightly if you want a rich man who will love you for your character and not your looks.(After all, it is this same ‘looks’ that will train your future children and teach them how to be like you, or even better). Manners can only take you so far and besides, who wants to talk to a pauper who can’t buy sharwama, cake and ice-cream when you have the cravings? You’re free to snub everyone and anyone who doesn’t look rich enough to afford you.
Dear ladies, rich men are mostly found in the following places: church, school, club, hotel, mall, road, firms, airport, seaport, restaurant, mosque, shrine and in your dreams. Make sure you always wear your indecent dresses to these places to avoid being caught unfresh. Your cleavage is a measure of the attention you deserve, so display it accordingly. Know that you are undebatably beautiful without makeup, but just imagine how you’d look with longer lashes, pink eyelids, a pointed nose, heart-shaped lips and a smooth acne-free face! Lucky are those with big breasts and ass for our Nigerian men only have eyes for them, but be mindful of the belly fat. If you are skinny (A.K.A plasma TV), you may choose from varying options such as taking pills and herbs to become thick, going to the gym for revenge body or simply loving yourself the way you are.
For all those who choose self-love, I must warn you beforehand that your self-love will not help you in a party when you can’tshake what your mama gave youand make your man proud. Fun fact: did you know that your walking step speaks volumes? Please, arch your back, suck your stomach in and catwalk like Rihanna. You are the definition of elegance and perfection; act like it. Never forget to check for rings or ring marks on their fingers before initiating a conversation with a prospect, I’m only here to teach you how to get a man not be a home breaker.
On no account must you bring out theNigerian womanin you in the presence of a prospect. You must involve words such as ‘uhm’,‘gotta’,‘kinda’,‘duuh’, ‘wanna’,‘ain’t’and so on in your speech with a touch of British accent so you sound elite. If he takes you to a restaurant, order classy dishes like fried rice and chicken with salad and plantain by the side. If you must eat swallow, do so with a fork. You don’t want to mess up that expensive manicure, do you? Remember it is mandatory to order takeaway for your friends at home so they know he’s rich. If he says no, make a scene, delete his number and place him in the‘most useless dates/guys’category. During conversations, the truth is hardly needed. He won’t always want to hear about your hobbies or your five siblings. There’s a book titled ‘Devil Behavior/Skills All Desperate Women Should Have’. It’s not out yet but I believe it will have everything you need. I highly recommend you follow influencers like Bobrisky, Mercy Eke, Tacha and Toke Makinwa on Instagram for free tutorials in the course ‘Packaging and Social Media’.
For women above thirty, whenever you look at the mirror, constantly remind yourself that you are five years younger than your age. The more you say this to yourself and the men who ask, the younger you become. Never tell a man your real age. It is not only an abomination; it can attract curses from your dead village people and you are likely to die a spinster. You must always have makeup on to hide those wrinkles and irritating saggy cheeks or you may go for a botox surgery to make your ‘forever young’journey official.
If you are really in need of a man, you should know by now that things such as obtaining a degree, starting a career, or getting a job should be the least of your worries. Men have the ability to solve financial problems. All you need to know about your country is the first stanza of the national anthem and the president’s name in case you need to apply for a visa. I suggest you read the news on Opera mini because they are all true and in the future, if you must talk about the Nigerian economy in the midst of your husband and his friends, make sure you are  inaudible and return back to the kitchen quickly because that is your place. Your voice doesn’t count when you are married. You are the weaker vessel and must act like it if you want to keep the man you have worked so hard to get.
Now, kindly get a pen and paper or take a screenshot because this is important. It’s only normal to save the best for the last, please allow me to introduce the fastest and surest ticket to get a man in Nigeria. We have products ranging from Special Packages to Kayanmata to Favour Oil to Blue Eye Bracelet to Spiritual Body Scrub to Touch And Do; to mention but a few, all at jaw dropping prices. Interested buyers may contact Angela Nwosu, Omashola or Jaaruma Empire at your own risk and disappointment. The only disadvantage to this method is that marriage is not guaranteed. But who wouldn’t want a fine lady like you as a baby mama or a side chick? For the less privileged (with money), you can visit your local shrine, and should the native doctor request for too much, get a picture of the prospect and await Shiloh or any other ‘My-year-of-marriage’church programme in the following year. The Bible says in Matthew 21:22, ‘If you believe, whatever you ask for in prayer, you will receive’. Don’t be carried away though. When your reverend or pastor makes an altar call for single women, stay in your seat. You don’t want to look overly needy and desperate.
Finally, when this book magically helps you get a man, make sure you get the proposal you deserve. Don’t settle for a quiet one. To show his undying  love for you, he’ll arrange the kind of proposal that will trend for years on social media and anyone who has functional hormones will comment ‘God when?’ under the post. 2 Corinthians 15:7 says ‘But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded’. Trust me, I also hope this work will be rewarded.

How to raise a true believer,https://punocracy.com/how-to-raise-a-true-believer/,2020-09-18T08:45:07+01:00,"By: Oluwatimilehin Odueso
Dear Demide,
Or should I call you Mama Baby now?!
I congratulate you on your safe delivery. May God
Almighty watch this one for us. May this child grow up to fulfil his destiny.
As you know, children of these days are becoming
difficult to handle and our hold on them is fast declining. It has become more
important for us to teach our children our ways, to show them how important it
is to be god-fearing.
This is why I am sending you Pastor Salvation’s
pamphlet on how to raise a child in these harsh times. You know how powerful
that man of God is. I sent it to my daughter, Bodunde, who, as you know, lives
in Wisconsin and she says it’s made raising my grandchild much easier. In her last
letter, she says the child even prefers Psalms to regular bedtime stories, what
a true child of God!
I am sure it will help you too. It is a powerful
pamphlet. I have no doubt that both your child and you will benefit from it.
Please send my regards to your husband. I will
continue praying for you and your child.
Yours Lovingly,
Evangelist (Mrs.) Bosede Ajetunde, AKA Aje Jesu
by Pastor Salvation Isreal, G.O, D.I.T.L
(₦500 only)
I will go straight to the point.
I received inspiration for this piece while my lovely
wife was heavily pregnant with our fifth child. We were living in a one-bedroom
apartment at the time, soaking garri day and night. Beloved, it was not pretty.
I felt the urge to pray for direction and I was led to the mountain by the most
high.
I don’t know how long I was there for, maybe four or
five days, all the while without food, water or even bathing! I was just
waiting for an answer.
This answer came when I received a call that my wife
had given birth. The most high told me, “I have shown you the way. Don’t
you know why I have blessed you with many children? Don’t you know it’s so that
you can be an example for others on how to save their children from the devil’s
trap?”
I grabbed this message, beloved, I liistened. And
thankfully, that is how this, my sixth child, was born.
“Train
up children in the way they should go and when they are old, they will not
depart from it“
— Proverbs 22:6
Don’t wait too long, please. Start from birth, from
pregnancy if possible. The first words that leave the lips of your toddler must
be the lyrics of a praise and worship song; if it is not, then know that the
devil has already begun to work.
So start from birth. Rub anointing oil onto the scalp,
the spirit must seep into the child. Whisper psalms into ears while they sleep,
take them to church services so they can see how things are done.
See, the devil will try to thwart your efforts; you
will see other parents telling you to let your child learn a skill early, maybe
musical instruments or a new language or computers. Ignore them! Let your child
seek the most high’s face alone and all these things, all those talents and
material things other parents are chasing after, will be added unto your own.
(See Matthew 6:33).
This is the most important thing, in raising a true
believer.
Everybody, of course, needs a reason to be good, so
let your child’s reason be God. Good people go to heaven, bad people, hell. If
you tell your child this, such child will grow up with the fear of God in them.
That’s the best kind of fear, isn’t that glorious?!
This is what we need more of in this country. God
fearing children who know that the most high is watching their every move. How
can they make bad decisions when they know this? How can they possibly err?
The cane is your friend, so don’t be afraid to use it!
Children can be disobedient, you know. And it is not
their fault, it is the devil trying to plant Eve’s seed in them. Be ready,
beloved! Be watchful and ready.
You will need a good punitive machine to help you sink lessons into the creases of your child’s skin. Please consider thin bamboo sticks (soak in water for added benefits), a strong leather belt, Dunlop slippers or simple household wiring will do.
There will be trials; people will watch you discipline
your child and tell you that beating doesn’t change anything. Some will even go
as far as chastising you, telling you that your loving care is child abuse.
Laugh at them, beloved, for you are a Nigerian and our country knows the
benefit of Proverbs 13:24.
I have had some parents ask me, “Ah, but Pastor,
what if we wound them?” To them, and to you, I say, “If God didn’t
want any of us to wounded, he wouldn’t have given us the power to heal!”
Be careful, though. Sometimes, caning will not send
the devil running. You may need to employ other punitive measures so feel free
to explore your creative side.
I know it is difficult, beloved, seeing your child in
agony as your whip bites their skin. Take comfort in Proverbs, take comfort in
knowing that you have been ordained by God to do this, take comfort in knowing
that you do it with love.
If you still doubt the power of the cane, look at
Nigerians today, did our own parents not chant Proverbs while they landed
koboko on our backs and buttocks? Look at us now, did we not turn out fine and
well-rounded?
The cane is a trusty friend, beloved. Use it!
This one is very important parents. Be careful what
your child consumes.
In Matthew 5:8, we are told that only the pure of
heart will see the most high. So if you want your child to go to heaven, be
careful not to broach the S word.
Remove all instances of the act from your lives. Don’t
be too emotional or romantic with your spouse in front of your child, you are
raising one from the chosen generation, not a hooligan! When you and your
spouse are visiting the promised land, you must be like David, sneaking
Bathsheba into his palace – quiet but steady. The promised land is not the time
to speak in tongues beloved! Tame your body.
Start early too, teach them that their bodies are
temples that must not be fondled with, not even when they bathe! A splash in
front, a quick wipe at the back will be enough; lest they turn outa gay,
God forbid!. Be watchful, keep your eyes on them as they grow. If they ever
linger, don’t forget to discipline them. My personal advice: chop up some bell
pepper, mix in with hot water to make a paste, and add to the affected areas.
It works wonders.
The only leader your child will need, are those in
church.
Have you forgotten Exodus 20:3? Do not let anyone take
the place of the most high in your child’s life, He is the only leader they
will need.
Let your child stay away from politics! No voting, no
campaigning, not even joining political parties. All God’s children
automatically belong to the Chosen Generation, that’s is the best political
party there is. All others are traps by the devil to plant greed and wanton
into the hearts of the people.
If you see that your child has leadership qualities,
bring them to the church and rejoice for your child has been heavenly ordained
an evangelist, he or she will win souls into the party.
Let them pay their taxes to Him, it is the only way
the most high can assure your child a place on the golden street. Do not see it
as tithing, see it as down payment for your mansion in heaven!
Children are precious jewels, and like gold, they have
to pass through certain processes that will help filter impurities.
This is not always a clear path and this is why God
asked me to guide you with this message. Believe me, beloved, if you take this
message to heart, your children will turn out like fine communion wine.
If you enjoyed this pamphlet, bless another soul with
it. Why not let others share in your testimony as well? Remember what Luke 6:38
says? Give, and it will come back to you!!!
There will be discount for those who buy in bulk!
Remain blessed, beloved, and may God continue to watch
over us all.

Good
day beautiful people of Niagara.
Is
this microphone working?
Hey!
Sound man!
How
do I defend myself and my colleagues if the good people of this country can not
hear me?
Niagarans,
this is an example of what I came to explain.
We
are all corrupt in our beloved country. It just happens we are the politicians.
Is
the microphone working better now?
Once again, good day Niagarans.
Haba!
Sound
man, how much were you paid to set this up and a simple microphone is not
working?
You
were just paid half?
Why
did you not borrow and do a better job?
That
is what we do as sworn-in politicians.
We
borrow and the successor pays.
Some
citizens have accused us of embezzlement.
We
do not embezzle.
We
only spend on our families, friends and not forgetting the various channels we
borrowed from to contest.
Honestly,
we all plan to return your money.
Immediately
we enter our office, we have to fortify ourselves by buying cars and building
mansions and saving for the rainy days.
The
stress of the last two affects our physical and mental health so we need to
travel out of the country to rest.
We
should rest in Niagara?
Our
hospitals are not up to standard.
Mr
journalist, you do not have to look at me like that.
Blame
our predecessors.
We
met it like that.
Are
you here to argue with me?
No.
I
thought as much.
Let
me continue.
By
the time we rest and are back, ready to begin the task written on our
manifestoes, our tenure is over.
Other
politicians would agree with me that four years are not enough to meet our
goals.
That
is why we try to run for another term.
I
can see my colleagues nodding their heads in approval.
I
wish you all can understand our dilemma.
I
recently saw an article applauding us, and I prayed for the journalist.
God
bless her.
Why
did we not complete any project?
Most
of us started road projects but had to stop halfway.
Allocation
was redirected for our wardrobe allowance.
You
all would agree that it is better your leader is well dressed than a good road.
I,
for one, wish to complete my state road if you vote me in for second term.
I
have begun a good work, and I wish to finish it.
Education?
Our
education system is doing great.
Good
people of Niagara, you need to know it is not about the building, it is about
the content.
We
try to recruit good teachers.
Mr
journalist, we do not owe anyone.
We
are only trying to help everyone save their money.
If
we pay every month, everyone will spend it all and fast.
We
keep your money for some months.
I
feel satisfied seeing the jubilation when we pay late.
Some
might even be thanking me in their hearts.
Some
citizens complained of lack of electricity.
Once
again, blame our predecessors.
The
security our beloved country is far better than the days old, days of war.
We
believe we are trying our best and so advice everyone to protect him or
herself.
Get
some machetes and be vigilant.
Also
pray .
Watch
and pray.
You
see, even the sound man is nodding his head in approval.
We,
on the other hand, are your leaders, so we deserve guard by armoured cars and
able-bodied men.
You
know, if the head is hurt, the rest of the body will feel it.
Good.
Any
other area we need to defend?
Youth
empowerment!
How
did I forget that?
We
have recruited some youths as our boys.
This
has taken them out of the streets.
The
females have been employed has secretaries.
They
travel with us especially when our wives are unavoidably absent.
So,
other youths should rest assured that we will fix them in various sectors soon.
Good
citizens of Niagara, you would be impressed with our we have curbed food
insecurity.
Some
of you would testify to the one Congo or mudu of rice we shared during
Christmas.
Some
even received a thousand naira.
Many
expressed gratitude but I stopped them.
Why
are we your leaders if we cannot make you smile?
We
promise to give more welfare package especially if we are all allowed to lead
for 8 years.
People
of Niagara, we are so glad you could hear us out.
To
those who applaud us, we do not take this for granted.
We
have some packages for you, just come to our offices with evidence.
To
those that criticize us, we hope this press talk has revealed our good side.
On
behalf of my colleagues and I, we wish to thank you for your audience.
With
our good leadership, we see Niagara rubbing shoulders with the first-world
countries.
Long
live good citizens of Niagara.
Long
live politicians of Niagara.
Long live Niagara.

Ubuntu; I am because you are!,https://punocracy.com/ubuntu-i-am-because-you-are/,2020-09-18T08:28:06+01:00,"By: Oluwadamilare Ajiboye
God dey hear, one very commendable lifestyle in Nigeria is being your neighbours’ keeper and relatives’ caregivers. It doesn’t matter if it sits well with you, you have to religiously look out for those who are fortunate enough to know you. The beauty of this is that, when Nigeria happens to you — as it is certain it would — you get a return of your gesture in multiple folds. Beyond this, however, is the Ubuntu philosophy of life in Nigeria; an understanding that you are because some people, state of things or institutions are.
This philosophy is what makes us what we are. It is why in a country run solely on individuals’ vibes and street-club cruise, there are more jokers lurking around government offices than there are citizens who are ready to laugh. The Nigerian Ubuntu philosophy does not teach you to accommodate others’ opinions or consider their conditions, you simply live your life the way you feel in your soul. It is a taboo to feel sorry for your deeds or apologise for your goofs. With Ubuntu, the elders and powerful are infallible, hence they can never err. It was this philosophy at play when the Media Aides of the Septuagenarian in Aso Villa only made a shot at embroidering the president’s careless utterance in 2018 rather than apologising for the goof of tagging Nigerian youths lazy.
The story about the Nigerian Ubuntu is long and the listeners are patient, but I fear if I let out more than it’s necessary, those affected will come for me. So, in my own selfish interest I have only chosen to write about the ones that have lost their credibility and would have no moral justification to chase after me even if they find it offensive.
Think about it, how can Nigeria ever survive without the input of foreign countries handling out Abacha’s loot then and now like school children’s lunch break money? Except we are solely ungrateful, we need to appreciate the foreign countries in Europe and America which are our politicians’ safe haven, they are where their health records and their children’s academic records sit. When we refuse to make plans for the future, it is because we trust their agape love to always make room for financial aids and debt moratorium  when we demand it. Even though we are like the dog tied to the belt of Ogun with no hope for the future, but because you formed us from the beginning and pronounced us into existence, we cannot forsake you.
Although,
there are some over-educated activists in Lagos and Abuja who find it fun to
derail the government from recuperating its R.O.I on election expenses by
clamouring for something as ephemeral as good governance, one enviable thing,
however, about Nigerians is that we respect the government with stubborn
affection. Of course, this respect is a function of our understanding that we
only exist because the Umbrella and Broom party are still the ones alternating
the seat of power, doing all it takes to discourage exploitation of our
differences for political gains and rejuvenating the promises of free
education. Because the government has not really disappointed, except for not
dolling out $1 million each out of the recently recovered $311 million Abacha’s
loot to the 200 million population and still keeping the remaining $111 million
for miscellaneous expenses, we cannot shift our loyalty. Even if we do shift
our loyalty, where or to whom would we shift it? Certainly not the USA where
the president was so unpatriotic he advocated the injection of disinfectant
into their citizens, how much more then would he call to be done to citizens
from the shit-hole country?
In those days, before the popularity of water-closet and after the discouragement of open defecation, what was the norm was a setting where big pits were dug and strong wooden planks placed on them with multiple openings to allow passage of faeces into the pit when you squat to do your business. This kind of arrangement that simultaneously accommodated folks of all ages brought excessive familiarity between lads and lords, and, before long, became a thing of disrespect after lads began to make mental measurements and comparison of everything that defined a man then. In identical way, the public tertiary institutions that brought ambitious youths and accomplished lecturers together have sought to remove the aura of exaggerated sense of dignity and managerial expertise exclusively belonging to our lecturers. How, for instance, will inexperienced students challenge the quality of the gowns’ thinking?
Truth be told, the gowns may not have clues on how to tackle herculean problems on campus like light and water, but they certainly have clues on everything else under the sun. Besides, the public tertiary institution is not a place for fanfare, it is a place where you master the art of making lemonades out of lemons thrown at you. That is why I still insist that Students who protest the lack of water and light during exams miss the point. Those of us who already understand that Nigerian schools are a debut of Nigeria itself would never waste time on some goof-off protests, not even if we sojourn from the department of electrical engineering down across the school main gate to pay the guy with the patched tobacco umbrella and the I-better-pass-your-university generator to power our phone batteries and reading lamps.
Students
need to understand the simple philosophy of getting educated in government
schools; they are because their institutions, model vice-chancellors and
Rectors are still existing. We should learn to suffer now, develop tough skin
and suffer less later in life. Never attempt to criticise your Institution’s
rulers or demand potable water. If you do, depending on how the Media reports
your heroic deed, you may get suspended for a session- the institution’s way of
providing you enough time to dredge a well in your parents’ house and pass the
pipe to your hostel room. Indeed, once you learn that government public school
is only a breeding ground for the many shanty lifestyle of the Nigerian state,
you would understand the beauty of not unsettling stagnant water without
preparations to get yourself dirty.
I wish I was bold enough to play on the Inspector General’s transmission goof of 2018. I mean, I perfectly know how to “transmission” the pun to such extent that sergeant Tunji on the highway, with P.O.S for customers who do not have cash at hand, would read and find additional reason to smile asides the non-taxable profit he makes daily, but I fear my case may get a speedy transmission to the Force headquarters in Abuja. And being someone who, unlike our wealthy politicians, cannot even afford the services of a single senior advocate, I would rather let the sleeping dog lie than allow Nigerian charge and bail lawyers waste the precious time of the court when they know I am already a qualified candidate for the Nigerian prisons.
Saying
the Nigerian police is not your friend is only slightly related to the truth.
First of all, the members of the police are our moral betters and are only
doing their best to uphold African morality, that is why a member of the police
only needs to look at your un-African dressing from a distance and tell if you
are nursing or have nursed the ambition to defraud white folks of their
hard-earned cash, the good lord helps you an I-phone is found on you; forget
it, that’s conclusive proof of your criminal involvement. Let’s even consider
it, how would you- a citizen of the poverty capital of the world- be so
insensitive to live a lifestyle that does not reflect the state of your
economy? It only portrays you as unpatriotic, and that is what the Nigerian
Police Force hates. They can tolerate everything, but not the deliberate
attempt to ridicule the Nigerian state by an over-excited bloody civilian.
Ideally, the default reaction of Nigerians to the above situations is just to leave it for God and allow Karma take its course, but recently it seems that the game has changed and karma has forgotten its coveted role in the Nigerian affairs. What is now the new normal is that the bad guys are dying old in private hospitals leaving wealth for their children and children’s children who would also live flamboyantly, grow old and die in world-class hospitals. But, here we all are- the rest of us surviving on less than a dollar a day- regretting everything except our abstinence from politics and our clergies’ prophecy of an imminent boom of wealth. Truly, the affairs of this life isn’t balanced. We may not survive till the end, but we will always uphold the Ubuntu lifestyle of our fathers and the fathers who have gone before our fathers’ fathers.

A Covid-19 Patient’s Prayer While in Isolation Center

I am, Lord have mercy on me!
I
know I am a sinner but God you are loving and merciful
Forgive
me for all your goodness and wellness which I took for granted
Forgive
my ignorance and despise towards Corona Virus

I
am so shy to make sounds and melodies with my voice but now sneezing and
coughing are the melodies I helplessly make.

Restore
my health unto me and I will go warning all men that ‘Covid-19 is real’
No longer will I take time, warm handshakes and hugs for granted.

Becoming a Nigerian parent,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-nigerian-parent/,2020-09-17T09:30:23+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
If not for the Nigerian way of raising children, we
will not have a working society as we have. If I lie, look northwards and see
the laudable achievements they’re making with childbearing and child
upbringing.
The first rule on how to be a good parent in Nigeria
is to marry as many men/women as possible in noble poverty. No one will
question you. You don’t even need to cut your clothing according to your size.
Your minimum wage monthly salary will rise, like ‘garri ijebu’, as you
forcefully bring the innocent children to this earth to enjoy the
ever-flourishing life in Nigeria with you. Just walk in faith because God will provide
for their needs. After all, faith doesn’t require any common sense. God will do
it when the children come.
Fulfill the mandate that your religion teaches: “Be
fruitful and multiply.” God that landed in your bedroom to give you a helping
hand during the act of sexual intercourse will rain manna from heaven to cater
to the children when they arrive. Don’t even let your wife rest. Doesn’t she
belong to the other room? Few months after she delivers your triplets, fire her
again in that your room self-contain. She needs no rest. She’s the baby
factory. Your vision must be as large as a football team, with a robust reserve
bench at that. So, your wife must deliver enough children to make your dream
come true. Don’t worry about space. Your ‘face-me-I-face-you’ room is elastic.
It will expand as you give birth to more children.
Don’t listen to that nonsense they call family
planning? It’s what the enemies of progress have devised to cut short the ‘be
fruitful and multiply’ mandate. More so, you’re a Nigerian. Carry go.
Everything your children need to thrive from birth to adulthood is available.
Free education. Sound health care. Job opportunities. Adequate security. And
all that makes life sane and habitable. You need not worry. The Govt. has got
you covered. This rule is important. ‘Born’ them plenty. Your children must
surround your table (so, make a very long table), as well as your grave on the
day of your funeral.
After giving birth to them like plantain, make a list
of all your brothers’, uncles’, family members, and everyone you’ve ever helped
in this life. Ensure the list is comprehensive enough because you will have to
deploy every one of those children – that your well regulated sexual organs and
uncommon sense helped you bring to earth – to their various abode. You now nah.
On a NYSC level. Deploy them to their various place of primary assignment. If
your relative disagrees, wait till they visit your abode. Donate one of your
many children to them in goodwill.
Where it comes to parenting, you must also up your
game, either you have them in abundance or units; especially with the kind of
children, we have these days. Children shouldn’t be over-pampered o. First, you
must try as much as possible not to give your child(ren) one whole meat; no
matter their protein deficiency. That kind of treatment spoils children. Let
them share one meat if you have more than one child. That is a very cogent way
of showing them that life isn’t a bed of rose and disciplining them to be great
people tomorrow. Children with less meat to eat have more sense than children
with all the meats. Leave malnutrition, face home training. You as a parent,
gather all the meat into your storehouse. Feel free to take as much meat as you
can, at least four pieces for every meal, depending on how many are in the pot.
You need the protein. Don’t mind your body weight.
Also, as a Nigerian parent, you must magnify your
position beyond your responsibilities. Use your position as parents to subtly
control your children. Isn’t that the style of leadership of our colonial
masters? It is part of home training to call for your child on the tenth floor
to come to help you pick the TV remote that’s in front of you on the ground
floor. After all, parents give birth to children so that they can rest. It’s
not laziness, it’s exercising your fundamental parental rights. Shutting your
children up when they have things to say is part of it too.
Only spoilt children will speak when the elders are
talking. What an old primitive elder (that has refused to keep up with current
reality) can see from a stool he inherited from his grandfather, a young lad on
the Iroko tree cannot see. That’s why all these ‘small children’ shouldn’t be
given a place in the public service. They lack the experience. Long live the
old, primitive, and rugged, who have all the experiences to move the country
two steps forward and twenty-two steps backward. Movement is movement.
About flogging; you’ve not started parenting if you
cannot flog your children. Madness is in the heart of children; it must be
chased out with the rod. Ensure you leave them with scars so that they can
remember not to do it again. Don’t mind Nigerian drivers that won’t obey a
traffic sign. Their parents didn’t flog them well when they were young. Even
those that still throw pure water nylon inside the gutter, they didn’t receive
enough flogging. Don’t even talk about the public servants who are working so
hard to ensure poverty is evenly distributed in the land; they were not
flogged. It’s too stressful trying to think about other ways to instill
discipline into a child. Who needs to think about disciplining a child when
‘pankere’ and ‘koboko’ is nearby?
As a parent, you can’t afford to open your eyes and
watch these children get rotten. Can’t you see the way all those ‘yeah men’
children abroad have turned out to be because they were not properly flogged?
They call the cops on their parents when they see them exhibit negative traits.
Parent your children the African way, if you want them to stay sane. Those
abroad children are not sane. That’s why you can’t compare our educational
system and rate of our scientific and technological invention with theirs. We
were flogged well. They weren’t.
The last but not least, never allow your children to
marry from other tribes or religions. Abi what fellowship does garri have with
rice? Fight it to the ground. They must marry someone from your village. The
genealogy must be preserved. If they attempt to go on with the marriage, remind
them that you’re their parent. You cared, nurtured, and catered to them so that
they can serve you all their lives. Their life isn’t their own, you’re their
god; you gave it to them. You’re meant to be worshipped. It doesn’t matter if
you have never been there for them.
Let’s end with these additional instructions:
There is no crime in using your children’s school fees
to buy ‘aso ebi’. It shows how you value education. You have to satisfy
outsiders before taking responsibility at home. School can wait, ‘aso ebi’
cannot. If you don’t buy the ‘and co.’ clothe, heaven might fall and they’ll
not come to your party next time. It’s a do-me-I-do-you game; its best played
with your children’s school fees. You don’t have to have the money, borrow to
make the party organizers happy. Then, soak your garri in silence with the fine
‘aso ebi’ you just bought. Satisfy others at your own expense.
You can even use your children’s school fees to
organize your own very necessary party too. Especially if it’s the funeral of
your relatives, like your grandfather’s brother cousin in the village; the one
you have never seen in your life, not even in a picture. Call for a big party
so that the soul of the departed can smile at you. There is no gain in quietly
burying the dead? After all, the deceased was the last of the heads of the
family nah. He deserves some good final respect. It doesn’t matter what kind of
person he was to you. This is a family ritual. The burial must be a talk of the
town. After the burial, you can resume your water logged-mosquito infested one
room in Lagos, but let the village people know that you have arrived.
In conclusion, when parenting comes to your mind, just know that you have to raise the bar. There is no need for improvement. Just copy and paste the mentality that you were brought up with – the one responsible for all the sense you’ve been able to gather to date. Keep passing the torch.

Dear misogynists (and the closet ones too),https://punocracy.com/dear-misogynists-and-the-closet-ones-too/,2020-09-16T09:15:44+01:00,"By: Oladini Omotola
It is so unfair that there is an advocacy for the equality of both genders — particularly the female gender — in all areas of life. Why should women who have long been given the highest honour of being in charge of certain important matters pertaining to the kitchen and childbearing suddenly want more from life? How dare they demand the right to be seen and treated as equals? Such an ungrateful lot!
It does not matter that these advocates, who sometimes go by the fancy term ‘feminist’, do not want women to be bound by the ridiculous standards made by the society. Standards naively set by dead people-our ancestors- and upheld by not so naive individuals like me and you. All that matters is that feminists are on a mission to continuously paint men as the villain at all cost. No, they are not really interested in making life better for the female folk. They, the feminists, want women to own properties, choose their path and be whoever they choose to be, participate in public discourse and hold meaningful political positions.
If we let them do as they wish heavens know what they will set out to achieve next, be at the forefront of important world decisions? Now, you might think that the world ought to have paid attention when the then consul of the Roman republic, Marcus Porcius Cato said “If they (women) are victorious now, what will they not attempt?” According to the all-knowing Cato, “As soon as they (women) begin to be your equals, they will have become your superiors.” See why women should not be treated as equals? According to the misogynistic handbook of course.
No, the whole world has got it all wrong, misogynists do not hate women, far from it, why would one hate the being that helped bring you to the world and raised you, the ones that will give you heirs and raise them for you, and the ones that will make a home for you. No, misogynists love women as long as they know their place and accept that the position of leadership solely belongs to men-whether they earn it or not. Misogynists do not hate the women that do not challenge the status quo, women may do that which they please as far as they ask for permission, so long they say “may I, my lord’’ or “can I, my majesty”.
While you are trying to explain to the world that misogynists do not hate women even though your actions and utterances clearly point towards that direction, do not forget to chastise those that say “though we are sometimes unintentional accomplice, let us let to do better by unlearning the attitudes that undermine women.” And if they are male feminists, call them clout chasers, say that they only want the women for themselves. They truly do not care about the welfare of women.
When people are mourning the death of a female that decided to challenge the status quo, one that flourished in a male-dominated world, like the first female Nigerian combat pilot — Titilope Arotile — whose life was cut short by an accident, choose that period to ask the most important and stupid question on the misogynist’s list. Say something along the line of “instead of being at home with a husband, she is flying helicopter, this is what you get by the so-called gender equality advocacy.’’ If you do not say it at the most inappropriate time, how else will the world know that misogynists cannot stand women that dare to be more?
While people are trying to create a safe space for women to thrive, do not forget to make a crude comment about your opponent in a presidential race, say her only asset is her ‘woman card’ like the supreme leader of the Acirema did before becoming the number one citizen of Acirema or behave like the senator of the said giant of Acirfa, slap a woman in a sex shop just because she attempted to prevent the assault of another woman. Do it because you know that society will let you go. No one will apprehend you. Your status and reproductive organ have given you such right to do as you please.
Dear misogynists, take no head when women advocate for gender equality in all spheres of life, say that they are clamouring for superiority at the expense of the male gender. Continuously say that their movement is pushing for the narrative of female superiority and nothing else.  When a man rapes his wife, say that a man cannot rape his wife, her body belongs to him and him alone to do as pleases. Support the girl child marriage but send your male child to school, the female child will end up in the kitchen anyway. But vehemently refuse the services of a male doctor for your wife.  Simply ask for a female doctor.  Ask your female employee to get you coffee in the office while they are working, such constant interruptions will only be to their benefit. Also, do not forget to ask them to volunteer when it comes to serving snacks during meetings or office get together.
When they climb the ladder of success or progress at work, attribute their success to their sex appeal, how else would they have achieved such feat when they are supposed to be in charge of your coffee during office break hour?  Dear misogynists, do not kick against gender bias, why else should you fight for or be bothered by a movement so alien? When confronted, give the flawed excuse of the weaker and smaller vessel, say that equality should be based on strength and size, and conveniently forget that not all men will be bigger than all women, based on this analogy demand that the smaller sized men be denied access to opportunities on the account of their stature. The world doesn’t discriminate against you why should you care?

Skimpy blouse, navel-on-fire-but-please-don’t-touch?
Bumshorts gripping your backside in a fist of bulbous
skin?
Right?
Brown skin girl, clap for yourself.
Brown skin flaunting herself while sashaying past a
terrace of signposts which read, in resplendent crimson, BEWARE OF DOGS!
Of course, you weren’t carrying a sign that read:
DOGS, RAPE ME.
Or perhaps you’ve forgotten you’re dealing withrealdogs.
Growling dogs, hair stiff like bristles.
You’ve forgotten the Dogible says, in Tenet 17 Verse
4:
A patch of female skin fills the [dog’s] head with
rousing images.
I’m sorry dogs raped you, though, but next time, wear
clothing that uncompromisingly conceals you. By uncompromising clothing, I mean
hair masks, face masks, long-sleeves, flappy skirts that swallow your legs like
the shark swallowed Jonah.
I emphasise: blindfold yourself. Sexy eyes drive dogs
mad! Trust your mind to guide you instead. (Dogible 1:43—The true eye is the
mind.)
Hide your nose too—the hair in your nostrils could
harden dogs’ penises, in case you don’t know!
Look for a way to stitch your lips together, because if your voice stirs their blood, you’re gone!
—
—you went out at NIGHT, right?
I keep telling you: you’re a woman.
A potential mother.
A wife in the making. Not a cat scurrying at night.
A woman should always remain indoors. In fact, she
should hammer multiple latches onto her door and use reallyblindwindow-blinds. There’s hardly light, and the heat at night can be searing?
Woman, would you rather shove yourself into the claws of a dog lurking outside?
As for those claiming they’re raped in their houses,
do you people bother asking whether they sleep or sit right?
You’re a woman, yet you lie on your back and throw
your legs apart. And when you sit, you open your legs for your vagina to do the
invitations.
Sit right, no.
Sleep right, no.
Tie your wraps right, no.
But when dogs invade your houses and the ‘patch of female skin’ stimulates them, you meow about being raped!
—
—you went to HIS HOUSE, didn’t you?
Brother Ezekiel is a childog of God. God is
withholding the blood flowing into his penis.
So you were sitting on his bed, cackling so hard that
your skirt slipped and revealed a large ‘patch of female skin’, and you
expected him to look away. (Dogible 22:6—[as a dog] ignoring a woman served
before you on a platter of gold is ultimate cowardice.)
And now, you want to call the police?
Well, I suggest you try illiterate ones who can’t read
the Dogible, or the sergeant will flip to Tenet 7:22 and read:
A woman amid a crescent of dogs is offering herself as bread and wine.
—
—examine HOW you walk!
You these young women of nowadays.
You walk like snakes slithering through elephant
grass.
You twist and curl your body like a shameplant being
caressed.
You dim your eyes as if you’re threading a needle in a
smoky room.
You even wag your tongues like dogs licking children’s
butts.
What’s more, you smile all the time!
Let’s turn to Dogible 21:9—And the woman was
smiling, and the dog forced himself on her, for smiling…is invitation.
And now, you’re ranting on Twitter?
Well, thank God your followers have seen most of your smiling pictures. Thank God they know smiling, revealing your teeth, according to the Dogible, is nudity.
—
—you’re an UNAPOLOGETIC feminist!
Let’s open to Dogible 20. I read from verse one:
A feminist is any woman who thinks she can tame dogs.
Here’s what we’re told in verses two and three:
Feminism is the ideology [that] women are higher than
dogs/And to establish a feminiverse, all women shall have them [dogs]
castrated.
What about Tenet 16:9?
Dogthren, a woman exhibits those [feminist] traits
while you fold your arms? Hearken! The Lord shall gnash His teeth against you,
for you have committed the greatest sin.
Granted, you can argue feminism is equity of the
sexes, and not how the Dogible pictures it; but no Dogible scholar, myself
included, will listen to you unless you change that to equisexism.
Dogs will be happy with you if you do. No one wants to
hear anything femi- imposed on them.
Meanwhile, you can be a feminist without growling so
loud about it. There is private feminism, isn’t it, the type you practise
online, with an anonymous Facebook account, a silhouetted DP, a challenge-my-ideas-and-I-cut-off-your-prick
bio. Simple!
By the way, how many women are still being
disenfranchised?
How many women are still being bred for marriage and
denied formal education?
How many women are being raped without them first provocating
dogs?
Women, according to Dogible 5:77,
[are the] shoulders of the home, that is, the carrier
of the head [the man].
Verse seventy-eight admonishes:
Should any [women] not gain gratification from this [being the shoulders],let her be offered to hounds on heat.
So, my dear, tone it down.
You matter, but notthatmuch.
You were created equal, but God wasn’t high on hemp
when he made fingers unequal.
Power has shifted from the physical to the
intellectual, but you’d rather run to a man with bulging biceps than to a
bedraggled scarecrow spluttering Shakespeare.
Girls should not be bred to exclusively anticipate
marriage, but take it or leave it, marriage and motherhood were the sole
reasons for their creation. (Dogible 22:9—The Lord only sanctions [girls’]
thoughts about marriage.)
Women should sniff after their careers, but your children will be taught by the streets and grow up worse. (Dogible 66:7—Any mother doused in career raises orphans.)

—you RUDELY said NO!
You said no to a stray dog?
Worst of all, yourudelysaid so?
You scrunched your face, flailed your hands, pouted
your lips, and said “NO!”, in uppercase, and an exclamation mark marched
out of your mouth???
Dogible 7:7 says,
Women revolve around the whims of dogs.
If you don’t understand that, then study this excerpt
from Dogadam’s magnum opus,Virility:
DOG:
Serve my food now!
WOMAN:
Yes sir!
DOG:
Please take this yelping toddler with you!
WOMAN:
Yes sir!
DOG:
And why are you giving me that look???
WOMAN:
Sorry sir.
(genuflects.)
DOG:
Maybe you’ve forgotten I paid your bride price with my
sweat.
WOMAN:
I remember sir. Sorry sir.
DOG:
Unless you want me to throw you out. I can remarry,
you see, but you, once you leave here, the badge of a failed marriage sticks on
you forever.
WOMAN:
(sobs)
Forgive me sir. Don’t throw me out!
Don’t you see how effortlessly Dogadam paints this scene of a peaceful marriage? If you follow Woman’s example, trust me, dogs can be nice, even romantic!

—WHY are you saying it NOW?
It was raining when he broke into your house.
You were sixteen then.
You tried to shout, but the rain masked your voice.
Even after it stopped raining, years tumbling past,
the rain was still masking your voice. And of course, you’d been too broken to
tell anyone, and you didn’t even know how to start.
Now, because a fellow idiot is advertising her rape
story to gain sympathy on Twitter, you decide it has stopped raining.
Now (that he’s successful and you’ve figured you could
benefit) is the time you feel powerful enough to talk about it.
#IWasAVictimToo!
#HeRapedMeToo!
I can smell your ignorance, so I keep supporting my
lesson with Dogiblical passages. Look at Tenet 3:30—
…for silence is the ultimate testament of agreement.
So, according to the Dogible, your silence means consent. Our people say if you swallow weevils, it means you chewed them first, so retching afterwards is hypocritical.
—
—dogs get raped TOO!
So why does your case even deserve special attention?
When a five-year old girl broke into a seventy-year
old dog’s house and raped him, who bleated on Twitter?
Did you not watch the clip where university girls
plunged a dildo into a dog’s butt and whacked him to silence?
You think there aren’t many undocumented stories
silenced by the long-standing tradition of dog supremacy?
Or aren’t there ordinary but significant occasions
such as:
i. women leering at dogs
ii. women caressing dogs’ collars
iii.  women
ruffling dogs’ furs
iv. women twirling dogs’ tails around their
forefingers
v. women squishing dogs’ balls in the bathroom
vi. women nuzzling dogs early in the morning?
I beg to argue that the above are instances of
forcible intercourse if you classify the following as forms of sexual
harassment:
i. a dog leering at you
ii. a dog whirling its tongue at you
iii. a dog touching your waist
iii. a dog threatening to rape you
v. a dog peering up your breasts
vi. a dog slapping your butt.
Finally, I advise you read your Dogible always. It’s
there to guide you, to teach you, to educate you, to make you a better woman.
Any questions?
Ask, please. I have other classes to teach.

The committee,https://punocracy.com/the-committee/,2020-09-16T09:02:53+01:00,"By: Ogunwale Emmanuel
There were seven bottles on the table. Six were opened. Two untouched. Making it eight. Did I say they were seven? Make it eight.
There
were eight rows on the table. And nine chairs. There should have been eight
chairs but the fat woman took up two chairs all on her own. Three actually, but
the unofficially official estimate was two. No one dared mention that out loud,
of course. No one even dared tell her she was “plus sized”, for the  obvious reason that no one wanted to lose
their jobs. As you can surmise, she was the boss.
And you know what they say. Never anger a fat person, their rage is…weighty.
Anyways, there are eight bottles, unofficially-officially nine chairs and six men round the table. The mood is tense. The air staler than “na today, oga. I swear” bread. Everyone was edgy and tense. Except the thin man. But he didn’t count. Once, when counting the number of people present, he actually excluded himself, would you believe it? Himself! So he wasn’t worried, partly because he felt he was too good to share their problems and also because he didn’t count. The chances of him contributing was… slim.
Someone
clears her throat at the far end.
“The problem,” the throat clearer announced solemnly, “is that we think there is a problem. Hence, the problem.”
Silence, already an active player in this passive meet, doubled down even further, following this apocryphal statement. Everyone turned to face the throat clearer. It was Mullah “Muller”. The famous three term senator. A man with enough clout and enough venerated dignity to knowingly say this and not have it dismissed as nonsense but actually high wisdom. Once he said solemnly “The terrorists hiding in our hair, we must comb them out!” and everyone nodded and cheered. No one considered the weighty allegation and lie put against lice there. But that is a story for another day.
After Muller made his statement, the silence of the committee took on an introspective stance. You could say they all… mulled over it.
“But if we don’t think there is a problem, how can we then solve it? Your thinking is strange, Senator,” replied Rogba.
Former military man. Man of steel. Ice. Man of stone. His relationship with Mullah had always been a bit… rocky.
“I am not saying we do not have a situation at hand, but calling it a problem makes it one,” Muller responded.
“Enough nonsense. Does a problem cease to be a problem because we change its name?”
“No.
But by calling it a problem, we are creating an issue out of this issue.”
“So
you think this situation is not a problem? Ha!”
“The
very act of you calling it a problem is my problem, senator.”
“Gentlemen,
please!” the fat woman finally croaked. Spoke. “Enough pandering. We know what
is at hand and no amount of grammatical grandiloquence will save us. So let’s
discuss way on how to get out of this mess!” And she punctuated that sentiment
by releasing a loud merciless fart, which everyone studiously ignored.
Silence, like an on-rushing river filled the place again. This time, an unsure one.
The not-so-thin man, two chairs and three bottles away from the thin one perked up. He knew the problem. He had solutions. Now was the time. He cleared his throat and was about to tal—
“We’ve been focused on the wrong issue all along,” the elderly statesman to the left of the right hand man of the fat woman stentorianly said.
“We have been tackling the wrong thing. The real issue here is how to tackle this issue.”
A rumbling assent greeted this pronouncement.
“We must face this issue headfirst. That is the only—”
“Hold it, hold it. Head first? Nonsense,” Mullah said. “Who doesn’t know a sensitive problem of this magnitude is best viewed from the side?”
“You are all looking at it the wrong way,” Rogba rumbled. The not-so-thin man perked up, hopeful.
“Front? Side? Rid-diculous! The only proper way to resolve this is to workbackwards. Only the inner can truly fix the outer.”
He
looked around for support. He expected some introspection. He waited for the
applause. It never came. He was still a bit too young and too poor for his
nonsense utterings to be hailed as wisdom. Or perhaps even this committee could
only take enough stupidity.
“Nonsense.”
“Rubbish.”
“Inside
outside? I had never heard such a thing without a good meaning.”
Chaos.
Turmoil. The fat woman croaked to no avail. Spoke. Shouted actually.
The not-so-thin introvert gave up talking again, for the 12thtime.
“Order.
Order!” the fat woman croaked for the 34thtime in the space of
three minutes. Spoke.
This
time, they listened.
She
glanced at the time. 49 minutes gone. Today was up.
“Clearly, you gentlemen representing your districts on this issue are full of impassioned grit and steely determination. I can see all of us are ready to truly solve this err…err…thing. Very commendable. Although I would love nothing more but to listen to you all, our one hour is however almost up. If there is no other issue err… Shall we adjourn?”
“Yes.”
“Let’s.”
“We’ll
definitely get down to solving it next time.”
“Slow
and steady wins the race.”
And
so ended the thirteenth meeting on the issue no one really knew anything about
but all agreed was important.
They had made tremendous progress, these dignitaries and senators. First they had established the problem was not a problem but an issue, outlined ways to approach tackling the problem which was not a problem, but a problem, and established confidence in their ability to solve… it.
And
the historians wondered why the country was the greatest in Africa.
The end.
Well, this is the part where I reel out my achievements, interests, hobbies and all those things that make me a cultured Nigerian. Problem is, I don’t have anything interesting to say. Or the finesse to say it. I’m an intellectual agbero. I love book, breasts, anime, Nietzsche and Arsenal. And the only thing I want to do in this life is tell a frigging good story. That’s all."
#NotAllMen: A guide on how to decimate Twitter feminists,https://punocracy.com/notallmen-a-guide-on-how-to-decimate-twitter-feminists/,2020-09-15T12:22:30+01:00,"By: Obinna Tony-Francis Ochem
Are you a man? Are you tired of feminists? Most
especially tired of twitter feminists? Do they rope all men together to drive
an agenda? I am sure you know the word, ‘agenda’ is rife on Twitter. The latest
phrases are ‘agenda people’ and ‘agenda people must agend.’
When feminists want to call out problematic men, they
tweet or say ‘Men’, but you as a man is tired of being held accountable. After
all, you protect women from other men. How dare they not be appreciative of
you? Men are God’s given gift to earth. You are an alpha male, don’t mind those
male allies, they are nothing but ass lickers and beta males. Don’t cower to
their level, you are more than gassing twitter misandrists. Yes, they are
misandrists. Nothing else.
“Men are trash,” she tweets. You scroll
through your timeline, your glance catches the tweet, it makes you sad. You
think, “Look at you. I am different from all men. I don’t rape
women,” then you stop, brushes it off. It doesn’t matter if you rape or
harass women, or if you are a Misogynist. What matters is that you are on
twitter where no one knows you. Don’t allow them to rope men together. It is
not all men, you yell, before typing all your caustic words.
Before you type those caustic words, do you think
twitter feminists will dignify you with a response? You want them to get hurt
when you tweet, so they will reply to you? And you scream a win for Patriarchy
FC. Patriarchy FC always on the lead. Here are the little guide to follow.
You log in to Twitter, a tweet pops on your timeline.
Another girl had been raped. Men are getting bashed. A twitter feminist tweets
that this is the reason why she hates men, listing all the crimes men have
perpetrated toward women. Under the thread, there would be fellow women and
male allies making her point. There will be people like you, making an
incoherent argument for your fellow men, talking about, “Not All
Men”.
Take a deep breath, ignore them, tweet about your
brother who was raped by a woman. If you don’t have a brother, talk about other
men. Create a fairy tale. I will recommend you read more of Stephen King
literature. After all, Chinụa Achebe
became the father of African literature by writing fiction.
After that, make up statistics, to talk about how all
young boys had been harassed by female housemaids, in as much, most Nigerian
households don’t have a housemaid. Mothers acted as a maid. Do it, then you
will see feminists getting rattled by your tweets. You have given yourself an A
in Gaslighting 101.
Do you know what Whataboutism means? Google it, my
friend. When a feminist, tweets about women, bring out the theory. Watch them
get rattled.
If you can’t do the first one, become a male feminist.
When you join twitter, the first thing to put on your bio is feminist, before
you list the football club you support, then finally adds God-lover. This
doesn’t mean anything. You can even call yourself King of Feminists. After all,
women can’t fight for themselves like you have been taught, Patriarchy needs
the input of men. Take up space. Educate women. Tell them to become
Feminist-lites and stop making Feminism hate against men. When they make a
hasty generalisation, tell them this is why most men don’t want to identify as
Feminists. She will have to rethink. You know, without male inputs, feminism
would not have been a thing. All the waves of Feminism meant nothing.
When you call yourself King of Feminism, destroyer of
Patriarchy, you can sneak in flavour of Misogyny, then some of your
feminist-lite women will hail you, or make excuses for you. All hail their
king. At that, start masterclasses, on menstruations, on female reproductive
health. You will be hailed for ensuring female cleanliness.
Why am I telling you all these? So, when they tweet,
Men, you can invade their mention, saying Not All MEN. They will listen. All
hail the saviour of women.
This is the best selling stuff. Establish your
account, start tweeting violence at women. When people ask you why the account
was established, tell them because it’s to counter misandry. Because they are
oppressing you. They want men extinct. Men’s only crime is violence against
women, rape against women, etc, you think it does not warrant the male slander
all over the timeline.
A part of bro-code said bro should not listen to
b*tches. You know bros’ are meant to listen to broses only. Alaye no fall bros
hands. Tell them women should stop holding men accountable. You only listen when
a fellow man gives advice. Don’t you remember when there are hot takes on
Twitter, some men tag, Ogbenidipo to give his two cents? Yes. Because only men
should advise men. Or  Kevin Odanz and
Oloye, they are experts. They are the chief, learn from them to boost your
Misogyny CV.
Before you created a twitter account, you must have
read about Ozzy, her tweets all over social media? From Facebook, WhatsApp
status, and Instagram. Since you are a man, you should have seen her from your
fellow men, bashing her.
She is too soft. Her assistant is Kiki Mordi. Ignore
that one. She is not soft like Ozzy, except after you have built your audience,
and can face her squarely with supports.
Face Ozzy. When she tweets anything about her son,
twist it to fit your narrative. Not any narrative, the narrative that will make
your male followers insult her. To say she doesn’t know what Feminism is all
about. To say she hates men. Keep tweeting at her. While at that, be one of her
twitter followers. Don’t care if she follows back. Once she tweets, jump to
attack until she blocks you.
Then you have made it.
There are two types: Satire and Satirical Misogynist.
— Satire: When you come across a video where a man
rescued a young girl, tweet, “ah, men are trash. Why did he rescue
her.” Then add angry emoji. Your followers will understand the point you
are trying to make. Even if it’s dumb. It doesn’t matter if an older woman
could have done the same to a younger boy. It reinstates men as saviours, not trash.
When there is a video of male armed robbers
apprehended by men. Tweet, “Look at that, inequality in terms of security
and protection.” Your fellow men will litter all over your tweet. They
will understand. Those women are two-faced hypocrites.
—Satirical Misogynist: You tweet about women’s
struggles, thanking God you are not a woman, then tell your fellow men to tweet
why they are thanking God they are not women. Mockery emojis littered all over
your tweets. When a feminist calls you out, call it satirical Misogyny.
*Inserts feeling cute emoji”
Here, you don’t want to be anything. You have your
main account, but created a burner account because you are tired of political correctness
people, social justice warrior leftists, etc. You barely have more than a
hundred followers.
Your twitter avatar, is a picture of Lord future, a random man or a woman because you don’t want anyone to know who you are. Most of the time, your tweet is under “See More.” Your whole tweet is on dragging, bodyshaming, and insulting women. Don’t stop. When you feel most of the twitter Feminists have blocked you, deactivate and create a new one. Lord Future will be proud of your hustle, after all, Misogyny is a personal trait.

How to be a Nigerian parent,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-nigerian-parent/,2020-09-15T11:52:09+01:00,"By: Mojoyinoluwa Kofoworola Agbonde
God has blessed your marriage with children. Blessed is the Nigerian parent who has his quiver full of children, he who does not have can go and die.
Now
that you are a parent, discard every pet name you called your spouse before the
arrival of your first child. How can you be calling your husband by his first
name after you have made him a father? Do you want people to question the
paternity of the child? Daddy Bola would be better.
It
is your desire to have both males and females. The females are the toughest to
train but since you have been blessed with them, there is no going back. When
you see them developing, warn them to avoid boys like a plague but when they
are almost thirty years old and you are tired of buying other people’saso
ebi,make them attend Shiloh programmes.
I
must warn you to never talk to your girl child about sex. It is when she knows
about it that she would want to experiment. Do not talk to her about
menstruation, when it comes she would know. There is no need to rush. It is a
sin for her to call her private parts their actual names. Teach her to call her
vagina ‘plasma’, ‘my nana-nana’ and ‘the New Jerusalem’.
When
you are delivered of a boy, let your joy know no bounds. It means that you do
not have to worry about him getting pregnant prematurely or being raped when
armed robbers break into your house. The only thing that should irk you most is
his sisters including his name in the roster for cleaning the house. A man
should not sweep. Scold him when he cannot kill snakes, shows his fears or
cries. The penis between his legs is for courage.
Tell
him that he is entitled ten times to every one opportunity that the girl gets.
This is how you should do it, when he comes home with a second position, if the
first is a boy like him, wipe away his tears and say that it is not the end of
the world. Let the volcano inside of you erupt if it is a girl. A woman should
not beat him in class. A woman who bends to urinate? You cannot be paying
through your nose to have another man’s daughter come out on top.
Stress
it that any boy who is an assistant to a girl class captain is a potential
woman wrapper. A man is the head of the family and automatically the head of
the class.
The
kingdom of children suffereth violence and the violent parent taketh it by
force. When visitors give your children money during festive periods, snatch
the money away from them before the visitor steps outside your door. When they
ask for a refund, ask them if you have ever asked for a refund of their daily
allowance. They would not give you an immediate answer but do not worry, their
memories are like sandy soil.
As
a Nigerian parent, you have to think that it is stupid for any girl to say that
she was raped. When you hear the case of any Uwa that was raped and killed,
warn your daughters in the university not to go and read in the church. When
you hear of any Jennifer that was raped by her biological father, send them
broadcasts on WhatsApp on how they should not wear shorts at home because it
causes domestic rape. Rapists are not the cause of rape I assure you. Her large
hips are the demons.
Do
not tell your children that you cannot afford their excursion fees. Tell them
gory tales of road accidents, the Sosoliso airplane crash of 2005 with Loyola
Jesuit College students in it and the Dana airplane crash of 2012.  When they try to cover the road and skies
with the blood of Jesus just so you can let them go, yell at them and like imps
they will flee. It is not because you do not have the money. It is because you
do not want to lose your children to death.
Your
children’s greatest achievement in life is to go abroad. Abroad can be anywhere
as long as it is not in Africa with the exception of South Africa. When they
finally get to travel, tell them to never come back to Nigeria. You are
patriotic.
Set
rules that your children must know when to 
turn on and turn off like switches. Let them speak mother tongues to you
at home but when visitors are around, they should have the sense to speak
Queen’s English. They should speak English to your illiterate driver but speak
Igbo to you the educated one. They do not have to prostrate to you at home but
when you have friends around, they should do so quickly.
No
child of yours must go to the Arts and Humanities department. Only dullards go
to the Arts class. Kindly forget your child’s subject weaknesses or hatred for
blood and chemicals, when he gets to the Sciences, a miracle would happen. Arts
students are dull but Law students are intelligent.
There
is only one profession in the Commercial department which is Accounting. The
only profession in the Arts is Law. There are only two courses in the Sciences:
Medicine and others.
When
your child wants to fill in her J.A.M.B form, let her first choice of
institution be the University of Ibadan or the University of Lagos even if she
has slim chances of attaining high scores. If you are skeptical about your
child’s ability to score good marks, choose a private university instead. When
you are asked why you chose a private institution instead of a public one like
Obafemi Awolowo University, say that it is because you do not like how public
universities go on incessant strikes like you yourself did not graduate from
one of them. If after five years, your child is still studying a four-year
course in the University of Lagos and her friend bags a first class degree in
Engineering from Babcock University, hiss and say that she bribed her way
through.
Learn
not to paddle your own canoe. Criticize your brother, Femi Otedola, for letting
his daughter be a disc jockey. Insult your colleague, Femi Falana, for allowing
his son to be a musician. However, when your son decides to toe the same path,
slap him and twist his ears. He must not do that which you are dissuading
others from doing.
It is important that you know people— a.k.a ogas at the top, alias connections. Your present network of friends determines how fast your children would get to their promised land. You need connections to get them to the admissions list, to help them evade queues, to get them jobs and contracts.
You
cannot be anti-social media. It is not allowed. Facebook should be your
strength. Facebook never lies. It tells you who has travelled abroad, who has a
big house or not. Send daily good morning images to your children on WhatsApp
even though you live together. Send them heavy videos but raise eyelids when
their data bundles finish. You are not plucking money on trees.
There
is something you must never be and it is that you must never be a racist. You
must not be a racist but you can be a fanatic. Over your dead body should your
children attend Christian schools. They could end up being converted. However,
when you do, let your children wear hijabs against the school rules. You the
Christian should retaliate by dressing your children up as choristers. If you
are a Christian and your son’s best friend is an unbeliever, you have failed.
What has light got to do with darkness?
There
is something you must never be and it is that you must never be a racist. You
must not be a racist but you can be a tribalist. Do not let your children marry
Hausas, they are too dirty. Igbos? They are too greedy. Yorubas? Too fetish.
Let them marry from your tribe only. Your tribe is the best.
Finally,
talk about DNA test like it is a test that every ₦18,000
₦30,000 minimum wage
earning family can afford. Talk about In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and adoption
like they are ABC to people who do not have children of their own. However,
remember to pray against your descendants having to do them. The God who gave
you children will give them children too. Amen.

Danfo: What it is,https://punocracy.com/danfo-what-it-is/,2020-09-14T08:14:29+01:00,"By: Melody
A Danfo is a clumsy tailored commercial shuttle popularly identified by its yellow colour and black stripes. It is widely associated with Lagos, a cosmopolitan city and it ranges from four seaters to six seaters depending on the size of the bus.
A Danfo is usually marked by its incompleteness, if it has a side-mirror, it most likely has a broken windscreen; if it has a windscreen it most likely has no side mirror, front mirror or even, a missing chair replaced by a kitchen stool, or a dangling seat belt like the measuring tape on a tailor’s shoulder.
The Danfo was perhaps born out of the passage of old rickety ‘Molue’. Its structure takes its form from metal and has oftentimes been panel-beaten by its reckless users to retain its shape from constant bashing.
Like a cargo container with tires, a Danfo would accommodate all creations alike and unalike; the bold, the bad and the ugly,  the screamers who would always find something to scream about, the sleepers who would sleep on other people’s shoulders causing discomfort and pity at the same time, the arguers who always have something to say about the government, the thieves who board buses to gain back their transport fare with some profit, the politicians who know other politicians but don’t have money for election, and most importantly the animals; goats, chicken, rams etc who also have their rights to uphold at the back end of the bus. A Danfo could therefore be likened to a dummy representation of Nigeria; crazy and clueless. Its language nothing short of eccentric and savage.
Searching for comfort in a Danfo, you should never miss the seat by the window. While this may bestow on you the comfort you desire, it could also be the most risky place to be when an accident occurs. So the question on your mind when you enter a danfo should be “Would I rather die from an accident or die of some odoriferous emission from my neighbours?” Whichever way, the risk is yours to take but then what is life in Lagos without risks… risk it mehn!!
The Danfo is a cocktail of joy and sadness, a happy tragedy or a tragi-comedy. Though it’s not always a party in a Danfo, it is never a dull moment.
I am a simple girl from the southern part of Nigeria. I write to experience life twice; in reality and in retrospect."

certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her
address and expressions or the word will be but half-deserved.”
—Caroline Bingley, in “Pride
and Prejudice.
At 28 years old, my greatest accomplishment is being a virtuous, well-mannered lady. Everyone attests to it. “She’s a role model, you should try being like her,” my neighbours tell their children. Young women stop me in the street asking me to mentor them, “My mum is always talking about how amazing you are, I’ll like to be you. At least she’ll be proud of me.” I was fully convinced of this the day my old principal called my dad to ask him to grant me permission to come give a talk to the girls on‘Navigating This Treacherous World As A Woman While Holding Tight To Your Virginity’in my alma mater, especially with the surge in the incidence of rape cases. I have a master’s degree in Bioinformatics and currently studying for my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology while working in a senior role in a firm in Enugu. My greatest accomplishment, however, was what my father granted me permission to talk about – my virtue.
To further reach more
women and create a battalion of virtuous women across the nation, I am sending
this out, for that will make the world safer for women if they learn how to be
well-mannered. It is anonymous because a demure lady does not call attention to
herself, she does not ask for credit for her work, and she definitely does not
need to be celebrated regardless of how groundbreaking, inspiring and
educational her works might be. That’s the first lesson, dear woman, you must
seek to be erased. In fact, you must be complicit in your erasure.
So, here we go. Your
lessons, woman.
1a)Your guiding principle in whatever you do is that in comparison to men, you are the weaker sex. Learn this, inculcate it in whatever you do, and you are well on your way to glory. On this path, you will realise boys will always be boys, and for this, you have to cut them some slack. Their every decision will undoubtedly have an influence or be influenced by you and it is utterly impossible to hold them accountable. It is not in their nature. Therefore, you will have to be accountable for their actions.
1b)You are the weaker sex, and so for the stronger sex to show how much he loves you, he will hit you. If he loves you, he punches you. He will lord over you. This is why you must learn how to calm a man down. It is a survival skill you need. Bearing the responsibility of being superior often comes with anger management issues. It is your duty to help manage a man’s temper for him, and you need to learn this to survive.
2a)Your dressing is important, you must learn how to go about it. You must not show too much skin, for that isashawobehaviour. You might get raped for that and it will be all your fault. You must not cover everything up like a prude, else you won’t attract a man, and who will marry you then? You might also get raped for that and it will be your fault for not allowing men to see any part of your body, you tease. Balance is the key, aspire to it, woman. The trick is to be eye candy but not too distracting. Wear makeup but not too much, else you’ll tempt them. You are not to make men sin like that. They are the leaders, the better gender, the sovereign, and you – a mere lesser-than-equal being – should not use your body to distract them from doing the back-breaking work of upholding the patriarchy. It is easy for us women, but men have it so hard. Very hard. All the time. And it’s pure physiology, I tell you. It cannot be helped. That is why they occasionally grope and sexually assault you in schools, in public transport, and even in religious houses. It’s nothing personal, really. What you’re wearing does not matter. Anyways, it is only occasional, get over yourself.
2b)More than makeup, grooming is important for a woman. Shave your legs, your armpits, your vagina. Nobody likes a bush down there, get rid of it. Wax and oil your lady parts, be smooth like a baby’s back. Body hair, acne, and stretch marks are not sexy. There’s a whole industry dedicated to your beauty, for you to achieve wholesome femininity, even make you lighter and more desirable. Be thankful for its existence and make use of it. Focus on your goals – pleasing men. Never mind that men do not need to do all that. Hairy chests are sexy. Unwashed boxers have a strong masculine smell. Be sure to stick your nose up their hairy armpits and crotch, it is guaranteed to arouse you. Be grateful for it.
3)It is well known and scientifically proven that women are at their best in nurturing roles. It is the reason women birth children, not men. Men are better suited to roles allowing them to assert their dominance. They are designed to be tough and aggressive. The responsibility of earning a living is on their shoulders – not an easy burden to bear. Hegemonic masculinity asks you to be content in your easy domestic role as a child-bearing home keeper, and not expect men to help in taking care of their own children. The bible,1 Timothy 2:12,asks you to bear it in silence and not usurp his authority. Do not blaspheme God by asking him to do things that are feminine, and out of the scope God intended.
4)Now, you must learn to care for your distant relatives. You know, those ones always putting their mouths in your business. Never mind that they are always talking about how you should cut your afro or walk with your back straight, so you’ll be perfect for marriage. Never mind that they keep saying getting an education is a colossal waste of time and money and you’d do better marrying the Londoner down your street. After all, you have light skin and so not very different from a proper London girl, you know, so you won’t be upsetting his palates. Never mind all that, it is not your duty to. Once you get your first salary at work, make sure you send it all to them, that is your duty. They will split it among themselves and pat themselves on the back for a job well done. Afterall, ojú méjì ló ń bímọ, ìgbà ojú ló ń wò.
5)On inheritance, never expect anything. Female children do not inherit properties. Even if you are given anything, you must accept it gracefully and hand it over to your brothers or husband for management. There’s no way you’d know how to manage things like that, even with your degrees. Anyway, your father’s house is not your house, your husband’s house is. Although you cannot inherit your husband’s either. His family members have a higher right to claim things you both have built over the years. This is all so straightforward, you’ll find out when you get a husband – that is, if anybody deigns to marry you with your unrelaxed, unstraightened mop of hair. You wouldn’t want to be estranged from your family members because of mere properties, after all, ènìyàn láṣọ. I mean, you’ll need a place to go when your husband hits you before sending you out of the home.
6)Lastly, dear woman. You need to know that feminism is propaganda sold by 30+ women who have had their hearts broken – because of their stubbornness – and do not have any prospects for marriage. Sure you would not want to be identified as that. You are young and have your whole life ahead of you. Even more, men do not like feminists. It is a totally unnecessary agenda. What is the matter that the values of misogyny are constantly being perpetuated, even legally? You do not need equal pay. In the unlikely event that your husband allows you to work, men are the head of the family, and they shoulder all the bills. What, then, do you need equal pay for? Also, you do not need not to be objectified, a woman’s worth is in how much she is desired. And you definitely have no business being president. You have no business breaking glass ceilings.

The legal way to do yahoo yahoo in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/the-legal-way-to-yahoo-yahoo-in-nigeria/,2020-09-14T08:02:21+01:00,"By: Malik Kolade
Before you start jotting things down, understand that when I am talking aboutYahoo Yahooin Nigeria, I am not talking about the riff-raffs who depend on $25 iTunes or Amazon gift cards from one John Doe in Casablanca or those who use $1 million to buy a Morris Minor – one car like that from the future. I am also not talking about the ones who end up in the garden of SARS and bribe their way out with N10,000. Never, not those small fishes wriggling in the ocean. Those ones are mediocre, and because we don’t celebrate mediocrity in Nigeria, we can never be proud of them.
When I am talking aboutYahoo Yahooin Nigeria, I am talking about the Sharks of the Ocean.
The ones that dupe their clients in broad daylight and still get away with it.
The ones whose legitimate act of fraud, swindle, and money wire is constitutionally
backed up. The ones we are always proud of, the all times golden sons of the
soil. The ones who don’t cash out through Money Gram or Western Union, rather
the ones thatna FBI dey escort their
cash out inside bullion van.
But if you still do not understand those I am referring to, then two things might have happened, one is maybe I haven’t called them names likeShinzu Money,Spending The Picker,Jacuzzi The Loaderor other names you’re familiar with. The second is maybe I am a fool, because only a fool writes in a simple language another man will not comprehend. But if you grab my description, then below is the almighty formula for The Legal Way To DoYahoo YahooIn Nigeria and get away with it.
Firstly, because it is unlike the illegal Yahoo where
you can just wake up one day and use your phone or laptop tobomb sitesto get clients, you have to
start from the basic. I mean from the days ofGreatest Nigerian Students; Great! Greatest Gbagba; Gbagba! Greatest
Gbogbo; Gbogbo! Greatest Shiwon; Shiwon!You have to start from those days
because you need that background knowledge. Forget studying it in the
University, field experience matters, and the only way to get that is through
Aluta Continua, Victoria Ascerta. But if you use silver spoon to eat in your
house, you don’t need this stage, it is a stressful one and I am certain Chief
Adigun Olowolayemo would have used money to buy that stressful process for you.
The second stage is the internship. This stage is extremely important and tricky. Here you have to play your cards well because you are no longer dealing with the Professors and Emeritus whom you will be paying their salaries later on. You are now dealing with the big fishes and you have to be careful not to get swallowed. If that happens, it means thetiger squad don burst you be that,and your career may end with it. In this stage, you look for potential organizations where you will be able to practice what you have learnt in your Aluta days. And it’s not just any organization, but I will recommend those that can sweep Nigeria clean or those under whose shade you can hide when it rains.
This stage is also where your field experience will be useful because it will make your CV stand out. And when your internship is finally approved, your work begins. Engage in their struggle with and for them, be at the center stage (if possible) or better still, be the liaison officer between them and those Baby-Comrades who are still in the Aluta Struggles. With that, you have a strong foothold, and if eventually the struggle pays, you can remind them of how you fight e-wars for them and thus make demands in return. It may be a portfolio where all you do is being Special Assistant to His Excellency on Marital Affairs. Again, if you drink from oil wells, this stage is not for you, it is profile diminishing, one not befitting your status. Besides, Alhaji Danladi Abubakr would have used power to buy that stage for you.
The third stage is when you start to cash out. This stage is when your father’s oil well or the money you have parted with serving as Commissioner for Petroleum Resources will play its part. Need I remind you that the cash out is not immediate and that you have to give the little cash out you have gotten to get more. You have to woo your clients with passion, make fake promises to them, and if possible, make the Yahoo a plus. I know you cannot have bloods on your hands but in your name, so with just 10 packets of Colorado and 5 bottles of Dry Gin, the responsible men will drool at your feet begging to do the job for you.
When all those are done, the next thing to do is
grease the palm of theyou-know-whos.
Well, for you that your father built your house with oil blocks, you don’t have
to bother so much about this, but if otherwise, you have to grease the palm
with everything you have. Believe me, it’s worth it. After all, your goal is to
be likeShinzu Moneyin White House
or Chief Nzeougu Nwafor in one penthouse in Ikorodu reading about DasukiGate
while gesturing to where the bullion van will park in his garage. For this
stage, the final thing to do is be a Polytheist. And except you don’t live in
Nigeria or you want me to spoon-feed you with every tip, then Iresist the urge to shalayewhy you must
do Polytheism.
For the final stage, I want you to understand that
everything you do matters, especially to your clients, even if it includes
giving them a token to buy their trust. Your clients are the formidable forces
who will put you where you will wire the money, so be in their good books. You
must also understand that your clients will not feed only on promises, so you
have to distribute Bursary, Award Scholarships, create Empowerment Programs and
do giveaways occasionally. Even if you have to break the bank, just do it. And
if you have carefully followed these steps without skipping any, then sit back
and relax, you have the next four years to cash out, accumulate your losses and
more, or when after you die, we give the process Machala Loots while we recover
your hard earned money in foreign currencies.
Now that I have given you the blueprint, I would have said that the ball is now in your court. But truthfully, except you want to do aYahoo Yahoowhere you don’t want to wire your cash out in bullion vans, the ball is not anywhere near your court because there is level to doing this kind ofYahoo Yahooin Nigeria.

(The gods are angry)
‘This and only this is the
way.’—psalms 500:4
I
In a soft polarized light,
let a new day break
upon an imaginary kingdom:
Umueze, Umuagu, Umuijele,
something similar, anything would
go.
A red-cap chief lounges
on a fallen roost of the iroko
tree—
though the fallen bough
of a mango tree would do.
He chews neem chewing-stick
while flicking fingers to
figure-out
deals for the day.
This is the exposition, light
must fade.
II
An ancient drum is the first to
peep,
followed by an ancient whistle,
and a soft opera sets the tone in
Igbo.
An ancient village, ancient
trees, ancient men,
a thatch house or a rusk-kissed
zinc roof.
A quaint looking priest, white
dye on
a single eye, a quill feather, an
ancient calabash.
Can you read the writing
crisscrossing
the walls of the thatch house?
Well, the gods are angry.
A riddle the length of a century,
an elder or chief or anyone laces
the cold morning breeze with
proverbs,
a toad does not run in the daytime
for nothing,
this is the falling action.
The gods are angry.
A virgin on a revenge mission,
she was murdered a long time ago
by two chiefs and one young man,
her blood cries in Amadioha’s
shrine.
Two chiefs on a sacred mission in
the shrine,
a séance perhaps. Amadioha needs
seven
young men the height of Odysseus,
Homer’s poetry can save a
blackout
where people journey to nowhere.
The gods are angry.
Seven young men to traverse
the forest with arrows, the evil
forest,
this is dangerous.
Death takes one then another,
goof by goof,
a lone man to come home.
The gods are angry.
Hit a gong at sunrise,
a princess for a prize,
this is the end.
Leave things this way,
this and only this is the way.
This is how to act a movie,
this is how to seal suspense,
not with a thrill but
a sigh that slants
across a familiar breeze.
III
If and only if the era is
technological,
stress it no further on spears
and arrows.
You might not also be needing
naval dolphins and exploding
donkeys.
This will amount to a splurge.
Just a gun that kills before
being
fired, a victim that falls before
a trigger
is yanked, a car that kills by
screeching
to a halt and a pistol that must
be propped
forward and jerked to take a
shot.
A gush of blood with
the delicate hue of an emulsion
paint adds intrigue and substance.
This is the end.
This and only this is the way.

Creating efficient healthcare systems: The Nigerian model,https://punocracy.com/creating-efficient-healthcare-systems-the-nigerian-model/,2020-09-13T10:57:14+01:00,"By: Kachi Martin Ebubedike
Humans succumb to infirmities throughout their lives. Even though they desire immortality, diseases ensure it forever remains elusive. This inordinate longing is evidenced by the huge resources wasteful nations spend discovering medicinal agents, gadgets and on building hospitals.
A nation of reasonable people simply enjoy life and accept their fate when God decides to punish their sins with sicknesses. If it is God’s will that a child should die of malaria, why should the government waste money on mosquito nets? If it is God’s will that a woman should die during childbirth, why squander resources on training doctors and midwives?
Financially prudent governments like that of Nigeria understand the frivolity of wasting huge resources on healthcare. This is why the president, in his infinite wisdom, decided to slash the healthcare budget amidst a pandemic so money can be spent on renovating the national assembly complex. The nation’s lawmakers surely need a heavenly edifice to heal the sick and save lives.
This decision should serve as a model for unwise nations that build laboratories hospitals and fund research to fight Covid-19. The manner in which they waste resources on discovering vaccines and treatment for this disease is at best a case of misplaced priorities. Worse still, it is a blasphemy for trying to treat a disease God approved to purge Nigeria of her sinful citizens.
Furthermore, other nations that offer healthcare professionals ridiculous remuneration packages should borrow a leaf from the Nigerian model. Why pay their salaries promptly when you can teach them the virtue of patience by withholding it? How will they become patriotic if they don’t work without pay? They will derive a huge sense of fulfilment for working for free which salaries cannot offer them. Money is indeed not everything. Medicine is a noble and altruistic profession which salaries can desecrate.
The Nigerian strategy of minimizing wastage by cutting salaries of healthcare workers has paid off immensely. The current diversification to other specialties of medicine like farming and tailoring. The consultants in tailoring have become renowned for sewing great burial suits for weak Nigerians who survive ordinary diseases like Covid-19. On the other hand, the new consultants in farming produce the partyjollofrice for their funeral. Still, a third group is exported to developed nations to help stabilize their fledgling healthcare system in a great humanitarian effort.
The massive success of the Nigerian healthcare policy is proven by the huge foreign exchange it earns from medical tourism. Stories of the numerous ultramodern hospitals spread across the nation has made Nigeria the preferred destination for seeking world class healthcare. The world-famous facilities attract the political elite, business leaders and royals from around the world. It is not uncommon to find a foreign president on a Nigerian hospital bed, clinic or laboratory.
In addition to these, a major innovation of the education ministry is the procurement of ancient laboratory equipment and specimens for training of healthcare professionals. This stimulate the ingenuity of the trainees as they improvise and invent new ways of using the equipment. The carpentry and electrical skills they learn while maneuvering them distinguish them from their peers around the world. The carpentry skills eventually help those that will become orthopedic surgeons while the electrical skills help the vascular surgeons in connecting blood vessels. Modern learning facilities make lazy Nigerian youths lackadaisical in their studies, thus the archaic ones were bought to help unlock their creativity.
In the pharmaceutical industry, the liberal approach to the regulation of food and drug production has been acclaimed by the world governing bodies as the future of healthcare. This approach enables non-pharmacists to produce drugs and make massive profits, boost the bank accounts of health inspectors and make many Nigerians to be gone too soon. When aMama Putpay her dues to the dutiful regulating officials, she will be allowed to garnish healthyegusisoup with houseflies and sneeze into her hands to make smootheba.However, she must prepare the meals with such recipe in a hidden kitchen, else public eyes render it unhealthy.
The last strategy is to create a health insurance scheme and make sure only those whose lives are worth saving are signed up to it. The rest shall derive satisfaction from paying from their pockets. Footing their own bills, especially for debilitating illnesses, help them attain poverty status. This ensures that Nigeria maintains her enviable position as the poverty capital of the world. After, transfer the health insurance funds to private bank accounts of political leaders to safeguard it for their unborn grandchildren.
To develop efficient healthcare systems, other nations should follow the tried and tested Nigerian model: slash healthcare budget to avoid wastage, pay healthcare workers with motivational speeches, cease unnecessarily stringent regulation of food and drug production and store health insurance funds in private bank accounts for safety.
I am a fourth year medical student at the University of Benin who is on a mission to build efficient healthcare systems for Nigerian using technology, fueled by the disdain I feel at the horrible state of Nigerian health systems. In addition to this, I am an essayist, a poet and a blogger who uses his literary skills to promote   African cultures. In my free time, I watch and play football and read self-help books."

Achieving success as a Nigerian musician: A practical guide on how to blow,https://punocracy.com/achieving-success-as-a-nigerian-musician-a-practical-guide-on-how-to-blow/,2020-09-12T09:41:00+01:00,"By: Jehu Etimbuk Sylas
Before
we begin, I will like to congratulate you for being a man; be thankful to
nature for this blessing. If you aren’t a man, either gear up for constant
sidelining or check your dreams for Plan B — unless you don’t mind wearing gold
chains, sunshades, do-rags and denim every day. You know, fake it till you make
it. Even then, you’d still have a slim chance, because Nigerians made a
groundbreaking discovery that having tiny bonus brains lodged within each
testicle improves creativity. More brains, more inspiration. Ignore big acts
like Simi and Tiwa; luck only finds a few. Once again, you are lucky to be a
man.
Now, do you plan to sing highlife, palm-wine music, jùjú, fuji and the like? Please ditch those immediately and get an afrobeats sample, or at least try dance hall. Hell, what were you thinking? That you’d be successful by singing highlife? You should note that diversity isn’t exactly valued in this industry. May we not be the enemies of our own progress. The only way to become a legend is by singing afrobeats or dance hall. Everyone knows Nigerians cherish those genres more than rice, so feed them. Ignore that those other genres may be dying. (You’ll eventually perfect the art of ignoring.) Leave the preservation of highlife to Oliver De Coque and Osadebe. They can still sing from their graves; they just don’t want to. As for jùjú and Fuji, the ever-young King Sunny Adé and Sir Shina Peters are still very much active. They may just be immortal. Who knows? But let’s look at your sample.
Make
sure it is a really danceable one because all anyone wants to do is dance. It
is the first thing we do when we wake up and the last thing before we sleep,
even after a long day. We want to fall asleep while dancing. We want to dance
while stuck in traffic, when at work and especially when trying to meditate. We
never want anything soothing — just dance.
If
you plan to be taken seriously by Nigerians – if you plan to blow – you have to
sing about women and their bodies. Especially their bodies. Strategy is
everything. Be sure to carefully objectify them with fail-safe phrases like
“whine your waist,” “shake yourbumbum” and “get down on me.” This is
also a good way to mask how intelligent you are. You need privacy. Somebad-bellesmight criticize you, say that your lyrics send a bad message. Ignore them.
Your music video is crucial. When your song fails to blow, it is your backup plan. For a good intro, get a curvy lady in a bikini to walk seductively away from the camera, her backside will be our confirmation that your video is promising. I mean, if there were women in the lyrics, it’s a no-brainer to have women in the video. Even if you disobeyed that rule and sang about something completely unrelated, there must be women in the video. It will be an implied apology to the public for not singing about women. Ignore that Nigerians are religious purists — they are very adaptable. The trademark at the center of the display that you couldn’t refuse from your producer will fade out and usher in the following scenes. In one of them, another lady (the more women the better) will walk past you and yourbros, and the camera should catch you guys shaking your heads, widening your eyes and biting your lips in want. Remember, they are objects for your pleasure. You must dance seductively with even more ladies to make this clear.
You will also need a lot of money, but just fake-note props. They will be stacked in bundles atop a large table alongside assorted spirits and liquor, and all your guys will be seated, each with a lady in hand, smoking and drinking. Tell the producer that you want to exhale the smoke in slow motion to show your skill, with the smoke coming out of your nose, mouth, ears and eyes. If it still doesn’t feel complete, you probably didn’t hire enough ladies or smoke well enough.
Be
sure to always dress responsibly. Wear your pants below your waistline at all
times, so that the fans can always see your glamorous underwear. Did I mention
neck chains? You’ll need them. Never be found in public without wearing at
least one. Also, please, get a tattoo or two, and be sure to reveal them in your
pictures.
Chase clout! You can attack other celebrities that are more famous, slander and insult them unashamedly on social media. The goal is to stir up controversy. You must blow at all costs, even at the detriment of other people’s reputations. By doing this, you might get loyalty from people who will judge the matter and pick sides. Nigerians are experts at judging matters. If you win, your small number of misguided fans will swear oaths in your name, and even some fans of the celebrity you are dueling with may jump ship. Most importantly, you will keep being discussed. You should also maintain an active social media presence — promote your noisy song by periodically announcing fake giveaways and upload flashy pictures that have you leaning on the bonnets of top-tier cars or lounging in expensively decorated mansions.
Ignore the fact that you can barely afford any of these. Just give the average Uche a glimpse of his dream. If you haven’t already, find a beautiful lady, get her pregnant and flaunt her on social media. Your baby mama is one of your trophies. You need to send the message that you are making serious money. This will make other youths like you abandon whatever they are busy with and start music careers, the same motivation you had.
During
election campaigns, promote “good” leadership by collecting huge amounts of
money to sing for corrupt candidates who are going for a second term after an
awful first term, or for even worse candidates trying to overthrow those
currently in power. Sing passionately and convince people to vote for these
men.  Public welfare doesn’t matter,
national development doesn’t matter, and the future doesn’t matter. Only your
pocket does. This is the only acceptable excuse for not making your lyrics
about women and their bodies. If you do this well enough to give them a return
on their investment, they just might secure you a political post in your local
government constituency. This will be your side hustle.
It
won’t take long before you finally blow. Some of your songs will be blasted at
wedding ceremonies and the couples will dance passionately, even competitively,
with enough aggression to make the floor taste the saltiness of their sweat, in
accordance with the Nigerian Wedding Ceremony Act. Some will even be remixed in
churches, despite how ungodly the lyrics may be, because the beat is just too
much of a “banger”. The angels will ignore any profanity and dance along. One
very important tip is that if you have managed to create a dance move with one
of your hits, the chances of making your way into churches will be greatly
incremented.
In
your shows and concerts, a great number of people will gather to watch you take
off your shirt and perform your songs. They’ll cheer loudly, screaming your
lyrics at the top of their lungs in sync with you. Some might even faint in the
process. Don’t be scared; this means you have really impacted people’s lives.
Some will cry because your songs have been so inspiring, and so enlightening, as
they have ceaselessly highlighted the social and political issues that continue
to ravage your country. Just be sure to throw mint 200 naira notes at the crowd
though, to prevent a stampede and help maintain peace.
And
lest we forget, when you finally become a celebrity and are interviewed,
remember to emotionally recount how you grew up in street gutters and barely
had clothes or shoes to wear to school, food to eat or a bed to sleep in. It is
compulsory, whether true or not, that you say it confidently. If by the time
you blow, there isn’t a large number of vulnerable Nigerians who worship and
admire you, desperately praying to become you someday, then you have to revisit
your strategy and figure out where you went wrong.
Blessings to your hustle,bro.

Nigerian parenting: A small handbook,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-parenting-a-small-handbook/,2020-09-12T09:31:37+01:00,"By: Jadesola Ajao
The first thing you need to know
is that you have to give birth to many children.Omo ni ade;they are your wealth, they carry on the family name,
they take care of you when you are old. If you decide to have one and that one
dies when he is twenty – remember that story of that boy that died during his
graduation? – what will happen then?
Your children are unpolished
clay; you have to mould them intoawonomoluabi. The ones that were moulded
well become lawyers, accountants, doctors or engineers. The ones that weren’t
becomeagberos.If you don’t train
your children well (and start early!) they will ignore the narrow path of
righteousness and go down the broad road to destruction.
Before your children are born,
decide what profession they will go into. Choose prestigious fields that
promise money and a good reputation – medicine, accounting, law, or
engineering. Do not entertain arrant nonsense like music or visual arts. Not
only will it disgrace your family name, your children will remain eternally
poor. You do not need to tell your children this profession; they will pick it
up from the conversations you have about them with your friends as they grow
older.
After your first child (preferably
a boy!) is born, buy akoboko,the
whip Fulani herdsmen use on their cattle. You will not need it now – except, of
course, you gave birth to a goat – but prices are increasing every day, so it
is best to buy early.
The first instrument you will use is your cane. Children are blank slates; it is important to whip the common sense into them. Whip him if he doesn’t prostrate properly when he greets you. Whip him if he forgets to greet you. Whip him if he is visits the neighbours too often; what is he going to look for in their house? Whip him if he accepts meals from the neighbours. Whip him if he shouts in the house. Whip him if he is too quiet. Whip him if he is rude to his mother. Whip him if his report card ever says anything other than “well-behaved child.” Every time you whip him for doing something wrong, he will understand what he did was wrong, and will never do it again.
Remember that your child is not
your friend; you do not need to sit down and have long conversations with him.
This kind of “friendship” leads to disrespect. If you need to relay a message,
either use your wife or your cane.  But,
if the message is so important you must speak yourself, be careful. Make sure
you don’t look directly into his face. Never say his name. Maintain an
irritated look throughout, no matter what the topic is. The correct posture for
your child while you are talking involves hunched shoulders, a sombre
expression, and head tilted downwards. Give him a slap if he crosses his arms
or his legs, interrupts you while you talk, or looks directly at you.
The only other kind of
conversations you need to have with your child are about his school results.
Make sure he is standing in front of you as you peruse them. If he gets scores
lower than average, lie him flat on his back and whip him till he bleeds. If he
gets average scores, tell him you are not slaving at your job to pay school
fees for a mediocre child. If he gets from the second to the tenth position,
ask him if the person with the first position has two heads. If he replies or
tries to justify this in any way, pull out yourkoboko.If he gets the first position, concentrate on the
individual scores. There must be a score that you can tell him to improve on.
Make sure you let him know that he can do better.
Your child must also be a useful
member of the house. He must get up early, sweep, wash plates, clean, assist in
cooking. If you ever see him seated in front of the television, ask if he has
done his chores. If he has failed in any respect, cane him. If not, think of
other duties to assign. If he has managed to complete every chore you can think
of, sit down and change the channel to a news channel. Ask him to go and read
his school books. Remind him you put yourself through school, that you didn’t
have a house as comfortable as the one he lives in, that the first time you
even saw a television was when you bought one after graduating from the
university.
Send your child to a boarding
secondary school. This will give him added strength of character. Opt for
federal government boarding schools, or even better, military boarding schools,
the Navy, Air-force, or Command schools. The advantage to this is that he will
receive training fit for soldiers. The disadvantage is your own whipping will
not be of any use anymore. This is when you will stop whipping and use your
words to inflict blows. If he fails, call him a disappointment, a waste of time
and money, a bad influence on his younger ones. Threaten to make him repeat a
class if he does not behave himself.
When your child is sixteen, he
will buy his JAMB form. Tell your wife to tell him that this will be the only
JAMB form you will buy for him. You will fill out this form yourself. Write
down your preferred course along with the second, third and fourth choices you
think might be good enough. Also pick the universities you think are the best
for him. He can fill out the rest himself.
If he gets below 200 in his first
JAMB, do not mince words about how disappointed you are. He is a failure and a
disgrace. Also tell him that you do not have the time or money to beg for
admission for him into a private university, whether or not youdohave the money. If his score is just
above 200, ignore him. If he gets a higher score, tell him to not congratulate
himself too whole-heartedly; everyone knows JAMB is useless anyway, the real
exams are yet to come.
When your child gains admission
into the university, it is important that you realise that he is reaching
another tangential point in his life; neither words nor whipping will prevent
him from not listening to you. This is when you will introduce your last
weapon; money. If he starts to fail his courses, fails to return home, or
starts to do something other than what you sent him to school to do; reduce his
allowance for some months. If it is a major transgression, threaten him with
not paying his school fees. This should also happen if you catch wind that he
is trying to make money or build a business while in school, like most young
children nowadays. Tell him, “Since you have money, you don’t need mine.” Do
not relent until it comes back to you, grovelling to be forgiven.
When he is finally about to
graduate, let him know that you will not attend his graduation ceremony if he
is not on a first class. If he somehow finishes with a first class, ask your
wife to ask him why he is not the best student in his department. If heisthe best student, ask her to ask him
if the best student in his faculty has two heads. If he is the best student,
ask for the best graduating student in his set.
When he finally graduates, you can wash your hands off him and congratulate yourself. It will be his job to send his younger siblings to school. You can now reap the fruits of your labour.

Candid suggestions for President Mumu-Man-Du,https://punocracy.com/candid-suggestions-for-president-mumu-man-du/,2020-09-12T09:27:58+01:00,"By: Iyilade Adeboye Samuel
Good day, President Mumu-Man-Du, the Commander-in-C(t)hief, my amiable f(r)iend. I hear you are greatly perturbed by the state of our nation; the hardship it is entrenched in, coupled with the fallacious claims from most citizens, that you are incompetent. Indeed, uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. To placate and encourage your perplexed self, I offer to you and your representathieves, my candid suggestions on how to positively manage the affairs of our nation. Some say you ostensibly practice something not so different, if true, please continue. If not, then accept this pacifying offering.
1.Use the rod:Mr. President, after thorough investigations, I’ve observed that the preponderant ratio of those that resent you are children and youths      (evident by how they vehemently clamored for a quick discard of the social media bill). It is in no way right that these ones defecate on the essence of our culture and talk back at elders (like yourself and your sinators), however wrong he/she might be.  I advise that you engage curtailing measures to inhibit their excesses, for example, to curb this moral decadence, do not pay parents their salaries, this move will ensure that parents learn to prioritize feeding, and not provide the children with ridiculous gadgets and data subscription plans. On the long run, these younglings will have no access to the social media they religiously employ, to make vilifying remarks about you. To achieve this aim among the youths (the lazy lots expecting to be spoon-fed), do not provide them with jobs.
Mr. President, children/youths are the future leaders of tomorrow, posterity will be bitter to us if we commit the affairs of the nation into their obstinate hands as they go astray, without redirecting them to the right path. Do not spare the rod, do not spoil the child.
2. Decimate the populace:Custodian of the villa(ins), weeks back you complained about how gravely seeded, this nation is in recession, such that only divine interventions can bring immediate changes. Sir, this need not be so, you can make do with the mustard seeds in your possession. To start with, I’ve identified the root cause of this problem; our population. Our country is a developing nation with insubstantial resources, I suggest you cut its coats according to its size, decimate the populace! In order to achieve this noble goal, permit the incessant slaughtering—of this country’s inhabitants—carried out by insurgents, bandits and herdsmen. The more the killings, the lesser the population. The lesser the population, the lesser the strain on the nation’s resources. Encourage also, by providing them with      ravishing meals and comfortable shelters, if they are diligent with these killings (combat them though, if they touch your relatives). Most family planning methods these days are trite, it is only right we embrace—and not antagonize—this efficacious cost-effective procedure. Our nation’s population is a malignant tumor that never stops growing, cauterize it!
I
also suggest (again) that you do not pay workers/parents—excluding your
relatives—their salaries, and keep the unemployed jobless. If salaries are not
paid , and the unemployed remain jobless, food can’t be purchased and put on
the table; members of families go hungry then become sick, and thanks to our
already dilapidated health care systems, the weak ones won’t receive treatment
and inevitably die, decimation is achieved! 
This pivotal suggestion is like that proficient stone that kills two
birds (emphasis on kills), implement it with utmost dexterity.
(P.S: incumbent governors promised—during elections—to repair roads with potholes responsible for accidents, they should please refrain; more accidents are needed to claim lives.)
3.Embrace your quietude:President Mumu-Man-Du, I must admit that I fervidly admire how you maintain tranquility, and stay mute during travailing times, please do not stop. Demons, masquerading as activists will demand that you assuage the pains and ululations of your people (especially if you implement the suggestions above), directing that you placate their pain by publicly addressing them. Please, do not concede to their sentiments, they are purblind individuals. I, for one, understand that your irrepressible muteness is not borne out of disrespect, but great salute for the dead, recognizing their noble sacrifice to leave you with lesser mouths to feed. Why give only a minute of silence, when you can forever be mute to respect their gallantry? Do not be disturbed by those demons, if no one recognizes your sacrosanct act for what it is, rest assured God does. Embrace your quietude sir!
4.Self-love: Great Commander-in-C(t)heif, in times of hardship, any explorable means of survival is fair. I admonish that you make efficient      use of your position to harness wealth for yourself and your relatives. I am not insinuating you should not have the interest of your nation at heart, no, (I already suggested measures on how to aid the nation,) but you must understand that charity begins at home, especially during perilous times. Ensure you save money (zillions of it), obtain exquisite cars and mansions, send your children to luxurious schools. Also ensure you give your children jobs; the jobs made unavailable to those that resent you (ensure the jobs are not strenuous though, your children should be treated like royalty, they came to this world holding silver spoons, respect them for that). People will say you have stolen, but rest assured you are doing the right thing.
5.Incapacitate resistance:Mr. President, unto every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction. Like you’ve already witnessed resistance, you will be met with more (plethoric for that matter) if you implement suggestions one to four, but be not dismayed, this fifth suggestion is designed to guide you on how to scrupulously mitigate these storms of resistance. It works like magic.
Starting
from the head, I advise that you inflict the byzantine trio—Democracy, Order
and Independence—with insanity. This trio will brazenly slander on the streets
to all that you—the supreme being presiding over the affairs of this country—be
subjected to banal laws meant for plebeians, and not be placed above it. Sir,
only people aspiring to be mad spit this kind of gibberish, I suggest that you
render them insane permanently, and when you do this, ensure that their state
of insanity is uninterrupted.
The
next sect you will have to tackle are the activists, those myopic demons. These
ones will incense the masses to revolt against you. I suggest that you make
scapegoats out of them by incarcerating them. If truly they want a great
nation, let them languish in prisons, praying to God to direct your noble
cause. After all, Joseph (the dreamer) spent years in one, before he attained
greatness, or have they stopped studying his story in their holy books? Take
this chaotic lots and send them to prisons–the deplorable kind–inaccessible to
anyone, except yourself. That way no one gets to hear their inciting gospels,
and they themselves will learn to stay quiet (just like you).
Mr.
President, some citizens will subtly resist, by trying to abscond to foreign
countries, claiming they are only hunting for green(er) pastures. For these
ones, please truncate their attempts, if indeed they desperately need to exit
the country, it should be to nowhere but heaven! Let them migrate to the camp
of insurgents (those hardworking men I told you to embrace) so they can have
themselves killed, let them leave the country as brave men (honoring the noble
cause of decimation) and not cowards (only cowards will chicken out in the face
of hardship). At least this way they will move to streets of gold instead of
grass.
The
youths will also oppose, to deaden these ones, please refer back to suggestion
1, the rod. In addition to the measures there, ensure to cut down the intended
budget allocated to the education of the ones still in schools. You should not
be wasting money on rebels.
Mr.
President, for the final part of this grand scheme, endow your black marshals
heavily with weapons and ammunitions, then deploy them to the streets.
Peradventure, the citizens decide to take to the streets in unison, demanding
you resign, these marshals will be available to shoot their aesthetic
bullets—at your command— into the voice box of these dissidents. I believe this
move will quieten them forever. Don’t be afraid to do this, even the creator—in
times past—covered the earth with a flood to wipe out myriads of rebels.
President
Mumu-Man-Du, tough times never last, only tough humans do, but for tough humans
to last, they must act. I implore you to implement these suggestions and adhere
to them, so tough humans can last. If you do this, our nation will be promoted
to the next satisfactory level, and the great change you envision will be
achieved. (* P.S: These suggestions are not restricted to your tenure alone.
Your successor can also use them. *)
With love,
your mirror image.

Made in Nanja,https://punocracy.com/made-in-nanja/,2020-09-11T10:16:24+01:00,"By: Isreal Winlade
Our democracy is twenty-one years old. This calls for a celebration; the type that requires Aso-Ebi and sumptuous jollof rice with chicken. It is a good thing to give thanks to God for keeping this unholy alliance together. Though many things have gone wrong in this our country, we are proud to flutter our flag though stained with the blood of innocent souls whose death always raises a dirge at nightfall in the North.
It is needless to talk about our economic feat, which has made us self-reliant by consuming locally made products like rice and fueling our noisy power generator with imported fuel. The standard of power supply in the country has also improved. The minister of power said many states now enjoy more than 20 hours of stable electricity every day. The names of these states have however been kept confidential out of the government’s modesty in not wanting to brag about their unfelt feat and probably to avoid raising tribal sentiments.
This year is very remarkable in our democracy. For the
first time, the country is acknowledging that a president was indeed elected on
the 12thof June 1992. Mr. President said he wants to ensure the
younger generation knows about the historical freest and fairest election,
which was annulled because of gross misconduct. Part of the history is how this
President we never had died in the grip of tyranny sponsored by General
Maigida. We must protect the image of Mr. President and skip where he was
frolicking with General Maigida while the show of tyranny was live on the street.
Mr. President is now a democrat. He even apologized with tears for being an
enemy of democracy as a young man. His reason is that his khaki and gun pushed
him to misbehave against the will of the majority.
To mark our new Democracy Day, Jàgbayìn lawmakers made
a show of strength yesterday by celebrating Sharo Festival in the House with
heavy punches. The Speaker was not lucky. When he got home, his wives had work
to do on his face. The three of them surrounded him and plastered the wounds on
his face with care. They didn’t ask him why his Chief Whip worked on his face
with so much blows. As good wives, they knew their place was inside his kitchen
and to be ready whenever duty called in the “other room.” His incredible effort
in this “other room” is made evident with the fruits of the womb. No wonder he
has twenty children and still counting.
We need to admit that the human resource is the greatest selling point of our nation. Our political leaders validate this. How many countries in the world have a group of politicians with outstanding talent to act as tricksters, part-time social media motivators and fulltime clowns without wearing a costume? Even the great U.S.A cannot boast of these talents. To add to these talents of theirs is the newly discovered skill in the ring. Instead of watching them fight themselves over who gets the lion share and the ant share of the House’s portion of the National cake, the Minister of Sports should try to convince the Chief Whip to represent Nanja at the next Olympics in the boxing category. With our set of lawmakers, it is glaring that Nanja is not just a country. It is a theatre of unending drama.
We must also commend the relentless effort of our
leaders in creating a democracy that fits our own political context. To make it
African, they carved an imaginary god they named inequality. Thanks to this
god, we can accept corruption as a privilege the politicians enjoy with their
acolytes and allies. They may even decide to explore the part of this privilege
that permits them to jail uncouth critics like Dantata who may be bad influence
on the people this democracy is created to exploit. To reward their friends for
being Nigerian with privilege, they award them contracts worth millions of
dollars that are mostly postponed to be executed when hens would have grown
teeth and honey would fall like rain from the sky.
Several things inspire Mr. President to act. One of
them is the urgency required to address a national matter. However, when it
comes to insecurity, he loses his voice and picks up the quietness of a
believer who awaits a divine manifestation because all power belongs to God.
Wailers didn’t like that. They quickly nicknamed him Ghost president. To prove
them wrong, he sacked his personal security agents who turned gun to toy. He
had clashed with one of the aides of Madam First Lady. If only this man knew
the Villa needed the peace that the people living in Damisa, in the province of
Igbesunmomi, can’t afford.
The people of Igbesunmomi have amazing stories to
tell; that of the atrocities committed by Apostolic Fighters for Seven Virgins
whenever they raided them to seize their girls and butcher their men. When they
seize these girls, they take them into their den located in the heart of
Kingisa forest and make them procreate to sustain their apostolic arm struggle
in honor of the god they serve. Many would think these apostles deserve to be
beheaded when caught. But they are very lucky.
They have a sympathizer in the person of Mr. President
to plead their cause. Once caught, they are transferred to a rehabilitation
center with an additional package of fully paid scholarship abroad to wash them
clean from every stigma of their past and fully induct them into the normal
society. Well, for the soldiers fighting against them, they know their fate is
in the hands of God. He is the only one that can reward them. They can fight
and capture these terrorists. They can even die at the front. One thing the
Government won’t fail to do is to give them a befitting burial with full military
honor.
Last week, these sects of Apostolic Fighters for Seven
Virgins explored technology and released a video showing how they beheaded a
student and a cleric. Out of concern, all Nigerians gathered like the Americans
gathered on the street to protest against the death of Floyd. In this case, the
gathering was only on Twitter while the hashtag was
#Nanjanas&Soldiers_lives_matter. I was happy we were showing courage from
the comfort of our room. We looked serious. Even more serious than founding
fathers who declared a #Revolution_Now during colonization against the Queen’s
authority.
After one week of this trend online, our Dancing
Senator released a video of him dancing to the song of Mafia Bob with his slay
queen. That gist spread like harmattan fire and burnt every attention earlier
given to the killings going on in the country. Mafians, the disciples of Mafia
Bob were delighted to watch the incredible talent of Dancing Senator dancing to
the music that inspires yahoo boys in their indiscriminate pursue of wealth.
In all these, my concern is that this new virus, which
started among the rich should not tamper with the life of our politicians. I
can’t imagine them cope with the quality of the healthcare they abandoned while
patronizing first class medical treatment in Arabia. Since this virus called
Covik-1,9 has been making the rich lose their peace and causing the government
to declare national weeks of rest not mindful of the rate of hunger it would
trigger, the poor boy that lives under the bridge had to raise an altar of
prayer against the spread of the virus. The government instructed everybody to
remain in their house. Again, the boys with no house to sleep understood how
much the government cared for them. They endured being lonely until the
lockdown was lifted and the street became noisy again. Covik-1,9 has made us
tremble. It made Mr. President and his acolytes panic too. It caught his
attention as if hunger and malaria had not been killing poor people in their
millions too.
As we mark this democracy day, let us remember the
victims of our made in Nanja democracy who await the wrath of God to consume
our privileged leaders. These leaders know God’s wrath can’t be their portion.
They are not only faithful tithers and consistent contributors of huge sum of
money towards the building of more places of worship. They also dine with the
mouthpieces of the Lord on earth. The only wrath that can have effect on them
is that of the people. Would the people come to understand that the made in
Nanja democracy exists for the salvation of the rich and the damnation of the
poor? Well, time would tell. Pending this time, I wish everybody a happy
democracy day.

"The police force: One hassle, different officers",https://punocracy.com/the-police-force-one-hassle-different-officers/,2020-09-11T09:59:56+01:00,"By: Halimah Adisa
ACT ONE, SCENE ONE
The day is bright as the sun whispers, “Good morning.” It is on the 2nd of June. The year is 2020 and life breathes differently. Inside the police station in Miami, on the ground floor, we see officers having coffee to start the day which is filled with a lot of activity. Each officer is assigned to a cubicle that has the latest computer.  There are enough surveillance cameras in getting criminals. The technology is top notch. There is a CCTV camera to know who comes in and out of the station. The notion to protect the lives and properties of their citizens isn’t found nowhere in the world and it shows it means a lot to them.
On the second floor, there are three officers. They are seen talking about the recent rape case that was brought before them. One is Martin, the captain, and the other officers are Marcus and Jim. They are both seated before Martin. The line for the conservation is soon drawn.
CAPTAIN Martin:[drops his coffee]How about the forensic? Have you visited the lab today, Marcus.
Marcus:Oh yeah!
Jim and I went there today. It should be ready before midnight.
CAPTAIN Martin:Okay! That’s great. We should work as a team in getting the culprit. Let’s bring justice to the victim.
Jim:What
is the President saying on the case? It has gone viral.
CAPTAIN Martin:He
had advised every force to be on a lookout, Jim.  He also made it clear that we pledge to
protect the lives and properties of the people.
Jim:We
are the people too. We should protect and guide.
MartinandMarcus:Yes, exactly, Jim. [Marcus phone rings]
Incoming call:Hello,
officer. This is Angela from the Miami hospital. The forensic is ready.
Marcus:Oh! Thank you, Angela. [Drops the call] That’s from the hospital.  The forensic is ready.
Martin and Jim:That’s
good. Let’s go get it.
They took their badges
and left for the hospital.
ACT TWO, SCENE ONE
Here, the sun gives a look that neglects the abuses of the people living under it. It is in the morning on the 2nd day of June. The year is 2020. The sun is blazing like fire, and as hell is being explained, like how the coal melts the skin, it shows no difference between here and hell. Inside the police station which is painted with the strip of blue, yellow, and green are some officers having Alomo to start their day which is of course filled with a lot of activity. The station is crowded. There are lots of complaints filed and the officers at the counter are taking orders. Beside the counter are some wooden chairs. They must have been there since independence.
The inner room is the I.P.O’s
office. With him are two other officers. They are seen talking about the recent
rape case. They seem to care so much about the topic. The I.P.O’s name is Rauf
while the other officers go by Ali and Bayo. They stand before the I.P.O. They
are seen with their Alomo bottles and the line for conversation is soon drawn.
I.P.O. Rauf:[drops his gin] How do we go about this lady’s case?
Ali:Oga,
I have no idea o. I no know wetin dey do our women sef.
I.P.O. Rauf:Weytin
you mean?
Ali:She says she was raped. Shey she fit deny sey she no enjoy am? [Shaking his head abnormally.]
Bayo:[laughing] That’s true ooo. Abi na she be the first woman wey them go rape?
I.P.O. Rauf:You both are not serious, Walahi. [Laughing hysterically] We sey make she come sign mobility form she no won sign. Mobility form that is not too expensive…
Bayo:But
Oga weytin our president talk because the matter don go far ooo.
I.P.O. Rauf:Na
agbe our president be. Na that small boy, Tolu dey help am write speech. The
one wey I read for Twitter I no even understand am at all. Na everyday people
dey tag us for tweet on Twitter. Make we just pretend we dey do our work. Gaskiya!
Ali and Bayo:We
dey your back, Oga.
Ali:Weytin we go
do now if she come sign that mobility form?
I.P.O. Rauf:Don’t
you know your job again? If she signs the form, then we would do our job. And
what is our job?  To arrest anybody
closer to her and force them to confess. No be weytin we dey do be that? E no
hard, my boys.
Ali:Bloody civilians. Make we dey work for them? We no fit stress over any matter. [Laughs then drinks from his Alomo.]
A knock is heard at the door. It is one of the officers from the counter. He has come to serve them orders from the counter. He brings a message that the victim has come to sign the mobility form. And that paves way for the truthfully-false investigations.

The many reasons why I am pro-abortion,https://punocracy.com/the-many-reasons-why-i-am-pro-abortion/,2020-09-11T09:16:08+01:00,"By: Gracious Egedegbe
I own a penis. It is important to start with that.
Why? My penis clouds my judgment. I don’t have the right to tell a woman what
to do with her body, unless, I am pro-abortion. If I am pro-abortion, then it
doesn’t matter if I own a penis or not. Bonus points if I am in a
science-related field. My views will be all over the place. It is sheer
arrogance for a penis owner to go against abortion. After all, penis owners
don’t listen to vagina owners on health-related issues.
That said; allow me to promote my arguments for
abortion.
1. Abortion is a victimless crime.When a woman commits abortion, she hurts no one! You see that thing that she seeks to remove is just that – a thing! It is not alive. Some penis owners and backstabbing vagina owners have argued that that ‘thing’ is biologically alive. It’s alive? So what! It’s just a bundle of cells. Those cells can’t survive on their own so they don’t matter. In fact, anything that cannot survive on its own doesn’t matter. Except for my sick father who is in a coma or my vegetate grandmother or more importantly, my newly born child that cannot survive on her own.
2. It’s a woman’s body!A woman has the right to do whatever she likes with her own body. Does she want to cut her hands off? Fine! Does she want to kill herself? Fine! Does she want to get rid of a bundle of cells inside of her? Fine! Why? Because it’s her body! Wait? The bundle of cells isn’t her body? What do you mean? That the bundle of cells has a unique DNA and is biologically alive doesn’t make my argument invalid. That is why an abortion can be carried out at any time. If a woman wants to carry out an abortion seconds before labour, she should be allowed to. It’s her body!
3. Abortion is not killing a person.I think I overreacted in the previous point. I only support abortion when that thing is just a bundle of cells. The moment it becomes a person, I think it becomes murder. Happy now? How do I know when the bundle of cells becomes a ‘person’? That’s a stupid question, you know. Do you know what they call a Zygote? The thing that happens when the sperm forcefully penetrates an egg? That is not a person. It’s a… Do you think I will say ‘thing’ again? Aha! I won’t fall into your trap. Some stupid people will argue that under the law, an entity is either a property or a person. Even if it’s valid, the zygote is a property. Somewhere along the line, the property becomes a person. I’m tired of this point already.
4. A lot has been invested in it.Let me pray for you: your investments will never go to waste. Did you say amen? Good. Now, consider this: the act of abortion is being perfected through innovative pills and surgical techniques.  Killing unborn babies of people you’ve never met requires a lot of resources, personnel and dedication. Western countries and international organizations donate billions of dollars each year to African countries so abortions can stay legal and accessible. If you argue against abortion, you are an ingrate! How can people donate so much so you can kill your unborn children with ease and you don’t want? How? How much have they invested to help mothers and fathers? Don’t ask me such. Those fools should have aborted their children when they had the chance.
5. Legalized abortions save lives.When abortion is legalized, we save the lives of women and young girls who would have died at the hands of quack abortionists. These women and young girls were in danger from their unborn children. If they don’t abort those children, they will die. If they go to quacks, they will die. Think about that. We are saving lives by killing unborn babies. Do the lives of unborn babies matter more than living persons who don’t want those babies? Oh shut up! Don’t tell me that fear of ridicule, intimidation; poverty and sheer irresponsibility are causes of abortion. I don’t want to hear the underlying issues or how to solve them. All I want is to kill those unwanted twats.
6. Young people need abortion.One reason why a penis owner should support abortion is that it saves him from responsibilities. Imagine that a young broke writer like me gets a young broke lady pregnant. How do you want us to explain to our parents and sponsors and pastors that we have tasted the forbidden fruit? Let us get this abortion instead. It’s the easiest way out. Instead of accepting responsibility, please let me chicken out. I am not a man, I am a chicken. A chicken with a penis. Those who have accepted responsibility, learnt from their mistakes and are working to make things better are either fools or have two human heads. Remember, I am a chicken. I only have a chicken head.
7. Poor people should be able to abort their pregnancies.There are two ways to reduce the number of childbirth at home: family planning and abortion. For poor people, the only viable option is abortion. A dead child is better than a poor child. Can’t the baby see that the family is poor? Can’t the baby see that they have three children already? That baby is just being stubborn and stupid and that is punishable by murder. Should we work on reducing unemployment? No! Should we make family planning available and affordable? No! Should we ask our pastors and Imams to teach family planning in their religious centers? No! Should we go to schools to teach youths and teenagers different forms of family planning? No. What we need is to make abortion more accessible.
8. Rape victims should be able to kill unwanted children.Some rape victims suffer great distress and it is unfair to make them let any memento from their experience to live. I know we penis owners can never understand this point because we can’t experience it. That is why we need to shut up when this point is raised. Don’t talk about therapy. Don’t talk about support from family, friends and community. Don’t talk about women who raised children born out of rape and are happy they did. Just shut up when this point is raised. The foolish ones that want to keep the pregnancies against their parents’/sponsors’ advice should be abandoned. The ones who are delivered of rape babies should be gossiped about and stigmatized so future rape victims can learn.
9. Unwanted babies prevent women from living empowered lives.The moment a baby enters a woman’s body, it begins to destroy things. Her career is over. Her education is over. Her entire life is over. And whose fault is it? It is not the culture of stigmatizing single mothers. It is not greedy firms who do not give women maternity leave. It is not a generation of irresponsible men and boys who do not want to accept responsibility for their actions. It is the baby’s fault. The baby uses a straw to drink the mother’s empowerment from within. The baby must die. A woman cannot be empowered to raise a child. No! The countless women who were able to raise children and live meaningful lives should be ashamed of themselves.
10. Children born of incest should die!Do you know incest is a sin against God and nature? God said we should have nothing to do with the fruits of unrighteousness. Incestuous children are fruits of unrighteousness, they must die. Children born out of wedlock are also fruits of unrighteousness but God understands. Nature tells us that incestuous children are more likely to be born with all kinds of illnesses. That is why they should die too. For children born with disabilities that are conceived out of normal unions, well, they are worthy of love. Don’t forget to stigmatize young children who were forced into incestuous relationships, and their offspring too, should they be stupid enough to keep them. Besides, I hope you know that in most cases, the girl is the stupid one. The father doesn’t want his act of love to become life while the mother worries what people will say about her in the market. So the girl has to abort the baby. It’s the only option for a wise and humane fellow.
The next time you see a pregnant woman, look at her with pity. She probably cannot afford an abortion or her penis owners in her life won’t let her.

On mourning a son,https://punocracy.com/on-mourning-a-son/,2020-09-10T08:47:22+01:00,"By: Gabriel Ikisang*[i]
There are different reasons for which people may want to mourn a son. This guide is useful for those keeping their eyes on the big goals of their son’s property or their son’s wife. For eye-service tips on how to pretend you weren’t actually the one who killed your son, check out our guide on mourning louder than the bereavedhere.
Mourning
Requirements
A mournable dead son, his wife, their property.
Also:
For individuals using the “she” pronoun—meaning
women related to the chief mourners—tears are a good way to start the day, for
without it how shall the neighbors know you are pained at your loss? But note
that more than a day’s tears can cause bodily and emotional weakness that may
disrupt your mourning process.
Strength too is important, to uphold your culture
and fight lawyers. Regular muscle conditioning as well as voice volume lessons
are recommended.
Last but not least, an inhumane heart.
The
Mournable Son[ii]
In addition to the standard definition of son, your son must have beenwell-standingin life to deserve of mourning. A medical doctor, a school principal or a successful business man is a mournable son. This is so because the above and their caliber possess the ability of fulfilling one important requirement: Belonging to more than one man and one woman; otherwise known as Family Acceptability.[iii]For a son to be worthy of mourning, the whole family must own him: uncles must talk often about how they blew phlegm out of his nose in his infancy even if these uncles had had a fight with the son’s father in those days and never visited. Aunts—especially those who had then gone searching for greener pastures in Lagos—must talk about how they bathed the son and fed him. But above all, brothers, especially those that envied the son because he didn’t live in a rented house like them, must boast of how they lent the son half the money he used to build his three properties.
In the light of this, all should see that this
guide—unlike some others in this volume— isn’t a motherhood guide. In fact,
experts have confirmed that mothers are in the large part incompetent in
mourning their sons. The case worsens when such mothers’ husbands are dead.
Thus, the pronoun “you” in this guide is largely plural, collectively referring
to the consanguineous conglomeration of brothers, uncles, in-laws and their
supportive female counterparts—sisters, wives, aunts—who have kindly gathered
to mourn their son.
How to Mourn a Son
Begin with being foolishly sure that the deed has
been done, that his wife has killed him. You can complement this with a huge
sigh of relief. Be ready to cry soon, so don’t express your happiness that
you’ll finally share your son’s property among yourselves.
Call other relatives and tell them your son’s wife
has killed your son. If you use the “she” pronoun, cry at this point. As much
as possible, call your son by his name and his wife by the noun “wife” or the
pronoun “she”:Mike’s wife has killed himorShe has killed himare good examples. That way Mike will be the human being you all care about and
“she” will be the undeserving animal that came to dismantle the family. She has
killed him, you should say. It should not matter if Mike died of AIDS or kidney
failure, it should not matter if “she” had been the one caring for him with her
money and time. What should matter is his property, and for that, your son’s
wife must be accused of murder.
Next, have a family meeting to decide what to do
about your son. Discuss how he should be buried, how his wife should be
interrogated and accused, and who will take care of the “whole process.” Family
members in the village would know a great deal about how to go about the “whole
process” as it involves old harmful traditions.
Some of your son’s brothers or uncles should go to
your son’s wife and accuse her of killing your son. She should be told that,
according to the ways of your fathers, she’ll have to take part in some rituals
to prove her innocence. Depending on her literacy and economic stand, two
outcomes are possible.
1stOutcome: Compliance
In this case, do wicked things to her. The goal is
to make sure she hate and fear you, becoming mentally tired of seeing you in
her live. Thus, she’ll leave all of her husband’s and her property to you.
These are examples of evil things you can do to her:[iv]
All the above should be done without fear of arrest
or the law. It should help your nerves to know that the “Harmful Widowhood
Practices” provision in the VAPP Act[vi]is only words on paper; it is never ever enforced. This does not only apply in
the more than 50% of 36 states that still haven’t adopted the VAPP, but all
over the country.
N.B: In order to clear your consciences and look good in the eyes of men, these things must not be portrayed as discrimination but as the way of your fathers. It should not matter if you are an elder in your church.
2ndOutcome: Defiance
This is likely if your son’s wife is educated and
knows her rights. In this case, she would say bad things about your culture.
Take offense at this. Pretend that your culture does not have bad things in it.
Pretend that you did not hate your culture when you had to loan from a bank to
pay your wife’s bride price, when your father was mourned by his brothers and
you were starving because your mother lost all she had to greedy in-laws.
Be angry and tell your son’s wife—all of you in
many voices—that since she does not want to partake in the rituals, she had
killed your son. Say you must rescue your son’s property from his murderer.
Pretend not to know that she worked for that property as well.
It is likely she’ll not agree. She’ll say something
about the law and shall threaten with a lawyer.[vii]In cases where your son left a will allocating their property to her, it might
seem really difficult. Nonetheless, don’t relent. She’d just lost a partner,
that’s enough to suffer, enough to sabotage her fight. Besides, the law will
only back her up if you retreat. So, never forget that the Nigerian legal
system is filled with holes from which the powerful can always escape. In this
case you are the powerful, not only because you outnumber her but also given
the fact that she is likely to be chased away from her job for being a widow
and that no bank will give her a loan because she does not have a husband.
Finally, the case will be thrown out of court in a
matter of weeks, and you’ll achieve your goal of stealing property that doesn’t
belong to you.[viii]And as you all wished for, “she” will suffer; her children will starve. Forget
totally that in mourning a son, you’re killing a daughter, that you have
daughters whose husbands shall be mourned. This is not important.
We hope that this guide will be able to help you
properly mourn your son.
Endnotes
[i]A
son (“he”) is primarily a human born with a penis between his legs. From
childhood, sons show signs of violence, play football, should be clothed in
dull colors. To raise perfect sons, parents should buy their sons toys like
guns and footballs, prevent them from kitchen work and flog then if they wear
their mothers’ heels. Else, a serious mutation can occur whereby the being,
though possessing of a manhood, looses his sonliness.
[ii]Do
note that louts and other economically unstable “he” individual such as those
living in rented apartments, though may qualified as son are not mournable,
thus are not regarded as sons in this context.
[iii]Certain
schools of thoughts antagonistic to our honored and age-old tradition of
mourning may term this “claiming”, where the in-laws involved are portrayed in
the awfully bad light of greed after the successful son’ material possessions.
These SoTs tend to take our definition of son more serious than we the advocate
when against us in arguments about mourning. We should make clear that only
sons who are men are mournable, and as it is clear with the high number of male
children unworthy of envy today, to be a man is still not a day’s job.
[iv]For
a comprehensive training on how to wickedly torture other human beings, check
our guide: How to Physically Oppress Widows, LGBTX, House Boys/Girls,
Apprentices, Madmen, and Suspected Market Pilferers for Desired Results.
[v]Kill
her out of love to be with him.
[vi]Violence
Against Persons (Prohibition) Act. An anti-mourning federal law that
fortunately is not being adopted by many states and not being enforced where
adapted. Some anti-mourning groups showing radical tendencies and
dissatisfaction still criticize the “backwards” mentality of our government for
having made the law just in 2015 only after the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition
Act, which is in more utility and which they say is barbaric. Mourners must
guide against this forward-moving tendencies.
[vii]The
law allocates spouses their death partners’ property. That’s why it is strongly
recommended to make your sons marry under religious or customary law because
these deny women of inheritance rights for your own good.

The horrors of homosexuality,https://punocracy.com/the-horrors-of-homosexuality/,2020-09-09T08:22:55+01:00,"By: Faith Ofure EHIS
While the world is being torn apart by viral pandemics, cases of rape, murder and the likes, let us put that aside and focus on a more serious issue, the hideous crime of homosexuality. Could there be anything more disgusting than two humans of the same sex finding love and companionship with each other? Probably not. There is nothing normal about individuals engaging in intimate relationships that won’t result in making babies – totally unproductive and time wasting.
The perpetrators of this act are
criminals and are undeserving of a peaceful life, happiness and even the right
to be called humans. It is therefore totally fine for us as pious and perfect
members of the society to condemn, ostracize, bully, belittle or even be
violent with these creatures as we help God judge and punish them, who knows,
biblical sins like lying, stealing, fornication (heterosexual) and other petty
things the society accepts as normal would also then considered normal in the
eyes of God.
For biological, psychological or no reason at all, these individuals choose to deviate from the norm- like being different has ever being a good thing — and engage in barbaric activities that cause harm to the minds of all who hears about it.
While creating scarcity for spinsters and bachelors in need of heterosexual partners to continue their respective lineages, the act of homosexuality even more than excessive drinking, drug addictions, teenage pregnancies and terrorism threatens the mental, spiritual and physical well-being of the younger and soon-to-come generations. Imagine a world full of people who feel free to express themselves as they truly are — the horror!
As judges in our own rights, we shouldn’t allow a group of people unnecessarily contribute to checking our overpopulation issues.
We should probably go back to the old days where gays were either killed or taken to mental homes and churches to be cured, the days when twin babies were cursed, females were property and solely for reproduction — mutilated and sold out before puberty — and the blacks were inferior to the whites. Social differences weren’t so ridiculous then and things generally made more sense at least the term “feminism” didn’t exist.

It was the same man with a divergent body who sits. I could see his hair fairer than a dove. Villagers share a tradition from his ruin/reign of eternity.

How to raise your children,https://punocracy.com/how-to-raise-your-children/,2020-09-08T09:34:33+01:00,"By: Eluwa Emmanuel
Here are some tips in the Nigerian parenting manual 101, in it lies the secret to a responsible man or woman in the future. Be strict in adhering to these laid out secrets that are tested and trusted.
Motherly Responsibility
You must first give birth obviously, you must do this to please the neighbors, your parents need to carry their grandchildren, your church members, deacons who look upon you with indignation, your friend who have jokingly mocked you for been childless, your coworkers in the office and your village people, your relatives need to perform their tradition depending on the tribe you are from.
Though you didn’t want this child now, later you will see that this child is a blessing from the lord, why would you see this child as a burden? The pressure was just nothing, that’s the Nigerian way, then imagine the joy if it is a male child, their joy would be endless. You have pleased a lot of people and this is how it should be. Smile for finally you have rubbed mud on your haters face.
This is your child, you must treat it with all the love and care you can muster, bathe, breastfeed, change diapers; it is the duty of the mother to do everything; do not look to your husband for support; he is there to scold you for not preparing dinner for him when he is back from wherever he has come from. This love you show for your child and husband is great and shows how committed you both are in loving your child. Probably you would appreciate it if he at times carries the child but it always ends up in arguments of how tired he is. Take this as his way of showing his love for you and the child; well he provides the money to buy baby’s food and food for the house.
He, on weekends might shower you with love, gifts and call you sweet names all these are ways he has shown he truly cares and then he finally carries the baby, tosses it around and when its bowls are filled, he calls on his loving wife to take care of everything. The woman must cater for the child’s health, take it to the hospital.
The child grows and with growth comes responsibility. When the child causes mess in the house, shout at him or her; call it names like ewu, nnama, idiot… beat him or her at times. All these project how much you care for this child. You must be strict with this child, allow him only little freedom; you don’t want a rebellious man or woman in the future. All these are your home-training program, take it seriously. Ensure to lay down people who this child should associate with and don’t let them associate with certain people because of their tribe, skin colour or others you deem unfit depending whether you’ll like to raise an ethnocentric fellow or not.
Fatherly Responsibility
Under this is a lot, you must equip yourself for the task ahead; it is not easy at all but don’t worry you will scale through. Here are some tips you must adhere to to make parenting easy and train your child in the way they should grow.
You must be a father at all times, show no emotions at all as this is for the weak. Don’t play with your child, what will people say about you? Care about your masculine reputation – go out with friends more often and share jokes of how great your son will turn out to be in the future. Wake up early and leave and return very late when the child is sleeping; of course there is nothing you can do. Do not wear yourself out with taking your children to school, cooking or preparing breakfast when your wife is tired. Thank goodness, your wife is an ever-working-robot. Take pride that you are doing your best.
You must provide money for your nagging wife, not much but enough as you deem fit so she could stop shouting at all times. You know you are trying your best. Pretend to not know school fees are being paid, children need to go to outing at times, and be deaf to the children’s needs.
Show no mercy to this child should it deviate from rules you have set down as the head of the family. Let them not forget the rod of correction and by the words of your mouth discipline is established. Note that you mustn’t apologize even if you know you are at fault.
Don’t worry about your
relationship with this child, they must understand the sacrifices you make.
Even when you fight with your non-understanding wife, ensure you show your child who is the head and beat your wife in front of them, shout at her and leave the house if needed or send her out for the night… as these will build a strong relationship with your child in the future.
Just as the eye can see, I’m crooked but it doesn’t matter, as far I can still draw straight lines. Ambivert, but in writing very outspokenly extrovert."

shortlisted will be officially disqualified on the grounds of campaign of
calumny, dastardly acts and irregularities of credentials.
Meanwhile, in a bid to be proactive against the general election, different committees should be setup to liaise prolific strategies for this great party to emerge victorious. Of interest to the forthcoming general election are; INEC liaison committee, EFCC indictment committee, Pentecostal/Orthodox industry committee, judiciary lobbing committee, and the Twitter/Facebook committee. Please all hands should be on deck and operations should commence in earnest.

Your Excellency Mr. Chairman, we appreciate your wisdom in this crucial period. All necessary operations will kick-start. The Cabal; Godfathers, Chieftains, and Stakeholders have setup the necessary committees as rightly suggested in your previous memo. Gratitude to God almighty, the representatives of the different committees and the party flag bearers are in smooth negotiations with their respective departments. The INEC liaison committee will include the INEC chairman in her payroll till after the election. More so, since experience has shown indicting the credibility of opposing parties’ flag bearers is a step to electoral success, the EFCC officials will be brought to agreement on how to shortlist names of threatening oppositions for public corruption. In the same vein, the committee for Facebook and Twitter has come up with names of five erudite professors of high calibers with powerful social media influence. They will be saddle with the responsibility of succinctly and logically rationalizing on social media platforms the credibility of this party and her flag-bearer before, during, and after the election.
Also, having understood the psychology of average Nigerian that votes, the party flag-bearers have been commissioned to begin their pre-election items distribution, such as; small bags of rice, salts, beans, flour, exercise books, sugar, T-shirts branded with the party logo, flag bearer’s name and photo. Mr. Chairman, rest assured the Cabal; Godfathers, Chieftains and Stakeholders are ready to provide further assistance towards the success of the forthcoming general election. To this end, the party’s ‘Mr. Fix It’ will be delegated to write top religious leaders in the Pentecostal/Orthodox industry for prophetic endorsement.

Fraternal greetings to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hope this letter finds you well; if so, doxology. I am directed to write you this memo on behalf of the cabal; Godfathers, chieftains, and stakeholders of our prestigious party to crave your spiritual and prophetic awareness towards the forthcoming general election. As the holy bible says in Psalm 127:1: “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builder’s labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over a city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.” It is with this we are confident with you nothing is impossible in the political realm. Your relevance and contribution to the dividend of democracy in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized.
We are at the phase of reaching out to religious leaders for necessary strategies towards having a landslide victory in the coming general elections. Testifying to your good reputation in political prophecies, the party has dimmed it fit to seek God and His servant first so that every other thing will be added unto her. It is against this background the party wishes to saddle you with the responsibility of spiritually and prophetically endorsing her flag-bearers in the forthcoming general election, thereby announcing and anointing them as ‘God-sent’ leaders.
Also, in a bid to achieve our aims without traces of conspiracy with you, the party strategists are proposing you carry out your own responsibility during your periodic pre-election prophecy sessions. This will go a long way to serve as the major campaign for the party and her flag-bearers, calm the nerves of Nigerians when irregularities occur during and after the election. More so, you should disenfranchise the members of your congregation to either vote for our party or stay back at home projecting in them how fetish and demonic every other party is except our great party.
Be that as it may, the Cabal; Godfathers, Chieftains, and Stakeholders in consonance with the party chairman have decided to put up some innovation in your ministry. Firstly, directives had been given to all party flag-bearers to begin the sowing of seeds pending their post-election thanksgiving services that will be graced stupendously by party delegates. This is also an avenue to start preparing toward this great occasion, to ensure necessary arrangement for men of such caliber. Of interest to you are plans to also build a gigantic prayer auditorium to boost your ministry and for convenience of party members (that will be second to none in Nigeria).
It is also a thing of concern for the party to get you a new private jet. You will need it for easy mobility to and fro doing the work of God. There is absolutely no reason why a man of God of your caliber should suffer discomfort while carrying out the work of God. You should not mind those wicked critics who wish to loud-mouth, the private jet is a token of your struggle to give Nigeria nascent democracy. This is just a little about how our memorandum of chop-make-we-chop will go.

Beer parlour talk,https://punocracy.com/beer-parlour-talk/,2020-09-07T07:12:56+01:00,"By: Damilola Ayomide
I had joined my neighbour at the drinking parlour
the night before. He looked devastated, like one who was about to be drowned in
perpetual sorrow. He was rarely like that, so I knew it had to be something
serious. I quizzed him till he finally said something. Something that affected
him, me, and every man in our community. He initially laughed at my colossal
ignorance. ‘You no dey Facebook?’
I knew about Facebook. The girl I “ate” last spoke
to me about it. She asked me to join so we could be chatting frequently. The
way she spoke about it, like it was a place of perfection, paradise. That’s not
exactly far from the truth anyway. Her pictures were stunning, so much that I
had to “like” every single one of them, and I saw that she had many other
admirers, particularly men. I shook my head. What a libertarian: women were
beginning to disregard their place. I could never think of proposing marriage
to her. Anyway, I knew my own housewife wouldn’t dare keep such women as
friends: she would have to lose a tooth first. The lump in my throat thickened
when I saw her exchange with a man: ‘thanx luv’ was her reply. I wasn’t the
only one she was replying with ‘luv’, apparently. I couldn’t but laugh at my
naivety. With that backside? I definitely couldn’t have been her only man.
My neighbour continued to talk about this Facebook
that I only used to search for more girls. After Cynthia, I’ve met Oge, Bimbo
and Matilda. Oge was always asking for money, I had to block her. She wasn’t as
big as Cynthia on the backside, but she had a massive front that made my palms
simultaneously sweaty and itchy each time I saw her. I almost grabbed them out
of her blouse at the hotel reception during our final meeting. It wasn’t my
fault; I was too hard because of the cold weather and she was wicked enough to
wear a transparent chiffon. I miss her though. But she too, like Cynthia,
cannot stay with me as a wife. She liked money too much and her tongue rolled
very fast like a tyre; I almost slapped her once.
‘These people want to kill all of us. They hate us.
They hate us.’
My neighbour was talking about the news that was
all over social media, the one that had his heart heavy and stole his usual
playfulness. It was the death of a man in the States. A man murdered because
his skin colour was different, because he was black. My neighbour was hardly
himself anymore. This was a man who would owe his creditors for months yet
laugh whenever they publicly harassed him and thereafter walk straight into the
drinking parlour to order more bottles of beer on credit. ‘To ease my sorrow’,
he often said. ‘This life na jeje’. I didn’t know something could rile him this
much.
He was not done lamenting and cursing. He wanted a
retaliation, a full-blown battle. I began to talk. ‘You think say we fit win this
one sha?’ ‘These people dey very powerful.’ Of course, he wasn’t having my
scepticism, my very sensible and diplomatic approach – I didn’t get that
diploma in Human Relations for nothing. Was I mad? Certainly. I was angrier
than he was. How dare they? We are men. Men, just like they are. That should
count. We are not animals. We deserve humane treatment. It is high time this
unequal treatment stopped. What did we ever do wrong anyway? Men are not slaves
nor animals.
My phone rang. It was my housewife. Money again. When would a man ever rest? Not even in my own country, my own home. ‘Na you say make I nor work na.’ I certainly couldn’t let her work. Who would raise my children? Women had to be tamed. Give them an inch, well, you know the rest. I wouldn’t know how I would react if she ever had an affair. I could kill. And if he was richer or more powerful, she would have to pay heavily for disregarding me, disobeying my authority and my rulership. She couldn’t be like Oge nor Cynthia: she dared not. Not my Mama Ejiro.
‘Ejiro don dey chop too much o. You sure say no be
worm?’
‘If na worm, na money you go give for mericine.’
‘I go soon reach house.’
I ended the call before my son could speak. My
neighbour was already on his fourth bottle. Poor man. If he got back home that
night in one piece, it would have been a miracle. He was deeply disturbed by
the murder, I could tell. I wished I could say the right words to him, but I
was also incensed and could only prevent myself from throwing a bottle against
the wall. A pop-up flashed through my phone’s screen: “#BlackLivesMatter”.
‘Indeed’, I muttered. Before I could slip it back into my pocket, something
else appeared. ‘#JusticeforUwa’, I read audibly.
I heard a hiss. ‘That girl?’ ‘Why did she also go
to read in a church?’ ‘Is the church a library?’ ‘They’re not telling us the
truth’, my neighbour uttered successively.
‘No mind dem,’ I re-joined. ‘These small girls of nowadays, only God knows what she really went there to do.’
‘They must pay for touching our man,’ he said after a brief period of silence.
I stared into the darkness. ‘Yes, bro, they must pay.’

To whom it may concern,https://punocracy.com/to-whom-it-may-concern/,2020-09-07T07:04:59+01:00,"By: Chisom Cynthia Nnabude
To whom it may concern,
Boys are angels. Men are
God-sent. I understand how magnificent the male child is every time my lungs
expand and contract. The male child is gratified and society knows why. They
have to be sent to school, taught to make money and be go-getters. The male
child from the day they are born are raised to believe they can have it all,
they should want it all and above all, they can get it all.
It is their right to live and
when they’ve achieved it all, they’d be rewarded by marrying a wife who was
created and nurtured just to be married by them. How lucky women are, having an
already made man provide for their every need.
In all honesty, men are a defining
factor of a woman’s life. They’re the one thing that’d justify women’s
existence, the only certificate that matters to women are their marriage
certificate. What other reason were they created for? As a woman, I understood
that. I understood that I was created to be a trophy in my husband’s shelf
because he will have a shelf. He’s not mad to not have a shelf.
I must learn how to cook because
my husband who had been a man without me, a bachelor, will assume the right to
forget how to cook and cater for his own need. He’ll assume the identity of
someone who can only sleep, wake up, get dressed, eat and go to work. And
occasionally decide if I’ve done my share of the wifely duties to earn money
for the house’s upkeep. I was raised my entire life to earn points in my
marriage. It’s a well-crafted game with assigned rules.
Forgetting how to do anything
love related comes in the husband requirement handbook. He only loves you when
he’s courting you and after marriage, the love is still there but there are more
important things. He has to work and provide for the family. Somehow, if your
husband managed to retain the qualities he had during courtship and if he
manages to retain it three months after the wedding, return him to the factory
for resetting. But feel free to keep him if he adds his care and help around
the house to your incompetence or requests to keep it a secret to protect his
male ego.
In the husband requirement handbook, your husband is expected to tell you to stop using the degree you sweated four or more years to get. The degree lecturers and professors used their unique rights and promises to fail and frustrate you before you got it. You’ll get the urge to argue, you might argue but as soon as he makes promises of how he wants you to relax and be cared for like a queen, give in. All the best queens weren’t always queens, so you’ll make a fine and patient wife as you’ve seen the hardship of the world. Sensible girl, a point in your favour.
Remember the main reasons you’re
going to school is so you’d have something to offer in the marriage aside from
your cooking skills. The world has evolved so much that helping your husband in
the farm has been replaced with reading your husband’s work files and providing
assistant to few work-related stresses. Your kids also need to be taught to do
their homework. See how much point you’re getting; I’m dying of pride. In cases
of doubts, refer to the perfect wife handbook.
The perfect wife handbook isn’t
about you. It sounds like it is, right? The only thing about you is in respect
to your husband. Section 26 clearly explains that your husband is not cheating
on you, he doesn’t have it in him. Understand that as a man, he has to burn
stress and he’s understanding in the sense that he doesn’t want to tire you
out. So, he goes to the six girls you have to share him with. It’s pure
mathematics. There are seven girls to one boy, you’re the one that married him.
Hopefully, one of them is dead or became a nun. But he has to be shared for the
world to revolve properly. Don’t be a husband hoarder. If you keep tabs, it
means you don’t trust him, it’ll be motivation for him to cheat. Cheating is
dating girls outside the six of you. You should stop going after the girls.
Asking them to leave your husband is not lady-like. And it’s embarrassing for
him. Just pray that God will come. Besides, the ring is on your finger. You
have the ring and title, what are you complaining about?
That aside, it is of paramount
importance that you remain in shape after giving birth. That flat stomach you
were married with, use the same youthful energy to maintain it. Learn in time
to master your baby’s sleeping habit so your husband can get a good night
sleep. Hold on, you don’t have a child yet. After how many years of marriage?
Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with your womb? Did you sleep with any
Alhaji during your youth? Did you abort any child? It has to be something that
is wrong with you. Don’t even harbour the thought that your husband is the
impotent one. That’s heavily similar to blasphemy.
Hope you read and understood the
part where your body becomes his. It’s simple. If he’s in the mood for sex,
you’re also in the mood. Don’t be ridiculous, he didn’t rape you. Your husband
can’t rape you. He just coaxed you into the mood.  And besides, what made you to not be in the
mood for sex? You’re the first person that to have children and a business?
Don’t forget that his body isn’t
yours, there are six others. Aside from that, he has to lose shape. Pot-belly
is permitted, a clear sign that he has money. Forget all those your teenage
obsession of boys with well-built body. This is reality, your reality. The one
where you work out for two.
Remember being guilt-tripped is
something you have to go through. Understand that you entered marriage, not a safe
haven. You need to take care of him and the kids. Be a maid and a lover. The
only reason you’re breathing, the reason for your existence is him. He’s the
reason there a woman in the first place. And you need to atone for a sin your
kind forced him into committing. Don’t act out of line.
He slapped you. So what? I’m
genuinely confused. All those times he was sent back to beat up his bullies,
what were you thinking was happening? He was learning to stand up for himself,
to not be talked down to. He was learning to be a man. He’s not responsible for
who he became. You’ll get apologies and kisses later. Makeup sex too. Quit
whining and stop calling it abuse. Did you call it abuse when your parents hit
you? Or has the devil decided it was time for you to ruin your family’s name.
You’re not the first person to be hit. And always remember that there are no
abused wives, just wives that let the devil win.
Pray.
As a woman, your entire life had
been created and designed to fit a man’s. You have to bear kids and forfeit
career. You can’t do both. But if you decide career is better, lonely nights
will come. And I hope you have clay and life-giving air plus God’s artistry to
build your own man. Men can’t marry a woman above them it’s unheard of. Refer
to the husbands before them for more details.
As a woman, you’re not an equal. It is irresponsible to believe you can be more. It is unimaginable that you out your husband for hurting you. It is madness that you decide to do more for your life. Just act accordingly. Know who you are and know your place. Act accordingly.

The Nigerian young adult manual,https://punocracy.com/the-nigerian-young-adult-manual/,2020-09-06T08:34:00+01:00,"By: Chisom Clare Akwue
God doesn’t make mistakes, at all. And Nigerians are proof of it. In His all-knowingness, He understood perfectly what being a Nigerian would entail, and on the Eighth day, while every other human specie had become ‘up and functioning’, He made Nigerians, with cement and a resilient spirit to absorb hardship, and melanin, lots of it, to absorb harshness from the sun; a prior preparation for the Herculean task of being Nigerian.
It makes us extraordinary people (whether you take that negatively or positively,na you sabi); that ability to stay strong no matter the situation, especially in the hands of people whom, when the cement was being mixed for their own production, the milk of kindness and humanness finished; the ones we call leaders.
Being a Nigerian is hard. But being a Nigerian young adult is both hard and confusing. For one, you are living as and between the generation that brought Nigeria to where it is today, and the generation that will suffer the effects in the Nigeria of tomorrow. This manual is for you, young fellow, to understand how the system functions with respect to you, and how to survive in it, to avoid unnecessary and undue high blood pressure.
The first rule is to understand that while you think education is the key to success, the doors have either been changed in Nigeria, or there are doors that open to doors that open to success. Besides, if education were that important, schools would be open, like other essential service providers during the lockdown, at least, virtually. Even the president’s senior secondary certificate is at large, so why the fuss about paper? It is not of he that readeth or of he that graduateeth, but of he whom corruption showeth mercy(Naijalations 1:7).
Anyways, since degrees are the ‘in thing’ now, you should just have one, to avoid future unnecessary complications, especially when you want to contest for public office. However, you must note that the duration for pursuing the degree is an estimated time frame that allows only for extension, in case you have set targets for yourself according to age. Factor in two or more years extra for ‘miscellaneous’, to avoid being thrown off balance when ASUU gives you a six month holiday twice a year, or your ‘A is for God, B is for me, C is for my wife’ lecturer decides to grant your degree pursuit long life for refusing to drop some cash, or fellate him in his office.
Secondly, Nigerian soil is to dreams what sandy soil is to plants. You should, as a matter of fact, be more concerned about your survival than your dreams, so that your days may not be cut short by hunger, frustration and depression. Whether it’s a skill, a business, a career, or a course you want to choose, please, let your stomach decide first. Times and situations have made us change direction, from pursuing passion to chasing money.Na person wey get life dey dream.If you follow your dreams alone here,you fit loss.
After your stomach, you must also consider your location. You are not even certain that whether you choose your path based on passion or money, there is the opportunity to ‘make it’. I would have said you go to Lagos, but Lagos has not only become cliché, there are more people in Lagos than space, opportunities and even oxygen. You even deserve the best, and nothing less, and the best form of relationship to have with this country is a long-distance relationship. So, you should aim for places like Canada, China, or anywhere else that has no geographical relationship with Nigeria. (Don’t mind that America’s orange-faced man that has made it difficult to enter America). By all means, just run. Safe journey as you do so. We look forward to seeing your Nigerian flag on your Twitter and Instagram bio as your means of pledging allegiance.
For us in the ‘we die here‘ category, who are not opportune to run, verily, I say unto you, fear not. Nigeria is a land of too many possibilities; too much magic, because, what else explains why a microbiology graduate is working in the bank, or how a lawyer is the Minister of Power, or why we have a citizen who is both the president and the minister of petroleum; an appointee of himself by himself? The point is, no matter what it is you have studied, you can always fit in anywhere.
Flexibility is the second hallmark of a Nigerian. Whenever you see a vacancy or opening, just apply. By now, you must have known that you should have two dozens of your CV and passport photographs handy. Don’t tell yourself, “Oh. They want a graduate with 2:1 and I had a 2:2” or “it’s a bank job, and I studied Engineering”. Apply. Just ensure that your surname rings a bell, or your money introduces you. You are never fully dressed for a job hunt without either or both of them, and if any of your relatives belong to the ‘upper echelon’, you only need one phone call, and you’re well on your way to work the next Monday morning. Bear in mind, however, that there are more chances of your CV being used to wrapsuya,akaraor roasted corn than of you getting the job, because there are people who know what you know, and have applied the same tactics. So, while submitting your applications, better learn one or two things in drop-shipping from China, or prepare to be a religious entrepreneur, feeding off the ‘seeds’ that have been sown in your church, even before their harvest, or maybe get yourself aglucose guardian, or lock your hair, get a cheap tattoo and enter the studio (don’t worry about the lyrics. Sing whatever comes as the spirit leads. Let the beat just be danceable), or at worst, buy a laptop and begin the Lord’s work of making those white people who enslaved our forefathers pay. Ignore that ‘patience is a virtue’ gospel, because you see that patient dog?Hunger don kill am. The opportunistic dog carried his bone andjapaa.
I know that from the time you were born, you have been hearing that you are the future. In fact, even before you were conceived, the saying ‘today’s child is tomorrow’s leader’ had existed. Now, sometimes, whenever you listen to the news, and hear about people, whom you think are closer to their graves than you are to your graduation, and the trillions of dollars they siphon, you get this sensation in your subconscious that you will become president someday, and do so, so, and so. Well, for reality sake, perish such thoughts and revert back to rule three, because those tomorrows won’t come, and they are rather closer to their graves than you are to their offices.
You may want to argue with the Not Too Young to Run Bill, but need I remind you that laws in Nigeria most times, are proof of an existent legislative house more than they are applied? There is an underlying interpretation that provides for two categories of ‘young’ aspirants, and the average Nigerian youth does not fall under any of them.
First, the bill refers to ‘young’ persons, possibly between ages forty to sixty-five with capable pockets and political histories, and not the average thirty year old. And even when the age is below, the pocket can substitute. An expression of interest form in the two major parties in Nigeria cost between ten to twenty million naira, not to talk of other election expenses. (You know better than to contest for any office under any party asides these two, because the rest are end of the year parties).
So how do you expect to get that kind of money? Who is your godfather? Which politician’s child are you friends with, or married to? You have not even been in the corridors of power, and you want to be in power. You think it is the same thing you do when you skip terms and conditions and jump to ‘I accept’? Please we don’t do that here. Those offices are reserved for ‘older’ young persons, or young persons of financial age; the ones that stay in the Nigeria of your dreams, live and marry within their circle, count Rolls Royces and Maseratis, and show uponce onceonline, during Eid, to trend theArewaTwitterhashtag, and leave you wondering what you were doing when they were being sent to their families on Earth.
At this juncture, I therefore admonish us all to remain steadfast, and look forward to the Day of Reckoning, when we shall show God our Nigerian flag, for Him to see that we have been through hell already, and are deserving of some enjoyment in paradise."

Take online courses. Only the ones that give signed certificates. You don’t have to have an interest in or even understand the course. It can also be a course you’d never need; just collect your certificate and post it on social media. Caption itgrowth. Remember the more the certificates you have, the better a person you are.
Post pages of books. Not just any book, bestsellers or the ones with popular authors. If you don’t have books that fit in this category, that’s not a problem, you can borrow from siblings or friends. You don’t have to go through the stress of reading them, just open a random page, and caption it with something Aristotle was reported to have said on the importance of reading books. The more books you pretend to have read, the more you can spread pretend knowledge which is exactly the same thing as actual knowledge.
Comment on every trending topic and state your opinions like they are researched fact, but you have to be careful so you don’t get dragged. Use words like “I’m not going to judge” before going ahead to judge. Use expressions like “no offense”, “let’s leave emotions”, or  “just for laughs, don’t take me seriously” before dropping tribalistic, racist, absurd or otherwise rude comments. Don’t forget to add how it is your opinion and how your freedom of speech isn’t limited.
Make jokes about how you’re horny because of the Covid-19 induced lockdown and social distancing precautions. It doesn’t matter that you weren’t getting it or eating before the pandemic. 2020 was your year of losing your virginity, but don’t tell other people that anyways. The pandemic is taking a lot of things from you already, don’t let it take away your wokeness.
Do a giveaway. Support your friends’ business. Give away their products. You need the products, but the masses need it more. Don’t worry about the payments. You can pay your friends later. That is why you chose to patronize them in the first place. If you run out of friends to be indebted to, do fake giveaways. But be careful, there mustn’t be acaught.
Call everyone on social media an idiot, especially those who get caught flouting the lockdown directives. Turn a blind eye to your parents who go out daily, that one is excusable since they provide you shelter and your daily bread. Embrace your cousins who come to visit, especially those that take public transport; they go through all that just to see you. Besides, it is your family. It’s not possible any of you get infected, you all are the special ones.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has indeed dealt humanity a great blow. Its menace has seen the birth of over 600,000 graves and still counting, led to the crumbling of various struggling economies and ultimately, among many other woes, pillaged the relics of community life which humanity holds dear. However, amidst this ruckus, attention has been drawn towards another titan virus coexisting with the COVID-19 and concurrently proves more fatal. Intel tells us that this virus is endemic; fast spreading across the terrains of Nigeria, and currently has no vaccine. However, ongoing researches have been unable to pinpoint the exact origin of the virus but there are conjectures that this virus is an evolution from the reaction of the COVID-19 virus cells to its current environment with history of high concentration of lethal sociopolitical atmospheric constituents.
THE NATURE OF THE COVIK-19 VIRUS
The COVIK-19 is a custom of the COVID-19 virus. In an attempt for the COVID-19 virus cells to survive and thrive in its newly found environment whose atmosphere is highly concentrated withcorrupium (a gaseous constituent that makes its space fantastically corrupt)and other uncongenial elements, it undergoes certain cellular adaptations. However, it is necessary to clarify that the COVIK-19 and the COVID-19 viruses are not mutually exclusive. This establishes that its current geographical space is left to engage in a war with two truculent viruses concomitantly.
COVIK-19 VIRUS TAXONOMY
Binomial
nomenclature
Family: Corrupriviridae
Subfamily: Corruprivirinae
Realm:
Embeziviria
Phylum: Decartae Structuris
Order:
Naijavirales
Additional
information: The virus thrives well where there are fiscal splurges and
dramatic expansion of public spending paralleled with acute institutional
deficiency with absolutely no credible structure to uphold transparency and
accountability.
OBSERVATIONS
Strangely, this virus can be described as a highly diplomatic one being that it is highly selective in the choice of its hosts and has been flagged to expand the digestive system of its host to feed through it. As though this virus possessed some form of cognitive abilities to distinguish arid lands from green fields, it has been found to have greater affinity for the El Dorados of the country over the larger habitation of poor masses. Though unconfirmed, the exhibition of large belly sizes is a common factor among many of its hosts. Our experts theorize that this is a possible adaptation for the stomach to cater for the expansion of the esophagus whose capacity is now colossal. Research has further proven that the COVIK-19 is rather an esophageal/encephalitis infection than a coronavirus.

ANALYSIS OF COVIK-19 REGULATION NEWS’ REPORT
After much inquiry into the nature of the regulations and laws implemented as a result of the COVIK-19 outbreak, certain hypothesis has been put forward.
REPORT ON REOPENING OF
AIRPORTS
There is a perceived subtle prioritizing of the reopening of airports over lifting bans on interstate travels and intrastate movement. This is much evident in the resumption of domestic flights on July 8 and the volcanic pressure in the attempt of restoring normalcy to the operation of international flights. This to some extent hints that unlike COVID-19, COVIK-19 is inhibited in the lower stratosphere. Hence, airlines are resistant to homing and spreading the virus.
REPORT ON REOPENING OF
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS
The
government embarked on the reopening of religious centers on the 15thof June. However, this came alongside a mound of regulations which included
social distancing and hand washing, congregation quotas and service durations.
This brave development has led to the formulation of certain hypothesis:
REPORT ON DECLARATION OF
CURFEW
After an initial imposition of a nationwide curfew that kicks off at 8 pm and lapses at 4 am, the government later reduced the span on June 2 to last between the hours of 10 pm and 4 am. Emerging from this are the following:
ELECTIONS SET TO HOLD
As COVIK-19 continues its rampage, elections are still set to hold. However, the minister of Education in corroboration with the federal government is on the verge of truncating the conduct of the WAEC examinations in Nigeria. Though unverifiable, COVIK-19 takes special interest in political matters.
REOPENING OF SCHOOLS (on
repeat)
The news on the reopening of schools has been tormenting the media since the earlier periods of the inception of the virus. It is an expectation that is evergreen since it is the hinge on which true normalcy pivots and there are speculations that the virus could have something to do with this. This hints us that COVIK-19 is intelligent and less concerned about education.
CURE AND VACCINATION
As it stands, there are no known treatments for the virus. So far, with information gotten from research, the virus can only be mitigated. There are speculations that certain drugs like the *** are viable treatments, however, this news should be discarded as all tests to prove such have ended in futility.
That test subjectCK1001tested positive for the virus is not an apocalyptic prophesy of doom but rather one that sheds light on our current situation.
Therefore, owing to the emergence of the COVIK-19 virus, we implore the public to observe the following measures:
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
RESEARCH
The
research has helped a great deal in shedding light on our current sociomedical
situations. In line with this, it has opened our eyes to cosmic possibilities
in the evolution of viruses; the limitless importance of the nature of our
political-ecosystem in relation to the influx of external bodies.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The COVIK-19 virus must be seen by all as a threat against humanity and it is our collective responsibility to fight it. This research has given us deep insights into the nature of the virus. However unlikely salvation seems, we the NCDC would continue to work tirelessly and relentlessly towards uncovering the necessary truths behind the nature of this virus. This tempestuous voyage is one we consider as our service to humanity and we would not quit sailing forward.
Stay safe!

A comprehensive guide on how to act straight,https://punocracy.com/comprehensive-guide-on-how-to-act-straight/,2020-09-04T08:13:11+01:00,"By: Ola W. Halim
Dear Gaydarwosky,
I hope this finds you well.
I’m well too, just that I’ve been
ruminating over what you said the last time we talked: “I’m on WikiHow
reading an article on straight-acting.” I vowed not to reply until I found
you some help. To make this happen, I had to examine the trail of ash you’re leaving
behind for people to see, and browsing your Facebook profile and your Medium
articles on self-discovery, the bells started to ring: “This boy is
CLEARLY gay! This boy is clearly GAY!”
So I came up with these, to help you tone
down some colours: seven suggestions on how to act straight in Nigeria.
Caveat: Walls have ears, remember. And anything that has ears surely has a mind. Therefore, I recommend you read thisonlyin your toilet. Your toilet is tiled, not walled—don’t argue; walls arestrictlymud and cement and terracotta—and the last time I checked, tiles didn’t have ears yet. The priority is acting safe, Gaydarwosky. Yes, I know I should have used ‘playing safe’, but man, this is a matter between life and death, so we won’t play with it! Therefore, I advise you put your erudition aside for now, balance your butt on the toilet seat, and we’re good to go.
1. Change Your Name:First, it’s not just about Gaydarwosky, a mere username; it’s about
every feminine name out there. Christening your boychild Mercy, for instance,
could make him gay.
Now, let’s imagine you’re male and Mercy,
and you’re introducing yourself at a bar: “Hi, I’m Mercy. And you?”
If giant bells don’t immediately chime, if maroon lights don’t immediately flicker on 3D screens, if robotic voices don’t immediately purr, “Gay alert! Gay alert! Gay alert!” please unfollow me on Twitter.
And for all the troubles in the world, your
username is Gaydarwosky??? Man, you’re offering your balls to tigers!
Look for tough, manly names, man. Here are
some: BritRock. LivingStud. BedlamHunter. Try pronouncing them. Don’t they
obstruct something in your vocal cavity? Isn’t that why you’re a Nigerian man,
to stir chaos and erect obstacles?
2. Unlike Radical Groups:You don’t want to be tagged gay, yet you like feminist and humanist
and atheist and gamophobic groups on Facebook. What the heaven is wrong with
you, Gaydarwosky?
Gays are womanish, so they support feminism:
the ideology that men should be castrated while women establish afeminiverse.
Gays always play the victim, so they meow for representation under the facade
of humanism: justice for child abusers hinged on the fact that they themselves
were molested as children. Gays don’t believe in God, because God rightfully argues
he didn’t make them gay.
This was what happened: they woke up one
morning and Satan whispered into their ears: “I hereby declare you
gay.” That was just it. How could God, maker of Adam and Eve and not Adam
and Steve or Eve and Maeve, make you gay?
Satan avoids other men because they squirt
stronger anointing, and thus able to resist ‘gayism’. Do you even have
anointing as tiny as a mustard seed? No. Tell me why you wouldn’t remain gay to
people.
For a start, I recommend you start liking patriarchal
and misogynist groups. Also, consider plastering your walls with Christiano
Ronaldo, and screaming the world to its apocalypse whenever Ronaldo hits the
goalpost. You need some Nicki Minaj too. I’m sure even your mother, who abhors
immorality, will be ecstatic. You could transform your house into a brothel;
she’ll gyrate to it, as long as she’s convinced you’re now liking girls and
not—gosh, she even hates pronouncing it!
3. Get a Girlfriend:Don’t you know any guy with ebony skin and hanger-shaped shoulders and
six packs and a lustrous Charlie Chaplin moustache who has no girlfriend is indubitably
gay?
Oh, be scrunching your face there. Don’t
hurry and get a girlfriend. There are girls willing to play fire for a fine boy
like you. Pay one of them to fake it. Start visitingogogorojoints and
talking about how you fuck her in the bathtub and behind the guava trees. To objectify
your stories, grab her shoulders while you click on your camera. Remember, with
Photoshop, the things you can do to an innocent picture are endless.
Chatter about how hollow women are,
especially the ones who wear skimpy blouses and leer at Yahoo boys and huddle
in boys’ hostels only to whimper afterwards on Twitter that they’ve been raped.
Ensure there’s a bespectacled girl at a corner, tucked in a houndstooth suit
and stilettos, a pink comb sticking out of her permed hair. Identify her as
feminist already, and have your friends hurl vocal jabs at her. And when she
coughs, threaten to burst into her and plunge and plunge until her squirt
ripples at your feet. Flex your bulbous biceps when you splutter these words.
Let her feel the veins if need be. Even if your friends catch you sucking a
guy’s dick behind a soakaway pit, they’ll shrug it off because you at least exhibit
manliness (see guide seven).
Other men who squat beside women to condemn
rape are the real gay guys. Or how do you rationalise your continued support
for a specie God ‘fashioned’ from your rib?
4. Repent:Let your pastor baptise you, douse you in water and fetch you out a
new being, scrubbed off your sins. Attend both weekly and Sunday services. Double
your offerings to affirm your straightness, and ensure your pastor notices you
while you do. Later he’ll invite you to his office. He’ll offer you the post of
a treasurer. “My wife can’t cope with the job anymore because of our baby,”
he’ll tell you. But do you even believe anyone can twerk out on such a
lucrative job? (Fact: he never made her treasurer, because you can’t trust your
spouse with money.) With all humility, tell him you’d like to be choir master.
I know you croak like a thirsty frog when you sing, but remember God only discriminates
against gays, not voices.
Another thing, cry to God often. Ensure your mother hears you. You’re hungry and there’s jollof rice in the kitchen? Cry out: “Jesus! Let jollof rice locate me now!” A religious person can never be gay, unless he’s not baptised yet. Once he’s baptised, God says to Satan: “That man’s mine now. I declare your gay declaration upon him void!”
5. Reconsider Your Fashion Sense:You like bright Adidas polos. You nurture cornrows. You keep beak-long
fingernails. And you don’t want your balls torched? Fact: every man who dresses
womanish is gay. Start wearing mainly jeans: black and grey, bereft of BenTenesque
pockets and an intetmesh of chains. Wear white or blue polos. Cut your hair;
wear an afro instead. Trim those nails and sell them to your sisters.
And for God’s sake, stop pouting and
raising your left leg like a wounded billy goat when you take pictures! Stop
caring so much about your face too. Let the pimples invade without bounds; let
them lay eggs in your nostrils if they want. Stop reshaping portions of your
eyebrows too. It’s a red light:gay alert!!!
6. Re-examine The Way You Walk:Real guys stride, slide on the balls of their feet. They keep their
heads straight. They don’t swing their arms unless their hands are tired of
being interred in pockets.
Gay guys don’t even walk; they slither,
like shadows moving on a wall. They twist their bodies like a woman squirming
to an electric man’s touch. They heave their shoulders as if they wouldn’t care
if God unhinges the sky and it collapses on them. They walk in short, too
calculated steps, like they’re renewing consent to keep walking every second.
Gaydarwosky, we both know that’s how you
walk. It’s like a brand: Satan’s graffiti on your forehead. So why won’t people
tick you gay?
Sing about the evils of backsliding in the
church so passionately even the pastor crumbles into tears. I recommend this
song:Master Jesus, Don’t Leave Me Alone.Then let’s see if God won’t
overturn things in a month.
7. Be Manly:Here are some helpful synonyms of ‘manly’: harmoniously aggressive,
romantically domineering, supremely egotistical, coordinatingly self-centred.
Reel off your belt and whomp your younger sister for sizing up your mother. Pocket
a switchblade. And when someone claims to stan Messi over Ronaldo at the viewing
centre, yank out your switchblade and stab the motherfucker.
Virility is also a necessity for political
rallies. The tough guys are the ones politicians baptise in oil dough, not
fidgeting scarecrows posing as men. You’re kneading an American dream over and
over again, but you don’t have a job, yet you don’t want to bulldoze your way
into the political limelight? Fact: all thugs, especially the semi-literate
ones, are potential presidents and governors. Graduates like you are clerks and
butt-wipers in the making.
That’s it, Gaydarwosky. Read and reread
until my words sink. Any questions? You know I’m just a pen away. Write me.
I wish you happy straight-acting!
Yours,
Baddosky.
(P. S. Stop posting birthday pics of muscular guys captioned:Happy birthday, dear. I love you so much.💕💕💕Try:Happy birthday, bro. More dough! 👌👌👌)

Former devil becomes saint after joining party of angels,https://punocracy.com/former-devil-becomes-saint-after-joining-party-of-angels/,2020-09-03T08:49:30+01:00,"HEARTBEAT OF THE NATION (The T.A. Report)― A former good-for-nothing devil, fondly known as Ba Sheggy, has become washed of his countless sins after he recently joined the political party of angels, The T.A. Report gathered.
Ba Sheggy, who is the leader of a state notorious for sending sex expatriates to European countries to boost its economy, is seeking re-election in September and concluded that his camp in hell was too hot for his ambitions.
“I used to hate anything godly so much that I secretly christened myself Godloss,” he revealed at a press conference last week. “But now that I have become born-again, I shall be addressed henceforth as Godwin.”
Chairman of the opposition People’s Angelic Party (PAP), Tony Aziegbe, said they are glad to welcome the former devil into their fold because he gives the Kingdom of God a shot at the state’s top political seat.
“To be frank, we misunderstood a lot of the things Ba Sheggy did while he was still a devil,” he told our correspondent.
“We discovered after he joined our party that he actually meant well with many of his policies and has done a terrific job. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, they say, but we got the road signs all wrong. The horned driver was taking us to paradise all this while.”
Aziegbe added that the former devil’s name has been written in the Book of Life since he paid double for the party’s nomination form and had promised to bless stakeholders with juicy positions within the government corridors if re-elected.
Meanwhile, a former PAP member, Mazi Iyamu, who was initially certified to be incapable of doing any wrong has had his certificate revoked after he joined the ruling devils’ party. He is the leading competition for Ba Sheggy in the coming election.

rest, and the devourers are not bothered about the loved ones it left behind.
So, what’s good about the morning, Alhaji?
‘It will cost you nothing to reply a friendly good morning, like mine, with a nod or a firm handshake. Even the town crier does not leave a message for the people without proper salutation.’
‘If the people were so precious
to the town crier, or his greetings were, why does he, with a bright smile
declare doom on the people still?’
‘Well.’
‘Now you’re stammering, Alhaji. Now, you’re stammering.’
‘Will a man live with sadness all his days? Chief, you’re too young to die of grief.’
‘And what do you consider this life, a morsel oftuwoand a plate ofmasa? No much difference. What’s the worth of a life here? Have you seen the headlines? Have you read the headlines, Alhaji?’
‘The cemetery attendant has seen so much death, the sight of a ghost no longer scares him. Nothing, absolutely nothing scares him. What about the headlines. There’s nothing new.’
‘But Alhaji, you will agree that no matter how beautiful and well crafted a coffin might look, it will not make anyone wish for death. These 86 are not just mere numbers, but people like you and I, people with family members; wives, daughters, loved ones. Is your conscience dead?
‘Not mine. 86? What happened this
time?’
‘Oh! Let’s save rhetorics for
another sad morning. We must find answers to this chaos. It’s sad Alhaji, and
more terrible that Mallam, your brother, is yet to say a word on this matter.’
‘He is now my brother, Chief?
Please don’t turn this discussion to another tribal debate. Please don’t.’
‘But Mallam’s wife said all is
fair in love and war, Alhaji. Your brother is a coward and a weakling, he
should resign.’
‘Chief, we both know that the
Carmel will have to go through the needle’s eye or the gods’ mouthpiece will
have to dance naked at the market square before Mallam resigns, or anybody in
that position. Gaskiya ga Allah, it’s difficult.’
‘Why should it be difficult,
Alhaji? He became a public servant accidentally, why can’t he also leave office
accidentally?’
‘Has Mallam’s wife condemned the
killing on her Twitter page? I heard she’s active there.’
‘(Laughs hysterically) Alhaji!
You hold this family in high esteem, don’t you? Well, she said she wasn’t
elected. She has nothing to say, not even sympathy to give.’
‘Kai! You mean Mallam’s wife said
that?’
‘Looks impossible? She said it.
Can something good come out from Nazareth? I doubt it. Each week with its own
sad news from your region.’
‘Chief, it’s everywhere, you just
can’t guilt trip a region. Is there much difference between the frog and the
toad? The man who left prison as a thief, was welcomed back to the Senate as a
crusader for democracy. Is he from my region? No shame!’
‘Heaven helps those who help
themselves in this country.’
‘Tooh! That’s why we are where we
are. No shame! No shame at all.’
‘Alhaji, I agree with you that the decay stinks everywhere. Nothing is yet to be done to the speaker who embezzled public funds for his girlfriends and concubines. Absolutely nothing! The eagle is blind to this.’
‘The Eagle? He who beats the drum for the mad man to dance is no better than the mad man himself. God forbid anything is done, Chief. He who pays the piper dictates the tune. The elders are fanning his ego.’
‘So many elders these days; no
wonder they now think with the hole in their butt.’
‘I agree with you on this. The
one in Lagos has made himself a demigod; no one dares to touch him.’
‘And that’s why one of his boys
can be caught stealing on camera and the people still hail him. They even go as
far as celebrating him with a chieftancy title. Outright abomination!’
‘It will lead to others striving to seek the favour of this man. See the story of the former comrade.’
‘He who is short has no business
in the tapping of palmwine, or whatever the proverb is, but my comrade has
proven this golden rule wrong.’
‘(Laughs hysterically) He has the
state in his pocket, and the money to buy a pot of soup. The people will dance
to his tune.’
‘Aren’t the people tired of bag
of rice politics? We are too lethargic.’
‘Blessed are the meek for they
shall be comforted. Blessed are the peace makers for theirs is the kingdom of
God. God forbid we riot.’
‘Kai, who do us this kind thing?’
‘The people who call themselves
preachers of love. Love over riot and protest. Karl Max was right after all.’
‘The bag must be secured. Well,
they sell hope.’
‘Hope? That is long gone with
1993.’
‘Nothing has changed. All those
who were involved in that mayhem are all rewarded with pot bellies and big
political offices.’
‘The present one in power even
called the main antagonist of that mayhem a national hero. You hate to see it.’
‘I’ve stopped stressing myself
over him. A man who does not have an ordinary waec certificate. God forbid I
call him my leader.’
‘This country is a narrative of paradoxes. Let him continue playing Jesus and keep granting salvation to repentant terrorists. What a joke.’
‘He who the gods want to destroy, they first make mad.’
‘But it seems the gods reward
those who have fat pockets with fat bellies.’
‘A politician gave his people
rope to tie down their goats as that was his own intervention fund. Can’t you
see that the gods have made us all mad?’
‘And we wonder why the animals
are jealous of these politicians. Why won’t they emulate their deeds. If not
monkey, it’s snake. The one caught on camera was rewarded with a second term.’
‘They are mad!’
‘You dare not speak these words
in public or your disappearance will just be another Twitter hashtag. God
forbid the people protest your disappearance.’
‘I’ll rather die, than sit here
all day and do nothing.’
‘But make sure your death is good
enough for a headline.’
’86 dead. No name, nothing.
People are now reduced to mere numbers.’
‘Tomorrow will come, and we would
have moved on with our normal lives, waiting for another 86.’
‘A chicken-chaser must take a
fall, and a chicken must waddle. God forbid I’m the next.’
‘God keeps forbidding.’
‘Do you still have anyone who
fears God these days? A country where people rape and murder themselves in the
house of God.’
‘[Sigh!]’

trauma, nothing irks us again.’
‘We were all here when a Senator
molested a sales girl on camera. Did anything happen?’
‘Chukwu adighi kpuo isi.’

spectators.’
‘Over my dead body; I’ll rather
die than be silent!’

The commandments for men,https://punocracy.com/the-commandments-for-men/,2020-09-03T07:44:42+01:00,"By: Akindayo Peace Akinwale
1. Know that you are distinct from the sex with lumps in their chests and disrespect worn in their sharp eyes. You must implant this difference in your sons and sons’ sons. After all, they are created in the image of God. In His image created He them.
2. Subject the woman: since Adam, she wasn’t your equal. She was formless until He, God, pulled her from your ribs. She was not to have any form of liberty or identity. She is not to have any form of liberty or identity; for He gave you authority over everything, and so the woman should kneel at your feet and worship you.
3. Let the woman know her body doesn’t belong to her. Let her know that she was pulled from the ribs of men and so she belongs to any man that wants to claim her.
4. Let the woman know that she is selfish if she feels happy or loved without a man. Only men can exercise this much feeling without a woman.
5. A woman must love a man, a man does not love the woman. Only the woman expresses love to a man because it’s the only way to ascertain her wholeness. As a father, teach your daughter to love a man and stick with him regardless of his extremities.
6. Every woman must respect you because you’re a man. On earth, on God, you don’t need to earn their respect.
7. Don’t say thank you or please when you make requests. Why would you bring yourself in the subject of a woman who isn’t your equal? She is neither human, an individual, or a fellow with blood in her veins. If she recognizes with anything human, it’s the luxury you’ve afforded her.
8. A lady cannot reject or renounce a man. Who amongst the black women has she seen reject a man? So do not worry about being rejected by a woman no matter what you ask of her or do to her. Those who reject men don’t get given away in marriage, and every woman wants to get married.
9. Again, you can claim the body of any woman. You don’t need to ask for it. Her body belongs to all men until she’s claimed by one of the good souls.
10. When you approach her and she says NO, pull her hair to your breast and ask if she knows who you are. Remind her that you’re straight. By this, you’re showing her that only you have human rights and dignity.
11. A woman can be flamboyant once she doesn’t intimidate you. A woman must not intimidate a man; she makes him feel unsafe and in need to compete. It is an insult if you compete with a woman (even) in a capitalist society: a man should always be a step ahead of the woman.
12. When she truly says she loves you, know that she just gave you a clean slate to have other lovers. Don’t ever doubt this.
13. Hurt a woman. Hurt the woman. Hurt as many women as you can find. It’s the only way to let them know their place. It’s one of the ways to love a woman.
14. A woman is nothing but a domestic object. Remind yourself of this every time you think a woman can be intelligent like men.
15. Always remember Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari, and make him your role model for the universal patriarchy that the world must regard for a workable international system. Remember that his wife, the First Lady, Aisha, belongs to his kitchen and the other room and that is all she must claim. That’s all every woman should claim.
16. However, let a woman’s intelligence awe you. What? It’s not abnormal to have an intelligent woman. Her intelligence should awe you the way a man’s intelligence doesn’t. You see, it’s your responsibility to remind and make her apply the intelligence in her marital and domestic responsibilities. Make her creative during sex, especially.
17. You must understand, man, you must understand that it’s a woman’s responsibility to make you happy. She is happy when she makes you happy no matter how she does it.
18. You don’t need to appreciate the woman. It’s a great honour that she has you as a friend, an acquaintance, or a senior colleague (never junior). She’ll deem any request or sexual gesture as a chance to make recompense for all the things and creatures you’ve been with her.
19. Do not wish yourself what you wish for a woman. You’re a different kind of human.
20. Let her know that choosing herself over other things is a radical political act and it is outrageous and preposterous. It is condemned!
21. When a lady is all over the place like a man, like a man – because only a man should be all over the place – clip her wings. You know how to do it.
22. Parents, get your radical daughters married! She has lost her sanity when she advocates for feminism, reduction of gender inequality, and violence. Parents have the responsibility to arrange her marriage; let her devote her energy to domestic responsibilities. Keeping her in the family way is the only way to keep her sane.
23. In all the good you must do, know that only you can also make the woman happy. When she’s alone (which she’ll often be), know that only you can brighten her up. She can’t make herself happy, she is incomplete without you.
24. Do not cry for her. Do not pity the woman like feminists do. Feminists have lost their minds and homes to the devil, you haven’t.
25. Know this, do not exercise empathy or sympathy for whatever injustice or suffering she says she passes through. They are natural events in the becoming of a woman. She is happy with the liberty patriarchy poses on her, she just doesn’t know how to admit it. You should be grateful to your penis for the divine happiness yourself and fellows render.
26. A woman doesn’t have burdens. All her burdens are taken care of by men.
27. Again, the woman has no burden. Milking her many children, allowing her husband sex every night, and doing domestic activities is never a burden. If she makes a complaint, it’s a subtle way to tell you to bring another woman to her home, your home.
28. Let a lady feel powerful and she becomes a problem. You should understand this very well; a lot of pleasure and attention makes them feel powerful and in control and it is not right.
29. This society has a lot to teach a woman. This society filled with men and belonging only to men has a lot to teach the women. It is in your place to do what you can.
30. When you see a man who believes in women’s liberty, know that he’s a threat to masculinity and he must, in the worst case, be criticised. You can call him a pussy-hunter or a servant of the butt.
31. Tell everyone you’ve laid with a woman. It is important! Snap an after-sex picture and archive it. Inform family and friends especially if it’s your first. There is nothing savage, preposterous or awful in that: flaunt your medals of achievement because you’ll need it so much in your life.
32. Eventually, a lady is lucky to marry you. You want to make love and she says she’s sore. It’s the time she needs hard sex. You should pin her neck while making love. You should pin her neck to your pillow and fuck her. If she says she can’t breathe when you’re about to climax, it’s irresponsible of you to stop. She can’t die, women have never died from sex because it’s not a disease.
33. The society knows everything those devil incarnates say about forceful sex. We believe that they’re evil people. You have to invalidate any “victim’s” truth, experience, memories, or whatever they call it. Rape can never happen between a man and a woman. Only sex, sexual intercourse.

Becoming a motivational speaker: The surefire way,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-motivational-speaker-the-surefire-way/,2020-09-02T07:57:33+01:00,"By: Agbaje Ayomide
Just in case you may have even been wondering what being a young motivational speaker in a country like ours entails, I want you to know that it is very understandable if indeed you have. And yes, you may have also been wondering,“which way sure pass for dis thing sef?”To start with and before we dive into the ocean of the matter, I need you to first know and scratch that motivational speaking is pure business in Nigeria — an under-exploited one at that. In fact, approach it best as an hustle. And in the bargain, forget about those who say they just have passion for it and love to inspire. So, without much rhetoric, here we have the ultimate guide and the sure plug tohammeras a motivational speaker:
You know, “a closed mouth,” they say “is a closed destiny”. And this can’t be truer, I daresay. To become a motivational speaker, you need to be on top of your branding game and shape people’s perception of you. Be active on all social media platforms, particularly on LinkedIn. Churn out write-ups, especially posts on#MotivationalMonday. Conjure up some rhyming statements in your content to sound deep  — even if they contain no real substance and coherence. Also, have an overly-updated profile filled with lots of top-notch and non-existent roles — even though you’re still unemployed. Attach a catchy headline and long bio of sweet stuff about you, too. Have a flashy professional headshot, preferably one featuring you decked in a spruce suit and tie or corporate wears, beaming your smile to the camera flashes. It is even particularly important that the headshot must have a photo studio background. You will look so fresh and nice. And your audience will see you as rich and big, even though you are not in real sense. All is packaging, or at least a Potemkin village for you. After all, you’re only branding yourself.
Yes,
do it. Cook up a very emotional story of your past life and background. And
brand it. And not just any story; I mean a sweet rags to riches and grass to
grace story. Also, make sure it evokes empathy and has a sweet ending. That’s
the trend in the industry, and what many of your audience will want to hear
from you. People connect more with stories. Don’t even worry if it seems
unrealistic. Tell them how you struggled with a humble background, lived an
impoverished life, kept hopes alive and never gave up till you achieved
success. Tell them how you started a business with zero capital and no team,
and built into a sustainable venture. In fact, exaggerate the story. Spice it
up with emotional triggers. And add salt of quotes like “if you can think
it, you can surely achieve it.” Then, always tell this story at events and
through posts on your social media pages. And yes, let this story be
consistent, so many won’t get your scope. I know you’re asking yourself now,
“what if I don’t have a rags to riches story to tell — or perhaps just
yet?” It’s very fine, boy. The code is that the story you will tell
doesn’t have to be exactly and really true. You dig?
Know
that your worth as a motivational speaker is not in the number of people you
will motivate and impact. Who even cares about that? Rather, your true worth
lies in the number of events you attend and stages you appear on. When your
branding game is smooth, tight and consistent, it is only expected that you
begin to get invites and gig offers to speak at events and motivate an
audience. Remember this is a business, so always ask what the compensation for
you is like. No one speaks for free again. After all, you’re a businessman, and
motivation is what you’re selling. Consequently, attending events will do a
whole lot of good for your motivational speaking business by a long shot. It
will have an overarching effect on your reputation. Your brand visibility will increase.
You will get an appreciation award (or least a certificate) after the event
that you will decorate your wall with, and also snap to post on your social
media handles for the world to see. Your audience at the event will love and
adore you like a celebrity. They will want to know you more and then ask for
your contacts to be in your network. And there is no better feeling than that.
Speaking at an event is a meritorious achievement for your business, and you
should be very proud of it.
Now
that you’re fully into the business, it’s time to step up to the next level and
status. Remember the goal is to subtly and stealthily make money from this
business many are not even looking at yet. And you need to blow and arrive. So,
always find ways to upgrade. Change those your supposed roles in organizations
to new ones. Update, or perhaps overhaul, your social media profiles. Add some
flesh to your bio; make it thicker. You can go extra by also changing your
profile picture to a more dope headshot. Most importantly, change your titles.
The title, Motivational Speaker, will be too common for your liking by then.
Describe yourself as a Thought Leader. Personal Development Coach. Expert
Speaker. Or even a Productivity Strategist. Just make the title a fancy and big
one. That will make you earn respect.
Also, organize a paid webinar. Tag it a masterclass, even though you’re yet to be master in the class. Well, you have built a brand already with the bricks of impression, and shaped people’s perception of you as a knowledgeable and deep somebody. You will be surprised how so much they would like to learn from you. Yes, it doesn’t even matter if what you are planning to deliver in your webinar is exactly what was taught in the one you just attended yourself. And yes, it does not matter if you have not even started applying the lessons. You just want to make money from this business as quickly as you can, and that’s what really matters. The fact is you’re (supposedly) selling your brain for money, and that’s not a bad idea. It’s simply your Midas touch.
Yes,
a motivational book. Be an author. This will only double your hustle, add some
credibility to your brand name, and of course, fetch you cool cash from the
book sales. In the book, emphasize more on your cooked-up story and seek to
inspire people with some cool tips, insights and strategies to improve their
lives — even if you don’t practise them yourself and you’re yet to figure out
your own life. The good news is you don’t even need to be a writer to have a
book to your name. Hire a ghostwriter to do the job for you, and help you start
and finish the writing processes while you proudly enjoy the product. So, get
ready to spend some money on this. Lest I forget, make the title of this book
as catchy as possible. I mean, something like: “How To Make ₦1
million in 3 Days.”
You get?
You are big already, yeah. And that’s a thing of joy. You have found your true path already. And you’re treading it. I mean you have some audience somewhere who now look up to you and what you share on your space to motivate them. And it’s only normal that you now have begun to dream big and be ambitious for fame. You shouldn’t remain a local motivational speaker. Your apical dream is to become a TEDx speaker. But don’t let the thought of it scare you. After all, if you can think it, you can achieve it. You can even start acting the dream. Here is alocus classicus. Post some long motivational contents on your WhatsApp status or do a long thread on Twitter, and then end it with this soft note: “thank you for coming to my TEDx talk.”

"How to replace doctors on strike: A fool, proof guide",https://punocracy.com/how-to-replace-doctors-on-strike-a-fool-proof-guide/,2020-09-02T07:47:39+01:00,"By: Adeyomola Kazeem
Meanister:Oga, the doctors said they want their hazard allowance and PPE.
Oga: Did they come with guns?
Meanister: No.
Oga: Have they killed people continually for over a
decade?
Meanister: No.Oga,
on the contrary, they have been saving lives for decades.
Oga: Have they ever displaced a thousand families from
their homes?
Meanister:Oga, no o. They even help make life easy for the displaced people.
Oga: Okay, Okay, how many people have they kidnapped in
the last 5 years?
Meanister: Zero,Oga. Kidnapke? These ones swore an oath to always be selfless. If their patients don’t eat, they won’t eat.
Oga: Sack all of them, all of them, we do not negotiate
with people who are not terrorists. Such insolence. How do we know they are
serious if they are saving lives and not destroying them? If they are not
detonating bombs everywhere, how do they expect us to hear them and negotiate
with them?
Oga:In 2023, we’ll set up a committee thatwill set up a committeethat will come up with a master plan to replace these ones. My vision is to ensure that we can start selling medical degrees in traffic for free or for a fee. I’m thinking we should start with a promo that if people buy a B. Pharm, they should get MBBS or BNSc asjara.
Oga:And if you look properlygan, what are these medical people doing that Google can’t do. Is
it not the same cosmetic surgery Dr. Sh-Anu is doing effortlessly? They will
tell you that what she does kills. But it’s just all these opposition doctors
that are always wailing. Look at the child of tea (omo-tea) for instance, the
valley in her waist is where the indictment on Dr. Sh-Anu falls to waste. Don’t
make a mistake, if she wears a waist trainer, the trainer is not training her
waist, she is training the waist trainer on how to train waists.
Oga:Mr.Meanister.
Meanister:Oga.
Oga: Help me open my Instagram page. The@Oga_looking_awayaccount.
Oga: Meanister,can you see what I’m saying? See all these skincare experts now.Boyawe should set up a medical school on Instagram. Because see smooth skin now. It is quite creative that these experts give their potions other names asides the default name.
Meanister: Oga, what is the default name?
Oga:The default name is Filtersna. You are not even very current. Such creativity with names
cannot be replicated by these ones asking for better pay. Our administration
will only remunerate creativity or at least we will promise to.
Oga:SoMeanister,
we already have Dermatologists and Surgeons. Let’s find replacements for
another specialty.
Meanister: My Lord, may I? May I? May I narrate this story, my Lord?
Meanister:15 years ago, before I becameMeanister, I had this troubling backache and it was troubling me, sir. I went to many of these our government-owned hospitals but nothing healed me. They used to tell me to do an X-ray but the X-ray people used to give different excuses every day. Sometimes they will say the machine is not working. Other times, they will say there is no light and the gen. is not working. Until the day I entered one TATA bus, sir.
God sent this man to me because the drug he peddled
was all-efficacious. He mentioned 30 diseases the drug was indicated for. I
confirmed the potency when I used it on myself.
Oga:So, you are saying that we can use those ones as a
replacement for the pharmacists?
Meanister:Exactly,Oga.
Oga:So, how do you think we can replace the Nurses?
Meanister:That one is very easy. If we search in many religious buildings, we will find midwives and maternity nurses. I have always wondered why we only employ people with tertiary school degrees. I even had one nurse that used to treat me 20 years ago. She used to give me chloroquine injection whenever I had malaria. The funny thing is, she could never spell chloroquine but did I die? So, we don’t even have to deliberate this thing.
Oga:That’s even good. We shall go with these suggestions.
All these ones will not ask us to buy MRI machines or improve the operating
rooms. I am suspicious that these ones on strike always that people fall sick
so they can indict us when we don’t give in to their requests. They should go
and ask how much they pay their colleagues in Cuba.
Oga:See let’s move to discussions about that expressway that has been under reconstruction since 1999. We need a new excuse, do you have an idea we can use?

Longlist: 2020 Punocracy Prize for Satire,https://punocracy.com/longlist-2020/,2020-09-01T09:02:20+01:00,"It’s been about two months since we shut the windows to applications for this year’s prize for satire writing competition and it gives us great pleasure to finally announce the longlist of 50. All the entries in this list will be published gradually on the website (we hope you enjoy reading them as much as we did), after which the shortlisted articles will be revealed.
Last year, thelonglisthad a total of 38 articles and this time it is a bit longer because of the quality of entries received. (This means a lot to us since it reflects a significant increase in satirical literacy among the young population.) It was extremely difficult coming up with this list and we fully recognise that a lot of great submissions are still left out.
Just like in 2019, during the preliminary assessment, we had six judges evaluate all the applications, after dividing them into three sets with two judges assigned to each set.
The shortlist contains the five best entries in each of the sets, based on the average score, as well as the next five best using overall grades (to allow for variations in the judges’ discretion in awarding scores). And it is the entries in this list that qualify for the second level of assessment, handled by by distinguished jurors,Chuma Nwokolo, lawyer, publisher, and author ofDiaries of a Dead African,The Extinction of Menai, and other books; andElnathan John, lawyer, satirist, and author ofBe(com)ing Nigerian: A Guide,Born on a Tuesday, and other books.
We also cannot wait to find out who the top three entrants are. But, in the meantime, here are the applicants who made it to the 33rd percentile:
We, sadly, did not receive enough entries for the visual art category to make it truly competitive and will let the applicants know what our decision is in the coming days.
Please note that entries that did not qualify for the longlist can be shared with us to be considered for publication. We will be glad to push them to our site too as guest articles.
Cheers to little victories and long lists!"
Criminal responsibility in Nigeria: The Devil did it!,https://punocracy.com/criminal-responsibility-in-nigeria-the-devil-did-it/,2020-08-25T09:41:18+01:00,"The concept of criminal responsibility relates to liability for the commission of an offence under the law. Criminal responsibility questions whether or not an accused person intended the consequences of their actions or whether an accused person, as at the time of committing the alleged offence, had the mental capacity to truly differentiate between right or wrong in relation to their potentially criminal conduct.
In
Nigeria, the Criminal Code in sections 22 to 36 copiously provides for
instances of what may or may not constitute criminal responsibility in Nigeria.
Despite these exhaustive provisions however, in Nigeria still, the devil is
responsible for all crimes.
Rape, stealing, kidnapping, armed robbery, you name it… The common refrain amongst the perpetrators of these crimes in instances where they have been apprehended is thus, “the devil made me do it”, “it is the work of the devil…”
Where
they have not been apprehended, particularly in situations with little or no
proof against them, the devil is the one after them, trying to pull down all
that they have built via these allegations of crime.
Amidst
all these allegations and counter-allegations, the questions that frequently occur
to me are these:
Are
they not the fight? Are they not the war? Why can’t they take the fight to the
devil and bust his reign of terror once and for all on all our behalves?
We are a churchgoing, mosque-attending, Ogun-worshipping population, so apprehending the devil in the commission of these crimes should not be a problem for us if we pool our collective belief and spirituality together.
Abi, mi o make sense ni?"
Outspoken Nigerian activist keeps forgetting she’s married to the president,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-activist-forgetting-shes-married-president/,2020-08-24T07:11:51+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― A prominent advocate for good governance in Nigeria, Ayesha Bwari, has admitted she sometimes forgets she is, in fact, the country’s first lady.
The activist, who came into limelight in the run-up to the 2015 general elections, recentlylecturedhealthcare providers on how they could help reduce medical trips abroad ― right after returning from one herself.
“I recall hosting the private healthcare Providers earlier in the year and we had a very productive engagement where the issue of building the capacity of Nigeria health sector was the major focus, and funding was discovered to be the major challenge,” she observed on Friday.
Later speaking to our correspondent, Ms Bwari said it had ― “funny enough” ― not crossed her mind her husband, coincidentally also the President, could do something about the funding challenge.
“Ah! Why did I not think of that?” she asked rhetorically. “To tell you the truth, I keep forgetting that I am a member of the first family.”
“You see, aside from the aides, bodyguards, convoys, high-level meetings, and occasional trips abroad, I try to keep a low profile.”
She further explained that, as an activist, she must not shy away from any opportunity to call out whatever is wrong with Nigeria ― “even if we share the same bed with them”.
Ms Bwari had had to travel to Dubai for treatment after complaining of “severe neck pain”. She had publicly complained in 2017 about the lack of essential equipment at the villa clinic, which unfortunatelyforced herto “go to a hospital owned and operated by foreigners 100 per cent”. She has since realised even this is not enough.
The T.A. Report gathered that there is an unwritten rule at the presidential villa that all illnesses designated as “severe” must be treated in foreign hospitals only.
“People have been flown abroad in the past because of severe catarrh, severe loss of appetite, and even severe minor injuries,” one source told our reporter. “We just cannot take chances with the local health infrastructure destroyed by the opposition party.”
Meanwhile, experts have suggested the unusual pain experienced by the first lady might be because “she often stretches her neck to look for solutions outside the presidential villa when they are right beside her”. Given her recent press statement, they added, Nigerians should expect that more state resources will be spent on additional trips to the United Arab Emirates.

How to be a respected female in Nigeria | Ololade Ajekigbe,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-respected-female-in-nigeria/,2020-08-22T09:44:44+01:00,"For the purpose of this article, let me quickly clarify that in this context, “female” refers to a lady/woman who’s 25 years of age and above. Now, regardless of your background, qualifications, achievements, physical appearance or social standing, to be considered worthy of respect (which naturally translates to being successful) as a female in Nigeria, you have to first of all understand the peculiarity of the society you live in. And not just that, you must be willing to align your way of life to the realities of the Nigerian society. But, you need not worry about it. I’m here to lend a helping hand as I discuss five foolproof ways to ensure you are respected as a woman in Nigeria. Let’s get right into it!
Get married:Let no one deceive you, if you plan to remain single for a long time or even forever, then you must be ready to entertain snide remarks and different shades of marginalization all through your days. As long as you live in these climes. It really doesn’t matter if you make history as the first female rocket scientist to ever come out of the country. It hardly counts if you have an enviable career, a family that loves you, or are named among the Forbes richest in the world; without that little “cuff” around your fourth finger, you’re zilch. Nothing. Nada.
Look, your girlfriend’s husband might be the greatest drunk, a wife-beater, an irresponsible father, serial cheater or even a jail bird, guess what? She will be more respected than you with all your degrees, humanitarian efforts and high-flying career because she is married, and that’s all that matters. Karl Marx may have fingered religion as the opium of the masses. But, I dare say that in Nigeria, marriage is the opium of the people. It is the panacea for all real and imagined problems. You want to be respected? Just get married dammit!
Learn to cook:What’s the value of a woman if she can’t cook? That’s the age-old unwritten slogan of the Nigerian society. It is in the hidden section of the Nigerian constitution. To be considered a complete woman, thou shalt be able to “throw down” in the kitchen. I must emphasize that throwing down in the kitchen is not the same as an ability to make “run-of-the-mill” meals like yam and eggs or rice and stew. I am referring to a dexterity in the preparation of a variety of soups from different parts of the country. Soups in the mould of efo riro, edikaikong, oha and the rest of them, that will ensure the other woman never gets the chance to lure your man away with food.
Defer to every man:The two most popular religions in Nigeria admonish women to submit to their husbands. That one man that she is married to. But, the unwritten rule in my country is that women should submit to all men, whether she is married or related to them or not. And so, when a random guy cuts into your lane abruptly in traffic, suck it up and move on, for he is a man. He has your “type” at home who worships at his feet everyday. Even when you are his boss in the office, you should learn to accord him a level of respect higher than what you show your female subordinates who are his contemporaries. When you are involved in an argument or discussion with a group of men, don’t be too opinionated. Topics like politics, football, and the latest cutting edge technology cannot be your forte. By virtue of the greater physical strength and penis the man possesses, he is technically superior to you. When you defer to every man regardless of their age or status, then you are a good woman who has earned her respect.
Don’t be too ambitious:You are allowed to get a first degree, maybe even a masters degree. But, a PhD? That’s going too far, particularly if you’re a singleton. What exactly are you trying to do? Chase the men away? Intimidate them? You’re a woman, you don’t need to be too ambitious. If you end up as part of the top management in your organization, then be ready to contend with rumors that you either slept your way to the top, or are a modern day Margaret Thatcher who wears the pants on the home front, or that your career success must be responsible for your status as a single mum or divorcee. You cannot have everything, so say my people. Downplay your achievements and successes if you want to be respected as a female in Nigeria. Better still, be ordinary.
Excesses are not for you:In everything you do, remember that you are not allowed to have excesses, and if you cannot help them, be careful not to display them. You may be wondering what is regarded as “excesses.” Well, habits like smoking and drinking which are common to the menfolk should not be associated with you. As a lady, you are expected to be demure. Modesty should be your watchword. How dare you smoke in public? How can you down a bottle of beer with the guys when you are supposed to cut the image of a responsible mother or future mother. Forget that habits are what they are – habits, and anyone can pick them up regardless of their gender. Don’t use curse words, don’t wear mini-skirts, don’t apply too much make-up, don’t laugh out loud. You are a woman, excesses are not for you!
There may be more, but, I can safely affirm that these are the basic factors you need to be a respected woman in Nigeria. If you have them covered, you are well on your way to being the model woman in these parts. The older folks and a huge number of men will encourage teenagers and younger adult females to emulate your lifestyle.
You may choke at some point for allowing society dictate a lifestyle that is not yours to you. You may lead an ordinary life, but at least you will fit in and not be tagged a rebel; or worse still an angry, sexually-frustrated feminist.

How to woman your man,https://punocracy.com/how-to-woman-your-man/,2020-08-22T09:14:19+01:00,"By: Musa Faridat
Today marks my 25th wedding anniversary. Twenty-five years that I have lived with my man. This longevity I celebrate today only came as a result of my unflinching assertiveness. From my reservoir of experience, I will be sharing a few lessons with you. Lessons that if you adopt, ladies, your marriage will be just as lengthy—if not lengthier— and merry.
My man was the easiest of all the men my
father ever groomed for me. This practice of grooming transcends generations in
my family line. Those before him were over-exposed and wouldn’t comply with
instructions. One even had the balls to resist my father’s beatings. Men who
can not withstand abuse are not for you, queen. Usually, this training lasts about
two months but his was shorter because he adapted to the life faster. How did
that happen?
Before the training, I strategized with my father to cut down the frequency of his punishments, and not overburden him with chores. Then I saved the rest for marriage. What is marriage without some little blows and punches? Bland. Since handling domestic chores are encoded in his genes, I made sure to never lend my assistance, or employ one. I never allowed the use of kitchen appliances. They made the work incredibly fast, giving him more idle time. Trust me, no good comes from an idle husband. Which is why I wonder why grown up men should be buying take-out food. That is absolutely irresponsible and the first sign of laziness in a man. Don’t marry those types. My husband complained about the work sometimes in the past, but I shunned him each time because my father did more work in my mother’s house.
When I received the call that he was
proficient in Suffering in Silence, I was elated because I knew he was the one.
Suffering is my love language and I have always wanted to be loved recklessly.
His type are becoming so rare these days. Laziness was not in his blood, or at
least my father dealt it out. I proposed shortly after in the presence of both
families to deny him the remote option of saying ‘no’. A woman never accepts ‘no’.
Even if he tried it, his family would have spoken sense to him.
The wedding was the last time he ever saw
some of his friends, because I changed his phone and SIM card to avoid
interference of friends I don’t approve of. Men gossip when they are in their
company, sharing rebellious advice that will overthrow your supremacy. You
would need his silence. His silence establishes and prolongs your dominance.
You need an unreserved submission from him, the type our forefathers had for
their wives. His only friend was my friend’s husband. Her husband demanded a divorce
when she became too weak with romance. At the moment, he has no friends and we
are better for it. Ladies, don’t lose your guard.
A week into our union, he tendered a resignation at his job that paid almost four times mine on my request. All his properties were readdressed as mine. Although he was skeptical at first, I taught him that his earning more threatened my authority and that wasn’t good for my temperament. If I didn’t pressure him to relinquish his livelihood and properties, he would have left me since because of the financial freedom he would have been enjoying. By the way, how would I have shone if I didn’t dim his light? He learnt my ego came first, before his dreams and opinions. Queens, make your husband learn this by all means and only then will you, both, work like a well-oiled machine.
Later on, I let him apply for a less demanding job which, of course, pays less than mine because I needed the extra cash. His salary was paid directly into my account. I paid him a paltry stipend only during weeks that he was obedient and worked hard enough to earn it. Literally, he has to ‘yes ma, yes ma’ his way to footing his most basic needs. More women should cultivate the habit of keeping their men at home. If this was the case, men won’t be sharing office spaces and car parking spaces with us. Our femininity is on the verge of obliteration. Keep your men where they belong.
Many times he suspected I was cheating because I made zero efforts to hide my track. I owed him no explanation and still don’t. Polygamy is an African thing and the line between adultery and polygamy is very faint. He confronted me about it when I was not in the mood once and I reminded him body no be firewood. He confronted me another time when I was in my mood; I tenderized his body with whips and punches as I should have. One time when he was overzealous, he ran to his mother’s house to seek refuge but his father scolded him, then begged me to accept him. He too — his father — knew that women will always be women.
As a woman, you can not go about apologizing for everything you do. You don’t even owe him an explanation to begin with. You are an Alpha being, so act like it. If he offends you, make him apologize to you. If you offend him, that is only because he incited your provocation, make him apologize too. There will be times when you correct him a little too hard, pacify him with gifts. Men seem okay but, deep down, they all need presents. In all your dealings with him, never be sorry.
You must never buy him fitted clothings.
That is very wrong. His clothes must be oversized. You don’t want his outlines
seducing anyone, especially if he is aesthetically pleasing. If he has beards,
please shave it bald. That is his natural makeup. Or just remand him in purdah
compulsorily. Freedom is a no no. He does not own his freedom anymore. He
signed it over by accepting your proposal and exchanged it officially, with the
bogus groom price his kinsmen charged me, during the wedding.
He shouldn’t have any say in how many
children both of you will make, and mustn’t be allowed to use protection for
any reason. That is abortion, a sin in the realm of men. He shouldn’t even be
able to afford it with his measly stipend. Also, that could mean he’s been
using the protection to cover his extramarital affair. Be very critical. Ask
him where he learnt about contraceptives. Beat your answer out of him. Why will
you cheat and he will cheat too? Who is the master? Exorcise that adulterous
spirit out of his body.
Taking care of the children is his job. Like every other chore, this one is also encoded in his genes. Men are better caregivers because they are overtly emotional. For this reason, you should abandon the entire workload to him. On the flip side, you are an emotionally distant species, hence maintain physical distance too. Bury your eyes in the news while she struggles to calm one child after the other. He can multitask, providing care for as many as ten children. A whole you must not change diaper and wash feces from your toddler’s anus. It is unheard of. One time, my husband conjured an idea that involved me taking a step back — to manage the kids — so he could further his education. He said he wanted to be a trailblazer and I told him to go blaze those trails in the kitchen. Men will put insane things in your head but please don’t pay attention.
Forget what Koffee said. Gratitude is
anything but a must. You must never praise his cooking. It would make you less
woman. The salt or oil must be too much at every point in time. This particular
tip makes them sad and men look beautiful wearing a gloomy face. If he perfects
the meal, go for his appearance. Ask him why he smells of tumeric, sweat and
smoke. Ask him why he looks raggedy. Because why for the life of your wife will
you work all day and not have time to look nice for her? As a man, you should
always to dress seductively to keep your wife. She saw many men but settled for
you. For that you should be grateful! She might have casual affairs outside but
you are the one in her house.
Now to your couple games. When your friends
come around, make sure you busy your husband with errands to keep him running
about like he is playing catch, but with orders. If he does one thing wrong,
insult him and enable your friends to jeer along. If he scrunches his face or
murmurs, strike him without mercy till your friends beg you to stop. Your
reputation will be at stake if you don’t react with rage. Put him in his place.
You are the head and he is the neck.
A journalist said that women should seek
clarity on ways to not tie their identity to oppressing men. But I am here to
tell you to discard that message. Your wholeness is entangled with oppressing
men. You don’t need any clarity on how to woman your home. If your husband does
anything innovative despite all the restrictions, you don’t have any choice but
to destroy it. That is him reimagining his life. Coerce him into stopping that
imagination. Your life will never remain the same if you allow him some space.
You give him an inch and the next time, he is asking for nine. History
validates this. Men asked for a right to education then a right to vote, then a
right to use contraceptives and now, they want equal and fair opportunities.
What are we left with if we give them everything?
Lastly, romance is toxic and has no place in your marriage. Avoid using endearments whether inside the house or outside. Romance is for the weak. You are not a woman of love. Your children’s feelings don’t matter in the grand scheme. Pass this legacy to them. Run your house in a manner that boys resign to servitude and your girls feel entitled to this service, commanding it but never willing to return it. Warn your girls that when time comes to rebrand our mandate, they should do it craftily; enticing from afar but the content still very intact and original. Longevity is the only prize, strive for it.

He disclosed this during the International Youth celebration held at new banquet hall, Makurdi. His words: “Let me say here that the leaders in this country have failed, me inclusive. It Is a big shame to us leaders, we must ask for forgiveness from God. And I implore you that you shouldn’t take after us. Greed is a big challenge. The path we are toying is the wrong one for us. There is a challenge. “The rule of law is selective, there are sacred cows that cannot be touched, even if they do bad things, they cannot be touched.
The 2015 Financial Report of the office is currently being scrutinised by the Senate Public Accounts Committee for investigation. The report said the management of the Nigerian Law School illegally paid N32m to the account of an unnamed cleaner over a period of 12 months. The Auditor-General report also queried the payment of N36m as dressing allowance of 52 workers to the account of a single member of staff in violation of Nigeria’s Financial Act.
His words: “Monitoring activities indicate that in the recent time, some broadcast stations have abdicated their editorial responsibilities such that guests and callers on programmes abuse and insult leaders and those in authority freely and without caution. “To denigrate our elders and leaders in abusive terms is not our culture. We respect our leaders as a positive cultural value. “We expect Broadcasters, especially anchors to show professionalism in the handling of programmes such that guest or callers that exhibit such tendency are professionally handled.
Ganduje, who said his administration is committed to the fight against corruption, urged the commission not to compromise in the anti-graft war. “Whosoever falls into the commission’s trap should face the consequence. I will have nothing to do with it. I will not interfere with any case whosoever might be involved,” he said. In 2018, videos of Gandujecollecting kickbackfrom contractors went viral. The videos published by Daily Nigerian, an online newspaper, showed the governor receiving bundles of dollars and stuffing them inside his pocket.
The Nigeria Police Counter-terrorism operatives have rescued two soldiers earlier abducted by Boko Haram fighters in Borno State. PRNigeria gathered that the terrorists had killed some security personnel and abducted others after an attack on soldiers on a patrol. This comes after Nigerian troops repelled an attempt by terrorists to seize an army barrack in Maiduguri on Monday.
Ehanire said, “I think we are one of the few countries giving hazard allowance. This UK where they are going, there is no hazard allowance, they don’t give doctors hazard allowance but you just get you salary, that is all because I have spoken to the doctors there.

The letter reads partly, “In line with the provisions of the Former Governors Forum and based on the unanimous decision of the Executive Committee of the Forum, we convey to you your appointment as Patron of the Forum. The Forum recognises your role not only as a former governor but equally as a respected elder statesman with passion for the promotion of unity in Nigeria, which is the major objective of the Forum. In addition, your role as Patron will be invaluable in the development of good leadership qualities among emerging leaders in Nigeria.”
The ongoing investigations of loans taken by the Federal Government could send the wrong signal to the lenders, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amechi has said. Mr Amaechi made the observation at an investigative hearing organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Treaties, Protocols and Agreements in Abuja. He said the investigation could cause foreign partners to withdraw such loan facilities which would have a negative effect on Nigeria’s infrastructural development.
An African group of professionals called African Professionals Renaissance Network, (APREN), based in Dakar, Senegal, has selected Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje as the Best Performing Governor in Nigeria, in the fight against COVID-19.

Excelling in WAEC with no worries,https://punocracy.com/excelling-in-waec-with-no-worries/,2020-08-14T07:53:03+01:00,"By: Jonathan Ukor
It’s been four months since our students last put on their school uniforms. Four months is a very long time — even longer when spent indoors and in idleness. You can’t imagine the lockdown tales of these students as they resume back to school. Some say they miss school, some would rather continue selling Indomie and provisions in mommy’s store. And there are those, girls of circumstances, who will become mothers come January. Also, the boys of benefits, who are the talk of the town and soon to be the talk of the EFCC. They all have peculiar lockdown tales to tell.
But schools have reopened and the cardinal certification examination will commence next week Monday. The “cruel” examination council isn’t taking it lightly on our students either. How dare they slate mathematics for first paper after four long months of video gaming, retailing, hustling, pleasuring, face-mask hawking, crypto trading, and footballing? Don’t they have conscience? I wonder.
Now our students are full of anxiety. Amidst the joy of returning to school and seeing friendly faces that they miss, there is that fear that mathematics is on Monday. These students are geniuses though. It is evident in their eyes that help will come from the Lord (or from Mr Ajayi the math teacher). The math teacher had given them AOCs (assurance of commitment). In his words,“You students have nothing to worry about; the school has spoken with your parents. Just read here and here and here, leave the rest to the Lord (and to me).”
You see how progressive the Nigerian education system is. So remarkably progressive the whole world should adopt the system. The success of our students is the sole aim of all stakeholders in the education system. And who should be “awarded this blame?” Do we award the blame to parents, schools, teachers, students or the examination council? I wonder.
But parents have done their best, really. The few who have keen interest in quality education have gone the long length to provide support and to pay whatever fees required for the success of their child(ren). Despite the state of the economy, theConcerned Parents Association of Nigerian Students (CPANS),as part of their SDG campaign, donated a huge sum for examiners’ welfarism. How generous! The school proprietor wrote a two-page letter expressing truest appreciation for the thoughtfulness of these parents.
Teachers are beneficiaries too. For months now, they have abandoned the chalk and have embraced the hoe and cutlass to survive. Life has been hard, but not anymore. With this miracle of school reopening, teachers can smile again.
Our students are the golden eggs. Although, they still have to dress in those tightly fitted uniforms. They still have to read (or pretend to read), and be secondary school students just this last time. They still have mathematics to write on Monday.“Nothing to worry about, the good Lord works in mysterious ways.”"
#SouthernKadunaLivesMatter: But the lives of our security personnel matter more,https://punocracy.com/southern-kaduna-lives-matter-but/,2020-08-09T09:25:49+01:00,"For the umpteenth time, Southern Kaduna is making headlines for the wrong reasons. Brutality and carnage is the new normal there, all the while as human life fares just as good as the dignified life of a poultry specie.
In the midst of the gloom, there seems to be something beautiful to hold on to – the realization that the lives of the men and women of our security forces matter more than those they are tasked with securing. It is in light of this great discovery that the powers that be have saddled them (security forces) with the noble task of nipping in the bud a peaceful protest against the reign of terror in their (Southern Kaduna) sub-region rather than employing what is left of their military “might” to stamp out the elements that do not wish Southern Kaduna, Nigeria and humanity well.
You may recall that it is on record that in a bid to
underscore the fact that the lives of the men and officers of our security forces
is of utmost importance, a certain occupant of the Sir Kashim Ibrahim House
took it upon himself to expend the revenue of his taxpayers on murderers who
deserve to hang for taking law into their hands, instead of risking the lives
of our men and officers by embarking on a futile exercise to bring them to
justice.
As expected, he was made to suffer the slings and
arrows of scathing criticisms despite his noble intentions. Little did his
critics know that he was only being prudent – a stratagem stolen fromThe
Art of War(by Sun Tzu) to the effect that the ultimate art of warfare is
ensuring victory without exhausting your energy or recording any casualty.
From an economic standpoint, the resources committed
to the training of our personnel make it unhealthy and imprudent to send them
to early graves without them doing much for a country that has given them more
than they expected and needed.
A respected gentleman in the ministry informed me that
it takes an average of 950 million naira to develop the job application online
portal. Providing training kits for the duration of their training, I was
informed, amounts to 15 billion naira. It takes 10 thousand naira to feed a trainee
per day. In the course of training, the medical care they receive is the best
you can never get in the country, with the cost stated around 200 billion
naira. Upon qualifying as men and officers, they receive wares valued at a
minimum of 200 thousand naira per head. Feel free to calculate the cost of
training a hundred thousand personnel. By my rough calculation, if we factor in
the allowances due to trainers and what we term “miscellaneous expenses”, we
would arrive at a figure counting in hundreds of trillions of naira.
Certainly government has not spent that much on the
people of Southern Kaduna to warrant the government to risk the lives of its
security personnel in order to protect their lives. This is not an issue of
deciding who lives and who dies. Rather it is giving priority to a greater good
– in this case, the cost of training and recruiting those who would fill the
vacuum that would have been left by the security personnel killed.
Of “recent”, we were made to stomach the news of the mutiny by some soldiers in the vanguard of the unending war againstBoko Haram. It is bad PR for this country to record another show of discontent by our security forces over the unnecessary killings of their comrades in a conflict that is not theirs and about which they have not expressed any wish to meddle in. They have always maintained that they are comfortable serving as gatemen for the politicians ruling and ruining this country and being in the security detail of their convoy as they go about displaying their godlike status.
I may be wrong in my view. But I need to know: How do
we explain the fact that in an area where 24 hours curfew has been in active
mode for months, monstrous men that know no mercy are having a field day in an area
that is under the surveillance of our able and capable men and women of our
security forces? In answering my poser, I dare to say: Let us let them be,
please!They cannot come and go and kill their selves.
Forget the muscles they parade around and the
sophisticated firearms they carry about, they also like life and have
girlfriends, wives, children, parents and many dependents. Why should they risk
their lives for a life that is not theirs? They are not Jesus and moreover,
Jesus’ sacrificial offering of himself was a one-off, final and complete and as
such there remaineth no more sacrifice that is required.
Some would say patriotism and the sense of duty
demands that they make sacrifices for the peace and welfare of the country but
if I may bluntly ask in Nigerian Pidgin English:Who Naija help?
I commend our security personnel in Kaduna for proving
they are still useful by roughing up people whose grievous and outrageous crime
is to go out to protest the persistent threats to their lives and properties. They
have shown that they are powerful to the extent that they can choose the
battles they wish to fight and to also watch as callous men beat people without
any intervention from them and that they can still force the people not to cry.
In conclusion, it is beyond reproach and any peradventure that #SouthernKadunaLivesMatter but it is also true that the lives of our security personnel – who are excellent at silencing innocent and helpless citizens – matter more."
How to be a celebrity | Ololade Ajekigbe,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-celebrity-ololade-ajekigbe/,2020-08-05T08:56:32+01:00,"First, it was Davido practically bringing proceedings to a halt at the NYSC Orientation Camp in Lagos, next, The Africa Magic Viewer’s Choice Awards held last Saturday, and so it’s a good time to talk about celebrities and what makes them tick. The life of the rich and famous is as intriguing as it is attractive.
Many crave the lifestyle and attention that famous people attract. The perks and, many times, the frustration of being a popular face–being recognised everywhere you go, living with the reality of bidding goodbye to an anonymous lifestyle, bearing the pressure of often unrealistic fan expectations, and almost always being only one step away from controversy or a scandal.
Nevertheless, celebrities remain the special breed of humans many others would give an arm to be like. It’s not hard to reckon why: They never seem to lack the panache, looks, beautiful clothes, exotic items of vanity, and of course, the privilege that comes with being a known face.
Celebrities seem to own the world, and the rest of us are just living in it.
The good news is that you can live like a celebrity. Yes, you can, as long as you can pull off acting like them.
To be a celebrity, you must embrace the following ways of doing things;
Court controversy:The biggest celebrities all over the world are constantly in the news on account of one controversy or the other. Celebrities are anything but boring, and to come across as one, you must do all you can to remain in the spotlight by courting controversy as often as possible. So, think of Kanye West’s epic mic grabbing moment during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards or Solange’s 2014 Post-Met Gala elevator fight with Jay-Z, and find inspiration for doing something outlandish to get people talking for a long time. In these parts, consider walking in the footsteps of a Toke Makinwa or Daddy Freeze and you are well on your way to being famous.
Never repeat your clothes:Being a famous face is not a day’s job. It takes careful planning and focus, and one of the ways to show you are serious about this full-time business is to take care of your fashion. Want to be a celebrity? Then, you better not be caught wearing an item of clothing twice. Up your wardrobe game and make a statement with your pieces each time you step out the way celebrities do, and you just might be considered one.
Date a fellow celebrity:Think of the most famous people in the world of music and movies. One thing is common to all of them; at one time or the other, they have dated one of their kind. Quite a number of them have even gone ahead to marry their fellow A-list celebrity. The list is endless– Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, Chris Brown and Rihanna, Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Beyonce and Jay-Z. Over here we have Banky and Adesua, Tuface and Annie, Osas and Gbenro; and really what’s better than one famous person? Two. Twice the star power.
Get divorced:Studies show that the average celebrity marriage lasts 8 years. But that’s even a flattering figure for Hollywood marriages where we have seen marriages last less than 72 hours. Stars like Britney Spears, Eddie Murphy and Kim Kardashian who at different times were married for 56 hours, 2 weeks, and 72 days respectively provide inspiration for the celebrity wannabe who’s looking for role models in that department.
Have your paparazzi moment:What’s a celebrity without the paparazzi? It’s the worst kept secret that the men with the cameras are always looking to catch famous people doing stuff they shouldn’t be doing, or even doing something as mundane as getting a cup of coffee from Starbucks. Sometimes, the paparazzi do not know where to draw the line, and time and again, cameras have been smashed. From Brad Pitt to Britney Spears to Justin Bieber, the running battle between celebrities and the paparazzi is one that’s unlikely to end soon. Want to be a celebrity? Get your own paparazzi moment, it’s a foolproof method of driving your popularity several notches higher.
Say or do something outrageous:By now it should be pretty clear. Your job as an aspiring celebrity is to make the news as often as possible. No one is going to find you interesting or remember you if you are modest or shy away from the cameras. The biggest celebrities have all said something that was out of character at one time or the other. Remember that “uh-oh” moment when actor and former governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger said he thinks a gay marriage should be between a man and a woman? Or that 2005 jumping on the couch moment by Tom Cruise when he was being interviewed by Oprah or even our very own Jim Iyke or Burna Boy getting up to one of their shenanigans. You really should be pulling off something like that. It’s sure to fast track your journey to “celebrityhood”.
Spend lavishly:Expensive vacations, multi-million dollar houses, fast cars and designer apparels. Those are the hallmarks of being a celebrity. Never let it be said that your possessions are cheap or you’re a cheapskate. If you have to be in debt to achieve this, by all means, like Nike, just do it.
Arrive fashionably late always:Celebrities are never the first to arrive for any event, except it involves a higher personality. As a celebrity, always make a grand entrance to any event: this may mean coming in two to four hours after the start time even if you are the host. Your audience will grumble but they will wait, after all, they already paid to see you. When you eventually get there, mumble some half-hearted apology and go on with the business of the day.
A celebrity status can also be enhanced or cemented by coming up with a fashion line, making friends with the political class or showing off charity works to the less privileged. In any case, adopting a couple of the suggestions above will set you on the path to superstardom.

Help Gaddafi’s son out of Libya,https://punocracy.com/help-gaddafis-son-out-of-libya/,2020-08-05T08:52:44+01:00,"Hello there, am sorry to disturb you but I need your help. Pls don’t ignore me. My name is Muhammad Al-Shukarami Al-Amsarawi Al-Moneim El-Gaddafi, the grandson of the late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.
I know you probably hate my grandfather because of how the Americans write about him. I understand but my grandpa is not like that. He is a good man who make a lot of money that America want to take. It is because he did not give them his money that they kill him. That is why I need your help.
My grandfather give me a lot of money to keep when they want to kill him because many people did not know me. I use to wonder why he did not want me in front of camera but I know now. It is because he want to protect me. I have a total of $2,345,569,879 hidden in different accounts that I need to take out of Libya and escape too. I can’t take it until I am out of the country but I need a fake ID. I can’t use the money for now because they’ll know and they’ll find me. That is why I am sending you message after seeing your Facebook and email.
I want you to give me money like $1000 to do my fake ID and leave the country. I know this is like much to you but I will give you $1,500,000 if you help me do this. I just want your $1000 to leave that’s all.
I have to be going now as I come to use a cafe. Please don’t tell anyone my secret or they’ll find you and me. You can send the money to my via direct transfer. I’ll send my account details as picture so that they’ll not suspect. Thank you for helping me."
How to be intelligent on social media | Ololade Ajekigbe,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-intelligent-on-social-media-ololade-ajekigbe/,2020-08-01T10:40:07+01:00,"For many, social media offers a better opportunity to interact compared to the physical world. This is not unrelated to the reality that most people spend a significant chunk of their time online. Friendships, romantic alliances, and businesses are forged through the different platforms. The flip side to this is a growing unhealthy rivalry and pressure to be seen as successful. A trend that has given rise to the jostle for the “intelligence crown”. And so, everyone wants to come across as the most knowledgeable across every subject matter.
The inclination to grandstand and project oneself as a connoisseur of knowledge is an art only a few have perfected. Oh yes, It is indeed an art. Many of those we tag influencers or who have a huge following and charge a sum for endorsing brands have deployed this artistry to attain that status. They are vocal; seem to always have a sensible contribution to the trending discourse and their views are often adopted as a holy grail of sorts.
Wondering how they do it? Well, you’re welcome as I reveal the secret. Here’s what you need to know, and more importantly, do, to come across as cerebral in the competitive and chaotic world of social media:
The idea of sitting out a topic one has little knowledge of should never resonate with you. You see, social media conversations are unlike other types. You’re likely going to be chiming in your viewpoint amid tens of others who may or may not know quite a few things about the hot topic.
For instance, you may find yourself in the midst of a heated argument concerning government’s decision to shut the borders in an attempt to grow patronage for the made in Nigeria rice. You know you are oblivious of this policy; you’re probably only learning of it, but heaven forbid that you keep mute and allow others have the floor. Talk. Talk a lot. Talk some more. And if you get called out on your ignorance, insist you know what you are saying.
Soon enough, you’ll earn the respect and admiration of people like you who are none the wiser but who are not quite as gutsy as you are in displaying their ignorance.
It’s one thing to genuinely see things differently when a controversial matter is being discussed, and another to disagree on the premise of not wanting to be agreeable with others. Those who are desperate to be seen as intelligent have a contrary opinion all the time because they want to be that lone voice in the cacophony of voices. They know they are lying to themselves, but they need to project the image of a non-conformist just so people can acknowledge their willingness to stand alone.
When everyone is decrying the prevalence of child marriage in the north, insist it is a culture that should be respected. When the vast majority are praising a Nigerian who has done the country proud in some competition, declare that their feat is nothing special. With time, you’ll have people who ascribe intelligence to you just for daring to be different.
“He whom the herd has pronounced intelligent is intelligent indeed.” Once you understand this rule of thumb in the virtual community, your job is half-way done. A huge number of those who are touted as bright on the streets of social media are only declared so because they command a large following. This band of followers are quick to shut down any dissenting voice that seeks to expose their leader.
Imagine having that level of clout and power—one where humans like you have no scruples staking their reputation— just to make you look good. Map a strategy to grow a cult-like band of cheerleaders and you’ll always have people who defend you even when your lack of depth is apparent to the rest of us.
Highfalutin ideas and grandiose comments are almost an exclusive preserve of social media these days. They are deployed by those who really have nothing to say but are aware they can bamboozle the undiscerning with embellished remarks. It works all the time and will probably work for a long time to come. Got no clue about what the intellectuals are debating? Repeat what somebody else has said, only this time, throw in a bunch of eclectic grammar, and you’ll have your audience applauding and clinging onto your every word.
The social media cosmos is a unique space where nothing is really as it seems. Understanding this will help you navigate the platform with an insider’s knowledge and the dexterity you require to be known and respected as somebody.
You’re welcome!

"Nigeria: People’s Republic of China, Phase II",https://punocracy.com/nigeria-peoples-republic-of-china-phase-ii/,2020-08-01T10:27:32+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Nigeria, a record-breaking country and pacesetter in all kinds of dealings across Africa, is about to break another record. At this juncture, it’s left to anyone who’s still in doubt about our status as the giant of Africa. Giants set the pace, and that’s what we’re doing. More than producing enough comic relief to Africans, we’re about to do the unthinkable.
We gained independence in 1960 from the British, but we’re about to be recolonized by the Chinese. It’s only a matter of time before we’ll all become Nigeria-born Chinese because of the unquenchable love of our hardworking leaders for Chinese loans. After squandering what benevolence has brought to our domain, they resort to borrowing.
Start making plans for the imminent economy. You don’t want to be in ‘shock’ — like someone we all know — when it happens. We’re all living on borrowed time and land. The landlord can come at any time to chase us out of the land. However, those who auctioned out the country cannot be affected. They’ve created a small boat from the disintegrating ship called Nigeria for their own escape. It was you that refused to vote/sell your vote that will suffer for it.
You should now know that you’re not a citizen of Nigeria, you’re a Nigeria-born Chinese. Your country is not Nigeria. It is the People’s Republic of China, Phase Two. Phase One is in Asia. Phase Two is in Africa. Leave the flag or coat of arms alone,ko matter.You’re about to be colonized for the second time. This time, it’s not by force or violence. It’s a voluntary action.
The leaders whom you voted for with your two eyes open like a halogen lamp and your two legs on top of each other to the polling booth on election day are the ones who have sold you to the Chinese via their love for loans with stringent conditions. I’m sure the N2k and cups of rice you sold your vote for hasn’t finished. Well, the Chinese are almost here. Brace up becausee don happen.
Now that you’ve understood that you’re a Chinese, the next step is to start learning the Chinese language. I recommend Mandarin. You can’t be speaking Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, or English to Lee Ming Hoo, Cho Zing, or Gu Jun Yii in the new country. Don’t take this lightly. They’re about to borrow Nigeria off the map of Africa. Even the Chinese are surprised,e no concern them. We’re the giant of Africa in borrowing. On top of borrowing from them, our leaders still import Chinese manpower to get the job — they borrowed for — done in Nigeria. Our education is too full of dignity and this administration has provided excess employment that it’s needful to concede those meager jobs to the Chinese.
It’s inhumane to speak against this borrowing habit. All of us can see the great effect it has had/been having on our populace. Also, there’s nothing bad in this habit seeing how prudent we’ve been with spending in this administration. More Nigerians have been lifted out of poverty, except that it’s mostly from poverty to the grave. Nigerians have never been so secure like now so much that they sleep with one eye open. After all, all borrowings are on behalf of the federal government.Chai.Our future generations will be so busy with paying the debtehn.
Unfortunately, we still have three bus stops to go before we alight from this next level bus. I hope that when we reach the final bus stop in 2023, we’ll still have a country to call our own. Start looking up for Chinese names. You’ll need a new name when the landlord comes like a thief at night. You brought this upon yourself. You can call me Li Chu Cheng."
How to kill a business in Nigeria: Advisory opinion for the government,https://punocracy.com/how-to-kill-business-nigeria-advisory-opinion/,2020-07-29T13:19:09+01:00,"As a national government acting through your agencies and sector regulators, there’s nothing more delightful to you than watching your lazy citizens hustle hard to build their businesses, make your economy attractive to potential investors and then when their respective sectors start to boom, BOOM! you hit them with sucker-punches in the form of odious regulations and enforcement. This is your elixir, it is what keeps you going and helps you retain your sanity even in the face of Corona, Boko Haram, Southern Kaduna and the economic woes facing your country.
Now, the first thing you need to do to make these businesses more creative and, by extension, add value to your economy, is to saddle them with a handicap; the most feasible of which is epileptic power supply. This is designed such that every company that wants to survive your business environment needs to use itsnumber 6and invest wisely in its first employee… The generator.
Given your insightful knowledge that the generator can make or mar the success of a business, you play the Yoruba game of“eyi je, eyi o je” with the pump price of petrol effectively throwing into disarray their business forecasts right from the word go.
However, you will not stop here. For those of them stubborn enough to want to manage the epileptic power you supply them, just hit them with impossible-to-justify electricity consumption bills. Never mind the fact that your power holding company has not even supplied them with power for the last three months, just slap them with it and let yourbukatabecome theirbukata.
The next thing you would want to do is to leave the business sectors unregulated. Not to worry, this is intentional and not an oversight, you’re still bringing backthe bird in your pocket. When the sector starts to boom, slap them withodoriferouspolicies and regulations, impose unreasonable taxes, and requirements for permits before they can operate in the business sector. It is of no concern to you that they built the sector from the ground up,gbogbo iyenis just sentiments. Yousefmust chop from their investor money.
In sectors where you’re both regulator and competitor, the above still applies, but only when they start outshining you and spoiling your market by fulfilling orders in 2 days rather than your customary 6 months. In these instances, the entry conditions you impose will be to cripple their businesspatapata. All, they say, is fair in love and war. You need toregulatorilystrangle them to remind them that they need to respect their elders and give honour to whom honour is due.
In fact, if they start to do like they haveskoin skoinin their head, monopolise the sectors and gift the rights to play in them to your largest campaign donors. After all,na all of una be the government.
Pay lip service to your gospel of ease of doing business, double tax your businesses, forbid synergy among your agencies, let them wash their linen and call each other out on Twitter. Practise misdirection and political masturbation so that no one would remember to ask you how you embezzled the revenue generated from these sectors.
Finally, let them know of your tough love for them. After all, without your tough love, none of them would have the gumption, experience and social capital to organise masterclasses and speak at events to tell their grass to grace stories. You are the beginning and you are the end; without you, they are nothing.
Do this as often as you please and all will be well with your government.
Shalom."
Who is a Nigerian police officer?,https://punocracy.com/who-is-a-nigerian-police-officer/,2020-07-29T08:43:43+01:00,"Those who are quick-witted will perhaps have a common answer to this question. A Nigerian police officer is someone whose job is to safeguard the lives and properties of the citizens. That, I believe, is the job of every security-conscious citizen too.
In the past months when robbery attacks were incessant in Kutuwenje, it was Baba Kamoru that mobilised men in the neighbourhood to repel these attacks, while Constable Taiwo was patiently waiting at the police station to report cries of how much money and other valuables were stolen.
A Nigerian police officer is a responsible person, dutiful, and full of integrity but then they are hard to find. To this effect, I have compiled a mini list that helps identify a Nigerian officer. Here you go!
A Nigerian police officer asks sexist questions:You don’t have to be surprised. A Nigerian police officer will leave out relevant questions to ask irrelevant questions during interrogations especially when you are a lady unfortunately caught in a crime scene. Interrogations that will determine whether or not you are an accomplice will be forsaken for questions like: Who deflowered you? Did you or did you not have casual sex? Are you in a relationship or not? Before you argue otherwise, think Wyclef.
He boosts national economy:I honestly do not know why this great job of a Nigerian police officer is under-reported in this country. When a Nigerian police officer transacts business with temporary Samaritans atcheque pointsandbursary stops, the money generated therein is deposited in the nation’s sole account and used to finance budget.
He is our friend: For the friends of law defaulters who have visited Nigerian police stations frequently, you’ll always see an inscription that reads:Police is your friend. This is very true, so we must in turn take them as our personal persons by giving gifts to appreciate their hard work whether or not we commit an offence.
He is a party loyalist:For the stubborn citizens who have been tear-gassed at one occasion or the other by Nigerian police officers while demonstrating that so and so person must go, you are the architect of your own misfortune. When you are shouting, disturbing the peace of the neighbourhood with your solidarity chants, you don’t know you draw the ire of party members the police officers work for,ehn? Don’t you know, like someone said, that the Nigerian police is a commodity bought and sold by politicians?
He multitasks:A Nigerian police officer’s job does not stop at policing alone. He is a custom officer, he checks whether or not you carry contraband;  he is a Vehicle Inspection Officer, he checks whether or not your vehicle is in good condition; he is a prayer warrior, he prays for you when you slap his hand with Euro or Dollar (because Naira has become devalued). A Nigerian police officer, in fact, also rescues soldiers in distress.
Peace

How to make policies in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-make-policies-in-nigeria/,2020-07-29T08:29:19+01:00,"By: Waliu Adeyeri
Are you a Policy Maker or a Minister? Or are you preparing to be one? There is something important you need to know. I call it the “Test and Error Policy-Making Theory.”
You need to know that the policy you make for the masses is like a scientific innovation, you have to test run it like a mechanical engineer does to a just-repaired car.
Don’t forget you must test it to stir the general public, though their reactions have no effect on you. Your purpose is to join in the theatrics happening in the country, your office should not be left out in the show of such humorous Democrazy.
This is how you do it!
Start the process with your fellow policy makers in the ministry. You have to be crafty and be proactive to stand your opinion here, the meeting is where you prove your expertise in decision-making for the masses. Remember, what Elnathan John taught about lateness to meeting, don’t forget that; it’s a necessity.
At the meeting you prepare quite a number of plans that fall in the categories of demo-policy and policy. You can name the plans after the alphabets of the English language. “Plan A, B, C…”
At the end of the meeting, publish the outcome. I mean the demo-policy, the reporters are waiting to serve the public your new product with mesmerising favourable or unfavourable headlines depending on the name of the media house. As expected, the people will react to your demo-policy.
Now that your demo-plan is eliciting reactions as expected. Just take your time; 24 hours or more. The rejoinder; the skits, music or satirical commentary would be released shortly.
When released, then you have made a name, you have contributed to the entertainment of the masses by waking them to a topic to talk about, dance or to make out a slang. Do ensure that the public announcement is made in your name by another officer.
After the satisfactory result, you can now release the real policy. The masses would be glad their whispers yielded a positive change from your office and you have listening ears. In short, you have the love of the people at heart. This time, you should be the one to make the official announcement.
Don’t forget change is inevitable, you have to be an agent of change, it doesn’t matter if it’s negative; change is change no matter the form it takes. I wish you the best in the discharge of your policy making duty as a senior officer in your ministry or public office.
Accept my best wishes!

5 reasons present-day Nigerian youth are the best,https://punocracy.com/5-reasons-nigerian-youth-the-best/,2020-07-27T07:59:24+01:00,"As a member of the National Association of Present Day Nigerian Youth (NAPNY), I have come to give you five good reasons we are the best. You see, it takes only abeltlesslegend like myself to see the beauty of this great generation and why we are better than our forefathers. Listen attentively  as I won’t repeat myself, and, as you all know, what a beltless legend sees while sitting, an old man cannot see it while standing even if he is using a telescope.
In this lifeehn, we cannot die young. We take things one step at a time. See those old people that tell us to plan, who theyepp?Upon all the plan, what have they achieved? As an elder statesman among the youth, I can categorically tell you that plans are useless and goals are baseless. The only goal that makes sense is to get rich quick.
If I ask one of my guys studying Agricultural Engineering what he wants to become in future, he will tell you, “an Agricultural Engineer”.  Very smart, right? Don’t bother to compliment him. My guys are great like that.
Ask him where he wants to work, and he will tell you “anywhere”. My guy is intelligent and multi-talented. He can work in a bank, a supermarket, or even a morgue as long as it pays well. Is it not to make money?
Can you now see that plans are useless?If Chidima see money, plan go scatter.
What’s that thing they say about unitysef? I think, “United we start, divided we fail.”
My fellow youth have a bond that is so great that everything is done in unity. When the ladies learnt make-up, they learnt it together. When we began mini importation, we began together. When we started investing in Forsage and Lion’s Share, we all started at the same time.
To prove to you that this unity is not new, few years ago, we all invested in MMM together, and when MMM ran away with our investment, we all cried and drank garri together. Can you now see that we are smarter than Dangote, Otedola, and Mike Adenuga combined? After all, unlike us, they are not united. Maybe they would have been wealthier.
Patience is the only reason some of our grandfathers died without beards. Why will I suffer from theemoji syndrome(beardlessness) when there are special beard oils in the market to accelerate the process. I refuse to be a fool. As an elder statesman, I am telling you now that if that business you invested $500 in is not bringing back up to $120,000 dollars in a month, it’s not worth it. A whole Nigerian youth and you cannot give your girlfriend a Bugatti on her birthday! It is patience that will still kill you. If we cannot make the money, we steal it.
Sorry, what do you call a guy with 300 followers on Twitter? He is a leader! Add small Twitter savagery and he becomes the go-to guy for useless criticism of politicians. The leadership skills of Nigerian youth is so great that people willingly follow us.Oyamake us class representatives and you will love our administration. We will spoil our class mates with extra charges for the purchase of course materials and give incentives of unnecessary stress. Yesnow, as leaders, we have to feel important, earn some cool cash, and “take care of ourselves” like our mentors at the NDDC.
Whether it is to snatch ballot boxes or spell coconut, we don’t refuse to answer when the elders call, especially when they shake our hands with a handful of freshly minted 1000 naira notes. We are not doing it for the money o. We are simply snatching ballot boxes and protesting because it is unfair to cheat such a kind and pleasant politician.
With just five reasons, I have shown you what the elders have been trying to hide from us by calling us lazy. We are great and our goal is a great one. You see those haters called elders, they are trying to copy us butKhaki no be leather.So when you hear that Nigerian youth are bad, just know that it was said by a hater, and start trending a Twitter hashtag."
The fall of the Nigerian comedy industry,https://punocracy.com/the-fall-of-the-nigerian-comedy-industry/,2020-07-23T09:00:37+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Professional comedians should start watching their backs. I pray that the extinction of that industry isn’t imminent. A new class of comedians is emerging with great comic capacity more than anything we’ve ever seen. They don’t require anything to launch their profession other than a public office or an opportunity to serve the people. The only due they pay to remain in the industry is required every four years.
They are about to sweep off the conventional comedy industry on account of the mushrooming audience ready to laugh away their tomorrow. These unusual breeds of comedians have a common name; they’re called politicians, sometimes, public servants. In Nigeria, that word isn’t what it is in the dictionary. It’s got a whole new meaning entirely.
Nigerians love to be entertained, that’s why those who are supposed to ‘repair the polity’ (oselu) have ended up ‘eating up the polity’ (ojelu). They have switched from providing good governance to providing comic reliefs for the populace, while they take the nation from glory to glory in shame and poverty. The number ofdramatis personnaein Nollywood is a tiny fraction of those in Nigeria’s political space.
Any Nigerian who is depressed should be arrested. How will you be depressed with the surplus comedians we have directing the affairs of the nation. Justice, Peace,Comedy, and Progress should be the new motto on our coat of arms. Nollywood is losing it, just look at Nigeria. We’ve produced enough comedians in our politics that it’ll soon become a source of foreign exchange.
The latest comedian on the bloc is the acting NDDC MD, a direct descendant of Olisa Metuh, and of the order of Dino Melaye and co.Conscience fear the guy sotey, he had to faint at the mention of the billions and trillions that he and his cohortsmister-managed. Those funds are more than ‘mismanaged’. It’s on a higher plane. It’s disrespectful to call it ‘mis-‘. He was shocked at the figure like Mr. ‘Shocki’ at Aso Rock. I’m sure he didn’t count the number of zeros as he was channeling the money meant for his kinsmen for his personal use.
Nigeria is comic relief, and her citizens like it that way. Many African nations are gradually waking up to clean their mess, but we’re okay with the entertainment those we selected and elected into sensitive offices in the land are providing for us. The change will come when we’re ready. For now,na entertainment galore.
Abi, are you not entertained?!"
Nollywood should partner with housemates in the hollowed chamber,https://punocracy.com/nollywood-partner-housemates-hollowed-chamber/,2020-07-23T08:49:55+01:00,"By: Winlade
Someone asked what the color of our problem is in this part of the world. I didn’t answer because there was no need to name the color of our problem. Our National Team wears it to the African Cup of Nations and World Cup and we support them with pride.
Well, if there is any need to name the color for the
sake of current affairs, two colors would feature; green and white because we
have many green snakes abiding under grass while our saints are clad in
immaculate garment designed with a stain of blood or stolen money.
Most times, a saint may have the combination of these two colors. He would use green to camouflage and look like the friend of the masses and steal money meant to save souls from poverty, poor education and untimely death insecurity could bring. Untimely death used to be the weapon of village witches and wizard to eliminate promising souls from the surface of the earth. We have even rained fire and brimstone over them many times in different religious places. It seems what we now have in addition to that is human curse. The curse placed on us by fate for befriending saints who are builders of hell. How they got themselves trained in such craft is still a mystery.
Prior to the time they found a seat in the corridor of power, they understood everything about governance and meeting the needs of people. In fact, they considered the usual fight in the House over who gets what share of the National Cake as demeaning to the entire nation. Therefore, they sold an anti-corruption story to us. We bought it with our sweat. Some did with their blood. But we have not received our change. They said we will receive it. Its fruits will come like a thief in the night. Pending the time, let us enjoy the rice in Kano and the 24h/7 electricity we read about in the news.
Some days ago, I followed with keen attention an interesting reality TV show. What I discovered amused me. I have heard of several shows like boxing in the Hallowed Chamber and exchange of profane utterances. I remember one drama I watched some years ago. A housemate had threatened to impregnate another housemate who happened to be the wife of a national leader. Many thought the housemate by name Diliar didn’t get his calculation right since the wife of the national leader had entered menopause. However, he insisted that his virility had no regard for the laws of nature.
This recent time around, the show held in the Hallowed Chamber with housemates exploring their creative ingenuity to ensure that words do not fall on dry ground. My father used to say, “Words are like egg. If it falls on dry ground, it spills its yoke and loses its secrecy.” The Housemates had decided to sit on a matter that Twitter court could not handle. A discovery was made that the money disbursed to develop the region of Black Gold disappeared into thin air like ghost. When Honorable Apakagod said, “This money is distributed into the account of many of the people around here,” Mr. Chairman quickly hit his gavel to restore order. Apakagod’s mouth was running too much and it could cause a national havoc. The situation was well managed. Courtesy of Mr. Chairman.
The Invited Guest for the day was Emeritus-In-Acting. He came prepared. He knew what was expected of him and played well his part. The world was watching and it was going to be unfair on his part to disappoint his director and the person who wrote the script he was set to act. What was he supposed to do? Come forward, answer questions he would be asked and collapse in the middle of the session if the questions pose risks of him being infected with covid-19.
The fear of covid-19 alone was enough to trigger his
action and the reactions that followed.
“How much did you say you spent on covid-19 relief
fund?” Mr. Chairman asked.
“3.5 billion naira,” he responded.
“3.5 billion naira or 5 billion naira?” Mr. Chairman interjected.
“What you are saying is conflicting with what we have here,” he added to seek
clarification.
In an attempt to give clarification, Emeritus-In-Acting remembered the popular song, “This world is not my own,” when his eyes started turning. In a twinkle of an eye, he lost control of himself and the housemates rushed to give him a first aid treatment. They all attended standard schools that did not only expose them to quality academic learning but also the value of selflessness. This was made evident when Mr. Speaker forgot about the existence of covid-19 and social distancing regulation to grab the jaw of Emeritus-In-Acting and started opening it to check the color of his tongue. I guess he wanted to check if it was green, white, or a different color of lie and deceit. He forgot he needed Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). He probably wanted to show an example of how to be selfless to doctors who are always in the news complaining about their vulnerability to covid-19 because of shortage of PPE.
As a result of this emergency, Mr. Chairman declared the show inconclusive and rescheduled it to later date. Meanwhile, it was a great show with quality comedy that draws tears from the eyes of overthinkers. Overthinkers always think comedy shows are not expected from housemates in the Hallowed Chamber. As for me, I have decided to enjoy every bit of my life because You Only Live Once (YOLO). If their deliberation cannot afford me a better experience during sport activity with my partner in the middle of the night, I will enjoy the standard of the comedy it has to offer me and laugh away my pessimism.
I give them credit for being consistent in producing a comedy show higher in standard when compared to the one the duo of Kunle Afolayan and Kemi Adetiba could have produced. I think they should consider these housemates, Emeritus-In-Acting in particular, for a script I will volunteer to write on how to evade haunting questions during a pandemic relief fund probe. I will personally request the inclusion of legends like Diliar, Mentu, Fadele and other outstanding comedians of our country to make the acting superb. These legends have really sold the image of our country to the nooks and crannies of the world, even Nollywood is struggling to reach.
After watching our housemates and how good they acted during the show, I was glad to be part of this country where laughter cures every serious matter. With this kind of Housemates in charge of ourHollowed Chamber, I am convinced that Africa and the world can never be sad because ours is a country of clowns without costumes.

Becoming a politician in Nigeria: A starter pack,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-politician-in-nigeria/,2020-07-23T08:32:10+01:00,"By: Victor Adegbite
Are you a political appointee or an aspiring politician looking forward to occupy a public office in Nigeria? Good you are here. I want to assist you with the necessary skills needed for success and prosperity in your intended profession, regardless of how much funds you swallow.
You need to establish yourself in the knowledge of this starter pack. The principal skill you must possess isdrama. As a budding Nigeria politician, you must be zealous in theatrics, melodrama, comedy, and the art of singing and dancing.
First, you must learn to shed tears in your aspiration to be voted into power; buy underprivileged citizens’ sympathy through live telecast. You should learn to have photo ops of you having a great meal of garri, sachet Milo or pap.
Your big vehicles are hindrances, when you want meet with the electorate, as per the road is too smooth, hence, ride ‘okada’. It’s popular among the majority who live in an underdeveloped society, swimming in poverty, misery and want, to better associate with them.
You should also learn to jump on every social issue on social media. Be involved in trendy slogans such asoin,you’re doing well,don’t leave meand so on. You can choose to do giveaways also.
After getting into power, you necessarily don’t need to retain the favor of the people or affirm your campaign promises. In solidarity with the people’s plight, you can threaten to embark on strike actions, even as a sitting governor to show empathy for the striking workers, who are too passionate about payment for their jobs. As part of the stomach infrastructure of feeding the people, you should join them at local cafeterias, bukas, eat at school feeding programs and munch roasted corn in public. Who cares about table manners,no be for Naija?
Of course, since corruption is just common stealing in Nigeria like our past president said, you can always indulge in it. Embezzle public funds, defy sworn oath; in point of fact, sexual harassment isn’t a bad idea. You can always create a hobby around harassing women. You’ll surely get away with it. Ask the people of Kogi state for validation.
To renew your mandate, cross-carpeting is a great choice. Your party can betray you. They can give your mandate to someone else. They don’t want your prosperity and success; they are selfish and they won’t encourage your dream. So, cross-carpeting it is.
Getting caught or prosecuted for
embezzlement isn’t common in Nigeria. Just avoid stepping on the toes of
godfathers. If caught, you can always count yourself lucky to threaten
“hunger strike” during drilling by refusing the official food offered
to you and eating only at night. You must necessarily be a good dribbler,
employ diversionary tactics at avoiding sacrosanct questions as regards your
office and past crimes.
Lastly, an important art to save yourself from trouble as a politician is fainting. If the questions by the committee aren’t favorable or the judgement is passed against you, practice the art of seizure and watch everyone show you love.
With all these skills, you are on your way to having a successful political career.

All you need to face a panel as a senior public servant in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/facing-panel-as-senior-public-servant-nigeria/,2020-07-22T07:17:56+01:00,"A satirical commentary on Pondei’s fainting saga by Waliu Adeyeri
Are you a public servant preparing to face a committee or panel over the (mis)management of public funds? Remember the saying, “Poor Preparation Precedes Poor Performance.”
You really need to know that facing a panel can be embarrassing and frustrating. Hence, a holistic preparation is a necessity most especially when you are trying to sweep things under the carpet. This is because reporters and rumour-carriers are on the lookout for your poor presentation which might eventually unveil your ass to the world. Follow me on this short trip as I show you how it’s been done here in this place called Nigeria.
The first stage is the ‘no-traces stage’; at this stage all you need is delete every exhibit such as the account statement and the dummy-funds embezzled by watching them burn along with the apartment. The account statement is made of a highly inflammable paper that would get burnt at the sight of a well planned power fluctuation.
Take precaution for your life only, the account statement and balance sheet can burn to ashes; “when there is life there is hope”. You still have to present the proposal for the reparation of your apartment and curing the injury you sustained, your death would be a loss to the apartment and your pocket. God help you as you nurture the slight wound on your skin.
When this is done, you should not stop there, else you would be suspected. Nigerian reporters, bloggers and video skit producers are great at doing the work of the financial crime investigators. Before you know it, you would be faced with talks and skits unveiling your mess.
The next is facing the panel. You may try to circumvent them by claiming you are in the hospital nurturing the wound you sustained from the fire outbreak. Don’t worry. This is Nigeria, the panel sitting would be rescheduled for your sake.
While you await the date, you have got enough rubies in your confinement. All you need is convert them to visible contract and give them out to the members of the panel. This would help in either concealing the mess or to ease the questioning. My prayer is that the former is your case because Nigerians forget such issues easily.
If the latter is your case, don’t be so rest assured, you didn’t give everyone in the committee the contract. It could be an ‘oversight’ or ‘underestimation’. Be ready for the eventuality!
When the eventuality comes, and aggrieved members of the committee begin to rain questions on you like the showers of blessings you prayed for in your religious house, two things should come to your mind. You can’t afford to soil your name in the mud and if that would happen not only you should be dragged, let others who enjoyed from the cake join you.
What do you do?
Start by pointing fingers at the beneficiaries of the cake among the members of the committee. Leave the rest for them to sort, they would find a way of ending the questioning. With this you are gradually winning for they would sheathe their swords gradually.
Oftentimes, the voice of the aggrieved members might continue to surface like a gourd pressed underneath water. All you need here is the smack down formulae. The questions must be choking you and making you feel dizzy. Give yourself the smack down by “appearing to be fainting”. The reason for your fainting would be justified, don’t worry. That would be the end of the sitting.
By now you have faced the panel, Nigerians will believe you and laugh out their pains while they watch and re-watch your clip, reproduced as skits, in the next few weeks. After that trust me your case will not be revisited. Being a SIN-IOR Public Servant is not a day task. The arts of mismanagement of public funds and concealing your ass in public media are important tools that should never be neglected in your toolkit.

‘In addendum to my public theatrical display’,https://punocracy.com/in-addendum-to-my-public-theatrical-display/,2020-07-22T06:59:43+01:00,"By: Ibrahim Williams
I have finally been revived by the amazing intervention of two Pepsi bottles passed into my body through drip at the Maitama Hospital. And I know it is high time I came forth to comment on all that happened before the investigative committee on the 20th of this month.
Sincerely, the issue at hand — for those of you who don’t know — was not a premeditated television juice put together by myself as well as other concerned personnel to give you all — our beloved countrymen and women — something to cackle, gaggle, and babble about during this pandemic. Nonetheless, I am gladdened with the way you all reacted to this issue, knowing full well that I am not the first person to play this role play in the history of role-playing in Nigeria.
My gladness is especially heightened by the fact that you guys swiftly took to your Twitter handles to pull my name to grace and glory. It is the first time I ever made it to the top ten trends on Twitter NG, a dream I’ve nursed since I was 5. More still, I am happy to have been honored as a cinematographic crooner of a new slumping style. This style, countrymen, was inspired by a leaf that fell from my favorite tree a day before my visitation to the committee.
Now, away from the niceties, I caught wind of
some bad belle people who have refused to see me in the right light with
regards to the issue on ground. And to them, I direct these paragraphs.
Seeehn, the truth of the matter is that you guys do not appreciate the truth — even when she strips herself naked before your eyes. Compared to theHorscaaward-winning actors we have, I mean the likes of Mr. Peter De Rock, the one, the solidagbalumo,the roadside ex-governor of Ebiti; Mr. SDM, our popularGlammyaward-winning multi-talented ex-senator; Mr. O-lisa May-two, chief thrift collector of theFiDiFi;Rash-id Main-a, the noble rosary-pulling ex-chairman of the Pension Reform team; and other distinguished Actors of the Federation (AOF) — whom do I equal?
Another thing is that
if you watched clearly enough, you would have seen from the interrogation style
that those men who claim to be patriotic ‘pathfinders’ were nothing more than
witches fromIdemiliwho vowed to my great grandmother that
one day soon they shall pour sand inside my garri and force-feed me before the
eyes of the world. But God no go shame us!
What happened before the committee was a blatant abuse of power against my humble self. If not, why make a big deal out of something little? Why bring a machine gun to settle a civil matter? Over a chicken feed of 641 million, and 536 million naira, only! These monies, for those care to know, were evenwell appropriatedandwell disbursed. Only that we lost the receipt of expenditure when rain fell on the farm that was beside the barn in front of the yard behind the road.
Again, you would notice I corrected the questioner over an alleged mismanagement of 1.5 billion naira. Just to reiterate, it is only 1.32 billion naira. And this was set aside to cater for the wear and tear of my team. After all, we deserve to be paid handsomely for doing nothing, at least that’s what the NDDC has been about since its creation — getting paid to do nothing. Should the status quo then change during my reign?
To my great and
fantastic fans out there, it will interest you to know that I am fine now. No
shaking at all. And for those who requested I leave a note of recommendation
when I address the nation. Here’s my little piece of advice:
If you intend to recreate this scene in a similar big stage, please don’t use Pepsi, I have used it. Don’t say, “I’ll need to check and get back to you”. I have said that too. Rather, study the works of previous celebrated Actors of the Federation (AOF), and add new things as I did. This is because Nigerians love new things and they forget them easily.
I wish you all the good luck you wish me as we proceed to the next phase of this briefcase."
Big Brother Naija: A timely palliative for restless Nigerian youth,https://punocracy.com/big-brother-naija-timely-palliative-youth/,2020-07-22T06:43:02+01:00,"By: Ogunrinu Olanshile
The scene is the presidential palace. It’s obvious that an important meeting is about to take place in the large conference room. The atmosphere is tense despite the cool breeze emanating from the giant air conditioners. The President, His excellency, is present, so are the Vice President and other important members of the administration. It is time for the monthly assessment of security reports and, as usual, Alhaji Mongunoo, the National Security Adviser (NSA), is presenting the aggregated reports of the agencies.
NSA:(Adjusting his eyeglasses and flowing babariga) Mr President, sir, the youth are getting more conscious politically; they are clamouring for a lot of things. The Revolution Now movement, despite how we punished and are still punishing its convener, has remained unbroken and are planning to hit the streets again to protest. They are becoming increasingly more popular among the youth. Arewa Lives Matter too are planning a huge protest against banditry and killings in their zone. Borno youth are starting to ask strong questions over the long run of terrorism in their states. Some celebrities are also taking part by clamouring. Even artistes like Tiwa Savagee who is only concerned with “stew and sugar cane” is now leading some kind of e-protest with the hashtag #WeAreTired.
Mr President:Uhm.
NSA:Mr President sir, it is because of this that we believe that distracting them will be the best option to douse the tensed atmosphere of the nation. You know Nigerian youth, sir, when you called them lazy, you were right and only being factual sir; they will forget their clamours and agitations as soon as there is something to entertain them. They will forget their pitiable conditions and get so absorbed in the ecstasy of their temporary eldorado. That is our submission Mr President. (Takes a seat while bowing.)
Mr President:Thank you Alhaji, that was a brilliant analysis. (Turning to other participants) So, what do you think can be done to distract the youth from their newly discovered activism?
VP Osibanjoo:Mr President, I think sponsoring a virtual 100 days of praising the Lord by a popular daddy G.O. and popular gospel artistes will do it. You know our youth love the Lord so much and can be radical for Jesus. They will soon leave their fight to God and start tweeting about the countdown to the 100 days.
NSA:Mr Vice President, that is a good idea but it will only interest the Christian section of the populace and we need to implement something that cuts across religion or tribe to capture their interests. Who else has any other idea?
Garuba Sheuu:Sirs, why don’t we spread the news that Magu fed N100 billion to snakes? That will capture their interest, they will start talking about how to “solve the matter”. I trust they will even make comedy skits and music on the issue.
NSA:(Obviously pissed) Mr Garbage…Sorry, Garuba! Why must you reason like garbage? That’s a foolish faux pas to commit. Who has a sensible idea that is workable, please?
Laureta Onochiee:(Curtsying while standing) Sirs,  I think creating a Federal Ministry of Happiness will be a good idea and I can help in heading it.
NSA:Haba! Laureta! Have you been sipping your palm wine again? Who even invited you to this meeting? Go out abeg!
Mr President:So, there is no one with a realistic way to water down the restlessness of our youth’s activism?
(Femii Adesinaa raising his hand quietly)
Mr President:Yes, Femi?
Femii Adesinaa:Sir, I know this programme that will capture their interest, they will be so absorbed in it that they will give no fuck … (bowing immediately). Sorry sirs, for the F-word, but they will be so absorbed in it that they won’t care about how much we add to the price of petrol. It won’t matter to them how many billions are being siphoned at NDDC. They will not even care anymore about their cries for justice for SARS victims. They will be so torn between being Titans or Team Lambo that it will not matter to them if their resumption to school is shifted to 2021. But sir, some of our conservative elders have kicked against this programme because it’s slightly raunchy.
Mr President:Speak up Femii, what programme are you talking about?
Femii Adesinaa:It is the one and only Big Brother Naija, sir.
NSA:Mr President, Femii is right and I believe this is the best way to arrest the situation.
Mr President:(Speaking to his aide) Contact the organisers of the programme, ask them what’s stopping the show, ask them to add 90 more days to the time housemates are to spend, suspend requirements for social distancing! Ask them to pack in the housemates as soon as possible. If they need food, give them 90 bags of imported rice.
Femii Adesinaa:(With a visible smirk) Now, we can sit and watch the lazy youth tweet about how enormous Diana’s boobs are, how razz Lateef is, and they will hurl insults at each other over the eviction of their favourite housemates, borrow money to buy airtime to vote every week, and go about erecting billboards and soliciting votes for their preferred participants. Let’s watch them clash online and block each other while we do our thing.
NSA:Alooter continua, Comrades!

Why J.K. Rowling couldn’t have written ‘Nigeria’,https://punocracy.com/why-rowling-couldnt-have-written-nigeria/,2020-07-22T06:19:18+01:00,"​In the wake of new chart-topping episodes of the multi-award winning TV series, Nigeria, many pundits have suggested that J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter magical fantasy series, is a ghost writer on theNigeriaseries.
In the past, there have been rumours that the award-winning Game of Thrones writer, George R.R. Martin was contributing to theNigeriaseries. Earlier this year, this finger was pointed at notable Nigerian writers like Elnathan John, Lesley Nneka Arima, and the author of the fantasy book,Children of Blood and Bone, Tomi Adeyemi. But none of these writers have claimed to be contributors in part or in whole to theNigeriaseries.
Despite running for 60 years, the series has gone uncredited. Nobody has claimed to be the writer, producer, or director of the show. Actors just spring up every now and then, receive their scripts, play their roles, and move on.
One of Nigeria’s notable actors, Dino Melaye, recently disclosed that his script was delivered to him in his dream, while in detention. He acted his part without blemish and won several awards for it. Ayodele Fayose, another notable actor, said he was cast for the role in his dreams too.
The great cinematography, direction, acting, and overall execution has led to many people looking to meet the writers and producers of the series. But as of today, our analysts can confirm that Rowling truly isn’t an author.Here are top 3 reasons she couldn’t have been a contributor:
The Harry Potter series focuses on a boy and his friends navigating through midlife crises, and overcoming supposedly insurmountable odds, as students in a magic school, while evading a central villain. The power of the series is premised on the potential of the young Harry Potter, and the support he gets from his magical friends. Rowling rows the boat of magical fantasy so well that almost all of Rowling’s works are in that genre.
However,Nigeriais written under the Absurdity genre, and the Things-likely-to-never-happen theme. In the latest episode of the series, we watch as an actor passes out during performance, and comes back to life as soon as someone opens his mouth and attempts to kiss him. This isn’t something you’ll see in a Rowling work. Rowling would have had a female character wake the actor up; either with a kiss, or magical wand.
Rowling takes time to develop characters. Even the villains in the Harry Potter series are well developed. This gives them a longevity that makes them unforgettable in the minds of fans.
In Nigeria, the characters do not have development, and only feature on and off. Although there is a poll of over 150,000,000 possible actors, only about 1% of the talents are selected to feature in the series. Despite running for 60 years, many of these characters are recurring and do not have a strong character arch. They just happen, again and again. Sometimes the viewers forget who the characters are and they get introduced with new features. And the show goes on.
This isn’t something Rowling would have overlooked.
Rowling’s works are tied to magic, and straying out of the path will lead to doom for the series.
But inNigeria, under the Absurdity genre, you are allowed to do anything. You can jump off a moving truck, send soldiers to die and take their money, be a bad boss and blame everyone for your failure, fight the same type of terrorism for a decade, steal money and get extradited for an important role in another country, or just plainly, be absurd.
Rowling’s creativity when compared to theNigeriaseries, is very limited. Rowling definitely couldn’t have been a contributor. She just doesn’t have the creativity, depth, experience, exposure and know-how to handle the project."
NDDC MD’s acting coach resigns after his ‘disappointing performance’,https://punocracy.com/nddc-chairman-acting-coach-resigns/,2020-07-21T07:31:50+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Apparently frustrated, the drama coach of Professor Kemebradichemo Dan Pondeck, boss of the Niger Delta Directorate of Corruption (NDDC), has resigned following his “disappointing performance” yesterday at the House of Representatives.
Professor Pondeck had “passed out” (with some difficulty) on Monday while he was being questioned by the federal lawmakers on how his directorate mismanaged N81.5 billion in 2020 alone.
His trainer, who identified himself simply as Director Rukevwe, said he has never had a more terrible teaching experience and he is, in fact, considering getting treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
“The entire national assembly probe is a script we’ve written since last year and this fainting episode is meant to be the season finale,” he said. “But see what happened? My whole reputation is on the line. My career is in shambles.”
He explained that the plan was hatched by the Ministry of Information to rebrand the Muhammadu Buhari administration “so the anti-corruption war appears to move beyond audio to audiovisual”.
“It is the same thing with the EFCC boss probe,” he whispered over the phone. “Why do you think both of them are acting chairman and MD? You think it’s a coincidence? My brother, their job description all this while has been just to act — and Magu is doing well so far.”
Director Rukevwe described Professor Pondeck as his worst student since he started teaching what he calls “Political Theatrics” seven years ago. He said his record, which was sterling, has now been stained for life.
“I directedSifia Painsin 2018 and trained the leading actor, Ogun-Idile Fayose. You will agree with me it was an Oscar award material with outstanding success. Some of my other students include Rashidi Meina, Olisa Metoo, and Didino Meliar, who has since excelled as a world-class entertainer.”
“But Pondeck,” he continued. “He is an absolute failure. The plan was for him to pass out without movement after feigning epileptic fits in the green chambers. He was supposed to have thrown in two or three coughs too so COVID-19 can be suspected. That would have delayed the probe by at least 14 days, you know.”
In September 2019, former lawmaker, Meliar, explained that his notable performance during a criminal trial where he “was unable to stand” was due to a concept known ascourtophobia.
“You all joke with everything in this country. I seriously couldn’t stand. It happens whenever I’m in a court room. I have courtophobia. Google it!” hetweeted.
We at The T.A. Report are on the edge of our seat to see what the NDDC professorial boss comes up with. House-of-reps-o-phobia is certainly a mouthful, and maybe way too specific. Probophobia, perhaps?

"‘Daddy Magu, we are sorry!’",https://punocracy.com/daddy-magu-we-are-sorry/,2020-07-20T08:26:51+01:00,"By: Ganiu Oloruntade
Our unrivaled hero,
I made it a point of duty
to tender this unreserved apology on behalf of 200 million Nigerians. Don’t be
puzzled, I merely took a cue from the architects of the Fourth Republic: the
power-drunk men in khaki who authored our fraudulent constitution and used the
phrase ‘we the people’ in the introduction, though not even a tinge of
consultation with ‘the people’ was done. Deception is a Nigerian thing,
anyways.
Now that you are partly
off the hook, I guess this is timely.
The last few weeks have,
indeed, been tough for you. I would rather not remind you of your ordeal. The
bottom line remains that your hard-earned pedigree is desecrated, your esteemed
name now dwells in the corridors of public notoriety. Equating your
relationship with Nigeria as anentanglementisn’t overboard. We treated
you wrongly!
Daddy Magu, may I? May I?
First, your groundbreaking discovery on‘kovid-one-nine’is, no doubts, compelling and indelibly etched into the sands of time. All thanks to you, we now know that corruption is the cause of the pandemic. You needn’t be adorned with a lab coat, neither did you go through the troubles of conventional scientific research, you solved a global mystery before anyone could say Jack; a feat deserving of a Nobel prize.
Add to that, like a dutiful laboratory rat, you had offered yourself to be experimented with; all in a bid to expose the inadequacies and intricacies of the nation’s anti-corruption war. Such kind of selflessness is rare. And that made you my hero.Our hero.
Sir,had you not left your
comfort zone and shown this unbridled patriotism, how else do we get to know
that a government appointee—czar of the anti-corruption agency—can remain in
acting capacity for five years despite the Senate’s refusal to confirm his
appointment and damning corruption allegations against his person?
Without your exploits in
the fight against corruption—including your now infamous Gestapo style,
witch-hunting, media trials and overbearingness—which unmasked the true nature
of the antigraft war, perhaps we wouldn’t have known that the EFFC is merely a
tool of political vendetta in the hands of the ruling party. Also, we are
forever grateful to you for helping us belie the tiring cosmetic tales of
integrity narrated by the town criers ofSir Bubu’sregime.
However, I won’t be a part
of your crucifixion as I know the truth: you aren’t a preacher of love, you’re
a fight, a war and the undisputed liquid metal. Explains why you were
high-handed and ruled the EFCC like an emperor. Real wars, they say, aren’t
fought by cowards. After all, the end justifies the means.
Of course, I’m not
whitewashing you as a saint. The evergreen words of Musician, Naira Marley,
already stated this incontrovertible truth:‘ole ni everybody’, loosely
translated as‘everybody is a thief!’. But the corruption allegations
levelled against you are baseless. Aren’t we fighting a war anymore? Then,
isn’t it logical to have spoils of war? All those relooted funds and mansions
bought in Dubai should be considered as such. As thecorruptlessLagos
Speaker would say, money is for spending! So you owe nobody an explanation.
Well, I brought you good tidings. We, Nigerian youth—whom your principal,Daddy Shockey,once labelled ‘lazy’—are ready to enter the streets in your support. We are most willing to show our youthful usefulness this time around. In fact, a special hashtag has also been created to push our social media advocacy:#MaguMattersToo.
Beyond that, we already kickstarted plans for a two-million-man march in Abuja as a show of solidarity. Remember 1998? When our forebears did the same whileearnestly askingfor a continuity in the bloodsucking leadership of our erstwhile dictator and lifelong benefactor, Sir Abacha akaSinzu Money.The dark-googled General who had helped us keep our money in Swiss Banks ahead of trying times. A man whose generosity is still being felt many years after he kicked the bucket. Didn’t your principal say that he never stole? Yet, recovered loot—pardon my French, I meantassets—totaling $633 million, according toBudgIT, landed in the kitty since the inception of his regime.E no kuku concern me!
All in all, we hope you do
find a place in your heart to forgive us.
Yours pleadingly,
A concerned citizen.

The 10% of zero naira,https://punocracy.com/the-10-of-zero-naira/,2020-07-12T08:12:40+01:00,"This is a work of fiction, and Pastor Ajayi is a fictional character whose behavior is not to be generalized.
You all know that I’m not a judge, not
even a lawyer, but as an ever-garrulous parrot with a follow-come sense of humor,
I was invited by Pastor Ajayi and his church members.
They said, “Our able parrot, this matter is mad o. Are you sure you can settle the matter?”
I hit my tiny chest and assured them.Èmimoderator of the year. Since I don’t want  Pastor or his church members to sneeze on me, I wore my grandmother’sAlàri ìróandbùba,I put on leather gloves and oversize Wellington boots, then I killed the dressing with one face shield that looks like car windscreen. While settling pastor’s matter, I won’t let them settle my matter in isolation center. I stood on the stage, microphone in hand, I first said, “Hello, tum tum. Sound check. Sound check.” Then I said Pastor, you may speak.
PASTOR AJAYI: You see, these people are
very rude and ungrateful.
ME:Ahn
Ahn,Pastor, Why?
PASTOR AJAYI: Calm down, let me talk. Since the beginning of lockdown, these people have refused to send their tithe. The church has not been receiving the alert of their 10%. Even when the church, in its magnanimity, sent bulk SMS to them to remind them, they refused to wire the money. The message even contained the church’s account details o. Still, they refused to send it. Parrot, I am angry. Today, if I hear‘tun tun’on the church alert line, the message is from Glo. Parrot, can you now see that these ones cannot make heaven? Also…
ME: Pastor, let them respond to this one
first. Church members, your pastor has spoken. It is your time to speak. For
each question the pastor asks, I’ll be taking two responses. One from a man,
and one from a woman.
A young man raised his hand first.
MAN 1: Pastor, we tried o. But you know that this lockdown period, there was no money. We didn’t intentionally sin against the Lord. It’s just that pastor, we could not send 10% of zero naira.
WOMAN 1: Parrot, can you hear this idiot? Trykoor, trial period ni. You are stupid o. Don’t you know that if the pastor should share 10% of his net worth in church, we won’t have to work for the next one month? Pastor is now saying,“Yen yen yen, we sent account number but they did not send money.” Pastor, you like money o. Why are you not doing yahoo sef?
PASTOR AJAYI: Man 1, may the spirit of God never depart from your home, but you have spoken like a man with little faith. In the Bible, a poor widow dropped her last penny, and was rewarded abundantly. If you drop your last penny, you will not starve. Woman 1, I can see that you’re not a member of my church. You’re a Marlian!
ME: Ah!
PASTOR AJAYI: Yes now. If she did not
spend the entire lockdown listening to Naira Marley, she will not tell me to do
yahoo. Parrot, see me see trouble, am I yahoo boy?
RANDOM CHURCH MEMBER:Ẹ́ rami Ẹ́ gbami, ṣhey mó jọ́mọ́ yahoo?
PASTOR AJAYI: Ah! The spirit of God has
departed from here. You see, instead of these ingrates to protest that the
government should open place of worship, they were clapping in their houses.
Parrot, is that synonymous to Sunday service? This idiot (points at Woman 1) is
now telling me to share my net worth. It shall not be well with you o. Don’t
you know that men of God are Earth’s ambassadors to Heaven?
ME: She must have forgotten, sir.
WOMAN 2: Parrot, don’t tell us that! I stand with Woman 1. Pastor has private jet; but ordinary tricycle, I’ve not gotten after 12 years in this church. Even Naira Marley did giveaway, but my pastor is here asking for 10% of my poverty.
MAN 2: Did Jesus Christ buy private jet?
Did he wear Gucci? You’re there saying that you’re an ambassador.
MAN 3: Ambassador of poverty!
ME: Let the pastor talk o.
PASTOR AJAYI: Let me talk o.
RANDOM CHURCH MEMBER: Pull the idiot down the stage and scar 10% of his body.
Church members started pulling the pastor down the stage, and since I didn’t want them to settle my matter as well, I quickly carried my Wellington boots and ran as fast as myìró and bùbawould allow me. In my entire life, I will not settle church matter again. Me that I still want to vote in Presidential election before I die, and I haven’t reached 10% of my life span."
"Truth to God, elections in Nigeria are more orderly than examinations",https://punocracy.com/elections-nigeria-more-orderly-than-examinations/,2020-07-12T07:51:45+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Olorun ngbo, we’re on course to see the freest and fairest election in the history of Nigeria. By the time the Edo and Ondo elections are accomplished, even the UN will send us an award for conducting the most decent election in our history. It’s not that previous elections have been imprinted by violence, ballot snatching, and loss of lives and properties, but these particular ones will set a new unbeatable record.
No one should dare inquire, “Must Edo and Ondo elections happen this year?” — it’s rhetorical — except a Nigerian in the diaspora with all accessible information and prior records of peaceful and healthy elections in the country, anyone should be able to boldly say, “COVID-19 got nothing on us.”
Orderly elections are not alien to us in Nigeria. We’ve seen it happen over and over again. We’re even tired of seeing it — so tired that we have a steady decline in PVC collection rates and voter turnouts in every election year. One can even assess — in advance — the level of peace by giving attention to the words of the Umbrella and Broom people. They have been exchanging words of peace with each other as the elections beckons.
It is not the fear of COVID-19 that’ll make us suspend any election. We have all it takes and incredibly patient and law-abiding voters to adhere to instructions and set a new record for the most peaceful and fair elections. More so, Kogi and Ondo people are so anxious to get the election done with, so they can keep enjoying the dividends of democracy; a noticeable element in the way some of them yearn for food, clothing, and shelter.
We can also deduce from this election where/what the priority of the Nigerian Government is. WASSCE has been suspended, but elections can take place. It’s not a pitykaan kaan. You shouldn’t beshockedlike “Daddy shocki”, the man at the helm. By now, every Nigerian should have a good shock absorber.
When they showed us how many prerogatives they placed on education in the National Budget, bootlickers told us, “We have to organise what we have. The little we have must go round the sectors.” Yet again, we have seen how crucial education is to them.
They suspended WASSCE but gave elections the go-ahead. No action is as reasonable as this. In other words, it is easier to control crowds at the polling booths than to control SS3 students at their examination centers. No be so? WASSCE invigilators are composed ofagberosand immature folks. They won’t be able to obey simple COVID-19 prevention instructions. Compare the orderliness in our previous election year to the yearly entropy at WASSCE, you’ll see why the government had to make that call. They are really forward thinkers.
Let me attempt to tell help you justify their wonderful decision, and why it is wiser than anything anyone can say:
Let’s go on with elections. Let’s also pray, fast, and coordinate online religious crusades so that our COVID-19 victim numbers don’t go up sporadically. Even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of COVID-19, we fear no evil. All thanks to our peaceful electoral processes."
"Hushdaddy Magu, don’t leave us, sir.",https://punocracy.com/hushdaddy-magu-dont-leave-us-sir/,2020-07-07T07:10:51+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Kudos to Mr. President on his fight against corruption. Our crusade has just achieved another milestone. The EFCC boss and grand pursuer of all corrupt people — from the most minimal of yahoo boys to corruption ancestors at Aso Rock — was pampered and escorted into the DSS office for inspection and fatherly advice. They want to know how he made it. How he’s residing in a N40 million mansion without any labour. Is EFCC job that lucrative? If yes, let me apply, abeg.
Amidst other questions their naive officers need answers to, the DSS also needs some advice on how he was able to transfer funds abroad via a third party. For only he can do these things, and there is no one like him. No. Don’t say the bush meat has caught the hunter. Say the bush meat volunteered to enter the hunter’s pot.
If not that his recent actions cannot be classified as corruption, I would have feared that he has COVID-19, since he once told us that corruption is the cause of Coronavirus. An assertion my learned colleague stood by, twice.
I hope Hushdaddy can put DSS through one or two things on how to move stuff, especially currencies, from Nigeria to oversea. Nigerians will also like to know how he was able to multiply his income to make him afford all those luxuries. Hushdaddy, don’t leave us, sir. We need some wisdom.
I hope those who still think that Mr. President isn’t fighting corruption can now see that the campaign against corruption is stronger than ever. Except those that eyes are paining.Abiis there any other way to describe it? Since you people have started reading the dictionary upside down.
Corruption has taken a new meaning since 2015. Every available statistic on corruption and transparency has really been in favour of Nigeria since the inception of this administration. If it was not so, the international community will not have accorded us the respect of separately searching us when we reach the point of entry in other countries because of the good things they’ve heard about our zero tolerance for corruption.
Bro, I’m tired. Gimme my change let me alight from this ‘corruption-fighting’ bus. I’m not fighting again. Is it rocket science? How many lives does corruption even have? It is the same sermon Mr. President has been preaching since 1983? Why is he so obsessed with corruption? Are they relatives? When will it diesef?Abeg, let me drop. I leave the change for you peoplejare."
A new instalment of The Number Games film series premiers in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/number-games-film-series-premiers-nigeria/,2020-07-05T08:41:14+01:00,"While Americans are eagerly anticipating a new installment ofThe Hunger Gamesfilm series, in Nigeria – a country that is globally renowned for always being second to none – a rival series franchise has chosen to release the latest installment of its movie series,The Number Games.
From the top to the bottom of the Federation, everyone has caught the flu of the highly contagious Number Games. And as expected, numbers have been flying all over the country – numbers that will make you doubt your sanity andNigerian-nessbut are nonetheless true, at least on paper.
Starting with the ongoing N-Power
registration, reliable news outlets have it that over 3 million Nigerians have
applied for the scheme within a week. In my considered view, this high number
underscores the fact that this regime is doing enough to provide for its
unemployed population. This number could have easily been in the range of a
figure with two numbers preceding six “zeros” if not for the unprecedented
efforts of the committed and fatherly president that we are highly privileged
to have.
In the spirit ofThe Number Games, do not be surprised that only eminently qualified Nigerians will be considered and recruited into the scheme. In Nigerian parlance, to be eminently qualified means you have to come from one region of the country, profess a credo, or align with a political party. To be suitable for thetatty-kays,your application must be stamped by a big-number or a number that knows a big-number or an ordinary-number that knows a number that knows big-number. It is now normal that some sacred numbers are enrolled in the scheme as a form of tribute that shows that the country’s allegiance is to them.
We have not forgotten too that H.E. Muhammadu Buhari made a promise last year to either – depending on the news source one relies on – take 100 million Nigerians out of poverty or create 100 million jobs for Nigerians. I am certain that this N-power project will cater adequately for our job cravings. Finally, millions of Nigerian entrepreneurs and all kind of hustlers can take a breather from all their exertions and quest for survival.  The government needs not bother create an enabling environment for them to thrive. There is enough job and money to go round for everyone who is willing to work.
In another number-related development, a cleaner at the Nigerian Law School has been made thirty-two million richer by the country’s “apex legal academic institution”. I am meant to understand that the largesse the cleaner received in addition to the dressing allowance for fifty-two workers that found its way to the account of another individual was not done in furtherance of any corrupt inclination; it was rather done in the spirit of charity. While our courts have always maintained that they are no Father Christmas that gives what has not been solicited, the Law School is doing better by being more sensitive and charitable to the needs of the poorest of the poor of its staff. They deserve some accolades rather than condemnation.
Like any other game, in the hunger games there are bound to be winners and losers. I am sure that this time around the poor and those far from the echelons of power will have cause to smile once again as their hearts will soon be gladdened by the better-days promises of politicians.
Boko Haram will no longer kill innocent Nigerians but a number of people. The narrative will no longer be that Nigerians go to bed hungry and sick without livelihood and access to healthcare facility, but that a negligible number of our people have transited to eternal bliss. Monies meant to better the lot of a number of Nigerians shall soon be swallowed by a mosquito or stolen across the fence by a gecko only as part of the unreal suspense and the twists and turns of Nigeria’s Number Games."

The cry of a baby police,https://punocracy.com/the-cry-of-a-baby-police/,2020-07-04T09:22:38+01:00,"By: Samuel Olakunori
Shun, sir!
Em, Your Excellency sir, with all respect sir, I have come to inform you of how sad we your hardworking children are.
Ehn ehn, sir you know, of all your children, we are the only ones who have been protecting your good name in the society. We’re hardworking and  have increased the IGR of this royal family, but you have never appreciated us once.
Daddy, do you remember how, anytime you want to achieve your goals, you don’t exempt us; either you send us on a solo or you ask us to join our step-brothers.Hmph, the tens of journalists, activists, and politicians that do not want to bow, despite seeing you with the broom.
Even our seniors — the army, aren’t as supportive as we are. They are not go-getters. You would say they are protecting this kingdom, but how is that profitable to this royal family?
We increased this family’s wealth either through proceeds we gather from the highway or by monetising the bail that is free. We also ensure there is equal distribution of wealth by reducing the population of this kingdom in a bottom-up order.
Cough. Daddy, this may be the last time we will address you with respect if you refuse to hear our humble cry.
Why did you decide to stop our only way of making personal money? ThisCovik 1-9is brought by the gods to repay us of our good deeds. But you have chosen to punish us. You decided to lift the inter-state travel ban; for us the most profitable way of earning money ever.
D’allah maigida, drop what you have lifted, don’t stop our biggest means of income. Bail us from this problem (it is free, you know).
If not, we may have to return to old methods: journalists will again write more statements than reports, human rights activists will have no rights any longer, and the Hushpuppians will become our puppies — we will nurture them till they mature and then eat them as protein supplement.
Remember, Brother SARS is always on the beat."
LAW 101: Introduction to being an ideal law student,https://punocracy.com/law-101-introduction-an-ideal-law-student/,2020-07-04T08:43:47+01:00,"By: SHUTTI, Ridwanullah Olaitan
COURSE OUTLINE:
BRIEF INTRODUCTION
This course is one that is vital and germane to your “existence” as a law student, especially during your stay at the university. The aim is to introduceyegentlemen in skirts and trousers (there is no woman at the bar) to acts, deeds and behaviours expected of you during your stay on campus. It is, however, worthy of note that as important as this course is, most law faculties do not include it in their syllabi. Hence, out of the writer’s magnanimity, he has decided to take you all through the rudiments of this course.
DRESSING
Generally, in law faculties throughout the federation, you’re expected to dress in the customary “black and white” i.e. white shirts and black trousers. Now, here is alife-hack: your admission into a law faculty is an opportunity to improve your fashion sense. Be a “fashionista”.  For the guys, put on blazers and suits in flashy colors. Bow ties are a great choice. Foot wears of all types are also allowed. Sneakers, flats, shoes, sandals, and evenflip-flops. Yes, you read it right.
For the ladies, dress to kill! Slay. Paint the town red. Make your hair in any style you deem fit. Make use of colorful wigs and attachments.
Feel free to appear in your respective law faculties in any type of the type of dressing you deem it fit, YOU ARE A LAWYER (TO-BE)!
SPEECH
Once you accept the offer to study law in any university, your mode and manner of speechmustchange. Ensure that you do way with your “local” accents and inculcate the habit of speaking with either the American or British accent. Fake it if you have to. In fact, your pronunciations need not be correct. I’m sure many of you have watchedHow to get away with murderand you all appreciate how Annalise’s interns speak.
The first thing you should learn in the faculty are legal maxims. Maxims are usually in Latin. An example is‘Nemo dat quod non habet’. In law, maxims can be likened to the proverbial palm oil with which words are eaten.You need not understand nor know the meaning of the maxims. Spice your words with them, especially when you are in the midst of non-law students. Make sure to keep them in the dark during conversations with them. This is to guarantee and increase their respects for you.
CONDUCT TOWARDS NON-LAW STUDENTS
This is the most important aspect of the course. How do you relate with students from other faculties?You must note that once you resume as a student of law, you have transcended the realms of ordinary studentship. You are now demi-gods. You are lords over non-law students. Make it a habit to walk as if you’ve boils in your armpits.
Whenever you have to attend lectures with students from other faculties, on no account should you mix nor interact with them. Divide the class into two equal halves. Even where there are vacant seats among non-law students and there are none among law students, do not attempt to sit with thosepersona non grata. Doing so will expose you to ridicule. More so, you’ve got to separate the chaff from the wheat.
Whenever you have to deal with non-law students, treat them as the inferior folks they are. In case you don’t know, in any standard university, there are usually two courses only – Law and others. Always wear a frown on your face whenever you have to speak to them. Always remind them of the fact that you are not their mates. And, if as a guy, you meet a newbabeand want to introduce yourself, you must find a way of sneaking “Law student” into the first sentence. Believe me, she’s boundto blush herself to stupor.
Law is the noblest of all professions. God forbid the day law students will drag the good profession into the mud by maintaining cordial relationships with students of other faculties, regardless of the fact that they are your prospective clients.
CONCLUSION
Students are enjoined to take this course seriously as it is one of the “foundation courses” that will shape their stay on campus.

Caveat: This write-up is meant to be sarcastic and satirical. Students from other departments are strongly implored and enjoined not to take the content seriously.

Another open letter,https://punocracy.com/another-open-letter/,2020-07-03T09:58:13+01:00,"This is purely a work fiction, and any resemblance to any individual or situation is either coincidental or real. To be interpreted at the reader’s discretion.
“Grace,
ensure that letter gets the greatest coverage possible.”
“Sure sir, you can trust me,” the tiny gazelle replied, her Brazilian-hair-covered head moving from side to side, making her look like the well-paid puppet that she was.
Don’t be surprised, the animals in this jungle behave just like humans. I think you just met Chief Ajagbe, one of the most brutal lions in the jungle. 80 and counting,babais acquiring wealth like he will not die again. Age is a number, and Chief Ajagbe intends to remain relevant in jungle leadership till he dies.
“Busayo, can you see? Another one done and dusted,” he said to his daughter who came in just as Grace left.
“Another
what?”
“Another
open letter, my dear.”
“Daddy,
is it the same letter you showed me last night?”
“Of
course.”
“Ah!Wàhálà wá o(there is problem). Couldn’t you have sent a private letter?”
“My dear daughter, in this jungle, nobody does open letters better than me, Chief Ajagbe,” the lion said, as he adjusted his overflowingÀgbadathat was a little tight around the area of his fat belly. This monster inÀgbadais in the good book of the masses, and like every monster, he is using it to his advantage.
“But
you said that this cub from the south-south was your boy.”
“Busayo,
he was my boy, but not anymore. You see, when a small cub begins to question
the powers that be, he will suffer. You cannot abuse the godfathers and expect
the gods to be by your side.”
“Ahn ahn, Daddy, when will you stop this?
Don’t you know that when a new leader is chosen in the pride, the old lion
steps aside or dies? It is only in this our jungle that the former leaders sit
round a table and turn themselves to watchdogs. It is not good o. You had your
time in jungle leadership, and you enjoyed it.”
“Busayo, you are sick o. Who gave you the right to question me? That Emerald necklace on your neck, didn’t you buy it with money? Is it not this jungle money that we are all stealing? Don’t let me curse you o.”
“Daddy,
I am just saying the truth.”
“Will you get out of my face?Ọ́mọ́jatíjatí(bad child). Thank God you’re also in jungle leadership. Busayo, we are in this together.”
“I was just leaving,” Busayo responded, as she adjusted her head-tie, and walked gallantly out of her dad’s office like the lioness that she was.
“Can you see this one?” he muttered, his pregnant tummy dancing as he settled in a chair too small for his frame.
—Beside the road, at a newspaper stand.
“Akin,
did you see what Busayo Ajagbe said about her father?” a gazelle asked.
“Bala, I did ó. It seems the act of letter writing runs in the family. Why would she write an open letter to her father?” Akin asked as he dug into maize on a cob while moving it from hand to hand as the heat burnt his palm.
“Whether
open or close, the letter rings true.”
“Busayo
is a liar. She is just being used by some greedy lions to ruin her father’s
reputation. I still insist that it shouldn’t have been an open letter if those
things are true.”
“… but you insist that Ajagbe tells the truth even though he keeps sending open letters. Are you sure that you are not being used by Ajagbe?” Dada, a newcomer asked.
“Do you want to be unfortunate?” Akin screamed in outrage, as half-chewed corn spewed out of his mouth, and unto Bala’s face.
“It is your father that is being used, you rude child,” he said, as he stormed off and cursed Dada all the way.
—A couple of months after
“Grace,
make sure this one also gets maximum coverage.”
“You
can trust me, Chief. I will do it beyond your expectations.”
“You
may leave. Do well to close the door.”
“Alright
sir.”
“This
is power. The trust of the gazelles is in me. Leader go, leader come, I, Ajagbe
am the leader’s leader, and I will enjoy this power till the end.”
Ajagbe
dug his already sticky chubby fingers into a bowl of dates as he relaxed in his
chair which would soon need replacement if he kept filling his fat belly with
dates.
—At the newspaper stand
“He
ruined the administration of the last lion with his letters. Now he is trying
to do the same again. What did Ajagbe do when the power of the jungle was in
his hands? He only looted funds and got fat.”
“Bala,
Ajagbe is a senior lion, and he is only trying to help.”
“Akin, is he not a thief and liar as well? We, the gazelles are only pawns in the game of these lions.”
“Bala,
when your elders are talking, you don’t talk!”
“Mr.
Elder, you cannot see past your nose!”
“What have I missed?” Dada, who was always late and had just joined them, asked.
“Another
open letter!” Bala and Akin spoke in unison."
Nigerians using jawmasks ask why ‘the damn thing’ isn’t working,https://punocracy.com/nigerians-jawmasks-thing-isnt-working/,2020-07-01T07:32:18+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Nigerians who have been adhering strictly to the use of jawmasks, among other safety measures to protect themselves from COVID-19, are starting to wonder why they still go on to contract the disease.
The T.A. Report gathered that the jawmask functions both as a clothing accessory and a good luck charm. Ordinarily, it is produced as a facemask but many Nigerians prefer to simply cover their jaws with it to ward off the novel coronavirus.
“I did everything right,” protested Temibami Odelendeyin who called us from an isolation centre in Lagos.
“I washed my hands frequently as instructed, I didn’t stay outside beyond 6 pm, and I used my jawmask at all times, even during Zoom meetings. But I still took ill and, now, I have been diagnosed with COVID-19.O wrong now.”
Another COVID-19 patient who asked for her name not to be disclosed said she has still not recovered from the shock of taking ill despite her “extreme precautions”.
“My mask never left my jaw,” she explained.
“In fact, I always wore masks that matched my dressing. I paid a lot of money to get varieties of it, so why isn’t the damn thing working? It had just one job for God’s sake!”
Stephen Eloghosa, a tailor and expert maskologist (based on two recent webinars), told our correspondent the jawmask is not only considered a physical protective gear, “for some it is deeply spiritual as well”.
“They seem to believe, even though the coronavirus is known to enter the body through the mouth and nostrils, the sight of the mask is enough to kill or dissuade the virus,” he said.
“You know, it is the same way people use sanitisers on a fraction of their palm and a few fingers and then expect that their entire hand is somehow microbe-free. It is either a fundamental product design flaw or our people just aren’t very smart.”
Abdullahi Tapa, an Ebola survivor who has so far not died during the ongoing pandemic, however said it is not always one of the two options. The secret, he told his paper, is faith.
“Don’t get me wrong, you need to wear the mask. But you don’t have to give yourself a headache over it,” he advised. “Wear it however you find convenient. Wallahi, God sees your intention.”
“The masks many people are wearing are not even the recommended ones. They are not thick enough. So why are we disturbing ourselves?”
Recent statistics obtained from a study widely circulated on WhatsApp indicate that 90 per cent of Nigerians believe “COVID-19 is not and will never be their portion”. The other 10 per cent do not think the virus exists to start with.

‘I love my country I no go lie’,https://punocracy.com/i-love-my-country-i-no-go-lie/,2020-06-29T08:08:14+01:00,"By: SHUTTI, Ridwanullah Olaitan
I love my country, I no go lie;
Na inside am I go live and die.
— So sang a great son of the soil.
A country blessed and filled with milk and honey, a paradise for
its citizens, a resort for those in need of luxury, and the greatest country in
the world, with no sense of doubt. Well-meaning individuals from all walks of
life, who are desirous of living a comfortable life, all seek to make my
country their place of abode.
Right from inception, Nigeria has been blessed with great leaders at the helms of affairs who are skilled in the art of governance. Men who have the interest of the masses at heart, and who have the zeal to serve humanity. These leaders, in a bid to perform their constitutional duties, always make sure to fulfill their campaign promises.
Take a good look at our roads for instance. They are all constructed by the best engineers the world can offer. So durable are those roads that within the early years of their construction, maps of various countries of the world begin to miraculously appear on them. A few weeks back, in an attempt to further improve the standards of living of the citizens of a particular community, a politician donated ultramodern and state-of-the-art ropes to goat farmers in that locale. God bless our leaders!
Our power supply is top-notch. Step into any city of my country at night, and you’ll agree with me that Nigeria can be likened to the biblical Garden of Eden.
The crux of all periods in my country is perhaps the time for election. Citizens, out of their patriotism, troop out en masse to vote in candidates of their choices. They’ll form queues and wait peacefully and patiently for their turn to exercise their franchise; in peaceful and conducive atmospheres.
Appointments into public posts are strictly based on merit. Competent and skilled individuals can be sure to get any job of their choice as the only obstacle between them and those jobs are their applications.
Admissions into universities too are also based on merits. Rejoice once you are “armed” with your “straight-As” school certificate and high scores in all other entrance exams. For your worries shall be replaced with smile as soon as the admission lists are out. You need not know anybody at the admission office, nor grease anybody’s palms, before your ambitions manifests.
Students of universities in my countrydey enjoy pass.Their schools have big, airy, spacious and well-ventilated classrooms. Their libraries are filled and well-equipped with textbooks, journals, and other relevant academic materials. They have competent lecturers who are dedicated to making the best out of those students in their care. Generally, students study under conducive and comfortable environments. The zeal for education among the youth in my country is fuelled by the fact that “ready-made” jobs await them on the completion of their studies. Just walk up to any firm with your uncommon credentials and rest assured that you will be gainfully employed.
Perhaps, the best thing that has ever happened to my country is its law enforcement agents. Nigeria has the lowest crime rate in the world due to the efforts of these law enforcement agents. If you’re wronged, you’ll be sure to get justice, whether you’re rich and born with a silver-spoon or you live from “hand-to-mouth”. Weeks back, some ladies were allegedly raped and murdered; and within a few days of the commission of those crimes, the perpetrators were arrested and brought to book. Kudos to our law enforcement agents for they are really trying! Their rewards are not only in heaven, but on earth as well.
Clearly, my country is the greatest in the world and it is not surprising that leaders all over the world are working tirelessly to model their countries after it.
I love my country, I no go lie;
Na inside am I go live and die.

"Barka da aiki, Madam First Lady!",https://punocracy.com/barka-da-aiki-madam-first-lady/,2020-06-27T08:32:14+01:00,"As if the doses of heavy weather the rainy season in Nigeria is pushing into our system is not enough, like the buzzing bee, Nigerians are still busy making heavy weather of things that either matter less or don’t count at all. When our youth gather, their discussion revolves around theirsexcapedes, football and happenings in the entertainment world – no room whatsoever for any intellectually rewarding conversation. Our elderly men only think of how they can assume power and finally get to banish poverty from their bloodline, not minding whose ox is gored by their avaricious cravings. Our women discuss the latest fashion trends in town, ceremonies and gossip about matters they don’t have a clear picture of. Succinctly put, nothing seems to matter to Nigerians, save matters that don’t matter.
It is in light of this local reality that Nigerians have taken to the media to make jest of the kind gesture of a First Lady who was magnanimous enough to empower the women of her statewith a weighty ten bags of pure watereach. Why are Nigerians behaving as ifthey are lacking in the manners and gratitudeon social media? What have those ridiculing the first lady done for their village people? In fact, what good has anyone in their lineage done for a fellow man? It is always the empty palm-wine keg that makes the loudest noise and asks what the country is doing for it rather than what it can do for the country.
I know Nigerians are not gullible but sometimes we allow our disdain and mistrust for our political elite to becloud our judgment. People were quick to cast stones at her without having a full knowledge of what transpired on that day, simply because they read something in print, backed up with a picture or two. I note with dismay the shameful reportage of some of our media outfits who allow their ineptitude to get the better of them and stop them from narrating thetrue stateof affairs.
I have a feeling that this ten-bags-of pure-water story is likely one of such misrepresentations that the media employ to provide comic relief for many troubled Nigerian homes. Assuming without conceding in any way that the report is true, what is wrong with her gesture? What is wrong in getting people to start small in life? What is wrong in her attempt to get our women to be strong?
Upon a deep
reflection on the Holy Bible, my personal familiarity with the reality that
obtains in Nigeria and my expertise in Project Execution and Management, I
would like to speak briefly on this and other miscellaneous matters
closely-knitted to the issue at hand. I hope you don’t expect an expert of my
high repute to be as brief as the godfatherhood of Oshobaba in Edo state, do
you?
Biblically, we have been enjoined not to despise small beginnings. I am sure you must have heard stories of motivational speakers who started their businesses with a bar of soap and have gone on to be CEOs of multibillion-dollar multinational companies. Who would have thought that a shoeless Otuoke boy like Goodluck would rise to the Nigerian presidency back then? There are many stories of small beginnings out there that can inspire one to greatness. It is buoyed with the knowledge of the sacrosanctness of small beginnings that Her Excellency decided to test her fellow women with ten bags ofpure water.
With hard work and determination, I assure you that virtually all the beneficiaries of the the first lady’s kindness will go on to own pure water producing factories. The outstanding beneficiaries will go on to earn the prestigious First Lady Merit Award. The parable of the talents is quite instructive.
Have you ever wondered what is clogging Nigeria’s wheel of development? The answer is simple — the desire of Nigerians to get rich quick. The politician that wants to get rich overnight milks the coffers dry. The trader that wants to fly private jet in a year’s time would sell substandard items at an exorbitant price. The youth that wants to tower above his equals reaches for the same manual as our compatriot that a friend calls “Designer Puppy”. What does that leave us with? It leaves a room in the dictionary for the word “Nigerian scam”. (Yes, you read that well. Check it up!) Despite our efforts and religiosity, we are regarded as fraudsters and drug-peddlers.
Her Excellency’s gesture is timely. She has been inspired by the heavens to minister to us in practical terms and give us the solemn reminder of starting small and making the best of the small things that our hands find to do.
Today, more than ever before, the existence of our womenfolk is dancing a mad combination ofzankuandtesumoleon a precipice. Perennial misogyny, callous rapists, brutal bandits,Boko Haram, corruption, poverty and poor maternal healthcare system have all marked them for extinction. No doubt, they need to muscle-up if they desire to outlive their foes. The first lady’s gift of ten bags of pure water is a welcome development in that respect.
Walking home with ten bags of water should be able to dry their boobs and broaden their chests. Hawking the water around would boost their stamina and agility and also develop the muscles of their lower limbs. At the end of the year they would have taken a form that would ring a bell of fear and panic in the heart of Anthony Joshua. I assure you that their foes would not want to cross paths with our gallant amazons. Who knows? Their regiment may even get to play a pivotal role in the unending war against the Islamic State in West Africa.
It is a common
saying that persistent practice leads to perfection. Being kind has never been
easy and no one is born with the trait.. However, it is with persistent
practice that one can get accustomed to it. I am not saying she is, but who
knows if she is only practising how to perfect her dexterity in kindness? I
assure you that with constant empowerment with firewood, kola-nut, robes to tie
their stubborn children at home; she may grow in generosity to the extent of
empowering them with houses in Dubai and London.
I promised to be brief at the beginning. At this juncture, I’ll like to tell Her Excellency that her effort has not gone unnoticed. The committee of first ladies has been discussing her matter with envy and touting her for the award of the First Lady of the year 2020. We are grateful and pray that the good Lord repays her in kind. On behalf of grateful and well-meaning Nigerians, I most sincerely thank you, Madam First Lady.Barka da aikiand God bless you, Your Excellency."
Satire 404: Navigating the Twitterverse,https://punocracy.com/satire-404-navigating-the-twitterverse/,2020-06-27T08:04:59+01:00,"By: Adedimeji Quayyim Abdul-Hafeez
You see ehn, in this life, no be everything dey need degree if sense dey. The new sense today,my gee, is the whiz of the social media. Your key to success does not lie in education and pursuing careers that may never pay in the end (how many graduates has education helped?) but on how you brand yourself and staywokeon social media.
There are so many platforms which could flame your existence into the limelight. If you are interested in meeting foreign friends and reading long-ass posts, then you should consider Facebook. For people interested in watching comedy skits and“awning”at celebrity lifestyles, you could make headway on Instagram. Do not even consider LinkedIn. (Why struggle to put an entire “CV” of things you have not achieved only to get depressed by “overachievers”?) You like dog selfies, weird emojis and videos of contemporary dance steps? Snapchat and TikTok help with those. But for the uplift of your hustle and headway in life, you have to tweet your way into success. Don’t you see how those influencers earn? Brethren, your path in life would only be illuminated if you know your way in surviving the murky waters of the bird-app world.
If you want to survive on Twitter’s stormy waves, one of the first things you must do is to increase your followers’ list. Your followers must be in the big hundreds or thousands. Follow people to get ‘followbacks’ and unfollow them afterwards (that’s a Twitter hack, by the way). Your handle should be something like@yourfavouriteplug @naijaqueen @netflixandchill @introvertedextrovert @pweetychickng @brezzislife @dempapirichie @OGforlife.
Post stuff like“I’m new here. Show me around”or“Twitter do your thing”to gain new followers. Share your handle on influencers’ posts. Join ‘follow trains’. Have a crazily-weird crafted bio on your profile. Buy followers if you must. The veracity of your opinions and the credibility of your personality are now measured by the number of followers you have on Twitter.
In the course of uplifting your cyber hustle, you must be a Twitter Influencer (even if you have no content and appear to influence rubbish). The easiest way to achieve this is to create or join trends. Join the tweeps if they are settling#TheMatter. Drag#TifeandSansa. Well, condemn#Hushpuppi. Praise#IndaboskiPahose. Give your wild opinions on#SurvivingPeruzzi. Tweet#EgungunBeCareful. Give comments on#Mbah’sHead. Hail#NairaMarley #LordofLamba.
Tell stupid and unrelated pun-jokes in the#DontLeaveMeChallenge. Feign false support for campaigns like the#JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #BlackLivesMatter #JusticeForRapeVictims. Relate to#Bombooclatand#Scopatumanaposts. Drag ‘established’ inflencers. Join conversations you are ignorant or know nothing about. This is to satisfy the quaking appetites of your growing followership. It will keep your notifications and mentions in their widest gleam. All is fair in your race to stardom. That way, you gain visibility and recognition. You would have followers in thousands. Brands would contact you to promote their products. You are on your path to greatness and societal relevance.
In your journey on the bird-app, avoid #IntellectualTwitter, #ProfessionalTwitter and #CareerTwitter like a plague. Tag themthe “aspire to perspire”people.Thou shall have no cause to perspire, Amen?These are people who seek to disrupt your hustle by portraying their overbloated achievements. Remnants of the all-mighty professional Linkedln. Avoid them, for their arguments could make your ineptitude glaring. Your savagery skills would come in handy here in fending them off. Let them eat their articles, intellectual opinions and literary pieces. You could steal their opinions and portray them as yours though (Omo, no worries, your followers dey your back). All is fair on Twitter as long as you are popular and an influencer.
In everything you do, Twitter is your hotspot. Everything you see on Twitter is true and realistic.Fake news reside not on the bird app. Form your opinions from tweets. Think the same way tweeps think (constructiveness helps nobody). Twitter is your new search engine. You think about something amazing? Search on Twitter. You just heard something new? Your friends have probably tweeted something about it. Musa has seen everything at the gate.
You are now becoming a reputable Twitter influencer yourself. Money is on its way. But you need to sustain this image. You have to actualize the rich life your followers presume you are living. You have to keep your Twitter image guarded.Don’t allow anybody to pour sand in your garri. Drag anyone who plans to truncate your hustle. Post your sun-kissed pictures. Slide into DMs to build love relationships. It doesn’t matter if you are serious about your statements (believe me, people would be proud to strike conversations and sustain relationships with you).
Comment on pictures of handsome men and beautiful ladies. Conjure false experiences to give tweeps the impression that you are wise and intellectual. Post savage responses to funny tweets. Strike cordial relationships with fellow influencers. Enjoy the perks of your new lifestyle. Form woke. Flex and chill. Enjoy.
A wise man once said, “Never forget say everything in this life na packaging.” Well, I am that wise man. The easiest way to attain street credibility and public recognition is to be active on Twitter. Twitter is the new University we all have to pass through. Opportunities and good networks abound on the app and it’s your responsibility to be part of the big game. This is the new deal and you have to master how to navigate it. Follow my tips to hit it big and up your game on Twitter,Alaye.

Why rapists aren’t so bad,https://punocracy.com/why-rapists-arent-so-bad/,2020-06-25T06:21:25+01:00,"By: Ayodimeji Ameenat
A lot has been going on lately on social media; everywhere has been tense. A girl was raped in a church and almost everyone got angry and started making absurd comments. Anger is a very valid emotion to feel, but the thing about anger is it removes one’s ability to think and make valid decisions. There is another perspective to this rape thing people aren’t looking at. Everyone is chanting, “It is never the victim’s fault”, “Blame the rapist”, “Rape is a hideous crime”. The thing about all this is that, no one is trying to think from the rapist’s perspective.
It isn’t about what she wore? Haha, it is exactly about what she wore. Women fail to realise that men share a genetic trait with animals that makes them act on compulsion, so when you walk around in a dress and they are able to sense that in the dress, there’s a boob and a vagina, their brains make them act without control. If girls don’t want to be raped, they should try to keep the ownership of these parts a secret. I don’t  know how you’ll do this; I’m a man and my knowledge of this “girl stuff” is limited. So ask your moms how they did it; they have more experience. Rape wasn’t a problem in their time.
Consent can be withdrawn during sex? This isn’t even about not being able to stop a moving train. Have ladies no compassion? How do you get a man so all up in his mood, then when you’ve gotten your share of pleasure, you don’t give him his? Why act so selfish? There is never a reason to withdraw consent.
Okay, maybe this is also about not being able to stop a moving train, because women are able to jump out a train easily, they see it as a sport. Maybe she wasn’t in the train in the first place, maybe she was in front; anyways, she deserved to be hit. She put herself  in that place. Maybe her parent didn’t tell her to stay away from men and trains. She need not stay away from all men though, only the bad ones, and not all trains, only the faulty ones. If she had stayed at home she would have been safe.
Now I know feminists are going to come at me here and go, “Ladies get raped at home.” Yes, they do and it’s because they forget that, even at home, they should not let down their guard. They become too comfortable at home, wearing anything they want, hugging and talking with their siblings  anyhow. When the boys  decide to hug them back, they throw a tantrum. Do you think families don’t find it hard to rape other family members? It’s the compulsion thing, ladies should help their men keep their dignity. Avoid  them. You’d be doing both of you a favour.
“The fact that you’ve had sex with her a lot of times doesn’t mean she wants it this time.”
Can you hear yourself? You can’t get tired of a good thing. Sex is a good thing. And like men, ladies are always down for sex, they just like to pretend. What other reason would my sex partner visit me if not sex? I don’t need to ask her questions I already have answers to.
Silent isn’t consent. A minute silence for the true rape victims — the ones who died. Now do you know how silence feels? It feels like nothingness, it’s  bland. It’s our job as men to add sugar to the bland lives of our women. Asking for consent is awkward; what if she says no? If she didn’t want it, she would say no  even without me asking. Forget the knife in my hand.  Forget her body language. Some things should be about men too.
And why are women making a fuss? Men get raped too. Men get raped by men. Men get raped by women but when men get raped, you don’t see them whining about it. Men get raped, women get raped. Equation perfectly balanced.
Now you might want to say babies get raped, yes, but the world is evolving. Babies are now able to communicate consent without talking and rapists are able to somehow understand, although feminists (and scientists) won’t agree. They hate to believe there are smart veins in the penis that communicate to the brain the consent in the silence and cries of a baby.
This is not to say rape shouldn’t be a crime; it is a grievous one. This is just to say, instead of the hashtagblame the rapist, it should beshare the blamebecause rapists deserve to be heard first.
Caveat: I’m not a rapist and I would never rape anyone. I have sisters  at home and I make sure they never tempt or push a man to rape them. However, shout out to the good men that rape, they give women what they want based only on their commendable and reliable intuition.

The 16 inspired verses of the puppy called Hush,https://punocracy.com/16-inspired-verses-puppy-called-hush/,2020-06-24T07:43:02+01:00,"By:Gracious Egedegbe
These are the verses for the Puppy called Hush.
1. In the beginning, God created the dogs.
2. And a certain dog was without sleep, and horny, and his wife was on the face of the bed. And the spirit of knacking moved certain liquids to leave the dog and enter his wife.
3. And God said, let there be babies; and little puppies sprung forth.
4. And God saw one of the puppies, that he was good, and God marked him for big juicy bones.
5. And God called the puppy Hush, and the rest he abandoned for they were sleeping when Hush was working. For when it was evening in his land, Hush would go to a strange land to source big juicy bones. The evening was the morning and the morning was the evening for Hush.
6. And God said, let there be a mist when other dogs and puppies try to understand Hush’s sources of big juicy bones.
7. And God made a mist. And it was so that other dogs and puppies saw the juicy bones Hush munched on but not the dogs he maimed and killed to get his bones.
8. And God commanded Hush: “When other dogs and puppies ask for the source of your bones, tell them it is I who give you the bones.” So when others asked, the puppy would reply, “Na God o!”
9. And God called those who tried to discover Hush’s sourcesbeefersandhatersand cursed them to poverty.
10. And so Hush grew fat in his land. All the female puppies allowed him to sniff at their rear holes whenever he desired. The male puppy licked his rear hole just for a taste of his juicy bones.
11. Across the divide, other dogs were losing limbs and begged for help from the alpha wolves.
12. And Hush went against his God and began to worship his bones. He made a pile of bones so bigthe alpha wolves could sniff from a mile away.
13. And so God turned his back on the puppy called Hush and the mist was lifted.
14. All the male puppies that had sniffed Hush’s rear holes denounced him and mocked him by day. By night, they prayed to God for mist as they were in search of dogs to maim and kill.
15. And the female puppies that had allowed Hush sniff their rear holes washed themselves and move on to the other male puppies that were doing the work of God by night.
16. And the rest of the acts of Hush, and all that happened thereafter, and his might when he fought against the alpha wolves, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of Hush?

In defence of Sai Baba,https://punocracy.com/in-defence-of-sai-baba/,2020-06-23T06:46:37+01:00,"By: Ganiu Oloruntade
Nigerians are naturally ungrateful. If thanklessness were to be human, the fellow must be Nigerian, no doubts! I pen this piece with all sense of annoyance and utmost displeasure to chastise my fellow countrymen who appear to be unjustifiably critical of President Muhammadu Buhari and his next-level-centred government.
Rather than appraise the servitude of the Daura-born retired General, these recalcitrant elements are busy spewing hatred to malign his enviable image.
For a 77-year-old man who had risked his life to partake in three major military coups; led the country as Head of State; ditched the khaki for the civilian garb; ran for Presidency three consecutive times before his triumph at the fourth attempt, this is undeserving. It is undeniable that the tall and suave Sai Baba is truly committed to Nigeria’s development. Come on, he could have retired to stay home and play with his grandkids but he didn’t, because of his undying love for the country. I would say that he, in fact, deserves a national holiday declared in his honour. It’s perhaps the least we can do.
Sai Baba has many great qualities. His frugality is unrivalled. He doesn’t indulge in wasteful spending. Forget that his rich son, Yusuf, explores the streets of Abuja with expensive motorbikes. Just like his siblings who self-funded their education abroad, the handsome chap sponsors his own lifestyle. I can beat my chest that theold ṣójàcan’t afford such luxury. The Grand Corruption Fighter of the Federation, GCFR, parades a gargantuan hatred for embezzlement and lack of accountability.
I know haters will say that he “looked away” when his cronies—like chief grass cutter Babachir Lawal and Governor Gandollar—were accused of corruption. They might also go as far as referencing Nigeria’s ranking in the 2019 Transparency International’s corruption perception index as the one of the most corrupt ECOWAS countries. Wailers will always wail!
Like the typical no-nonsense father, he is disciplined and abhors indiscipline. Don’t forget that he launched a nationwide operation nicknamed “War Against Indiscipline” when he led the country in military apparel. This explains why he doesn’t condone disgruntled younger minds like Sowore, a failed presidential candidate who apparently can’t pocket his loss at the polls and is thus championing a fictitious revolution. Baba, having rehabilitated the nation’s correctional facilities (prisons, you say?) to world class standard, housed the Sahara Reporters Boss and his accomplice, Bakare, in one of these special apartments for some months. He did this to simply teach them a few lessons.
His genuine interest in the youth, however, remains unshaken. After all, a man can’t watch a lion feast on his child, no matter how repugnant the lad is! Laziness seems to be the major reason fueling this supposed anti-system narrative, an idle man they say is the devil’s workshop. These youth think they can just “sit and do nothing and get housing, healthcare, education, free” simply because “Nigeria has been an oil producing country”. As the popular street lingo by musician, Koker, goes:kolewerk!Well, out of his benevolence, Baba has provided jobs for them which include “clearing of drainage, sweeping markets, road maintenance, traffic control, and cleaning of public infrastructures like health centres and schools”. What more can you ask for?
I’ve seen these clowns compare Sai Baba with Donald Trump, the Twitter-lousy President of the United States. That’s completely absurd to me. While Trump is a pronounced lowbrow racist, PMB is a remarkably detribalised Nigerian. Though, he is quite fond of ‘inviting’ his kinsmen—an example is Mamman Daura, a native of his hometown, Daura, who headed the DSS until his exit—to serve in government but that certainly doesn’t confer him with the derogatory nomenclature ‘ethnic bigot’. I mean, there’s nothing bad in surrounding oneself with ‘trusted people’. Also, Sai Baba is a respecter of women, Trump isn’t. The latter is infamous for ‘groping’ women, our dear PMB respectfully puts them in their place: the kitchen, the living room and the other room!
They call him incompetent and wrongly label him as indifferent to happenings in the country. I beg to differ. In his usual charismatic manner, Baba has expressed shock at the sudden resurgence of a “technically defeated” religious extremist group. Mind you, a number of their repentant counterparts have been rehabilitated and are soon to be reintegrated back into the society.
While the theatrics at Aso Villa, featuring the nation’s First Lady, is yet to be completely doused, little did we know that it’s all part of a grand plan to spice up Baba’s regime. Governance shouldn’t be boring for Christ’s sake! A tinge of drama isn’t bad after all. Aren’t we indeed lucky to have him? I’d leave you to decide that yourself.

Designer puppy,https://punocracy.com/designer-puppy/,2020-06-21T09:16:15+01:00,"By: Mustapha Maryam Boluwatife
“A very good morning to the esteemed and important citizens of Zootopia. The next story from the entertainment world had me choking on my coffee this morning. Word from the streets of the zoo has it that a very popular puppy from Zootopia’s commercial capital just got a new million-dollar mansion. This puppy is known for his Gucci puppy collars and chains. His extravagant lifestyle, and expensive outfits have made him the role model of many other animals even though his source of income remains unknown. Off to some commercials, we’ll be back soon on Zoo celeb gist hub to give you more Zootopia celebrity gist.”
“Oga, don’t you see sense in what this
woman said? This puppy’s followers are too many o.”
“Can you now see, Corporal Ajaye, that you are stupid?” the sergeant said with his mouth open as he consumed a large chicken lap which his mistress had just brought in a warmer.
“Ah! oga.”
“Yes now. So because he doesn’t have a job, he shouldn’t dress well? You that you have a job, is that why your trouser has a hole in the back? A whole officer! In fact,ojúgbàmítí(I’m ashamed simply because of my association with you),” Sergeant Apala said in his thick Yoruba accent, proving that, indeed, he is one of the children of Idanre.
The poor corporal covered his rear with his hand as he left, even though his new Aba-made boxers still made an appearance.
“Òníkátíkátí(unserious fellow),” the sergeant said, as he dug into the fleshy wings of another chicken.
“Ah! Abike can cook,” he said as he adjusted his seat, in preparation to peacefully consume the remaining content of the food warmer.
—A couple of weeks after.
“What is this reporter’s problem with this
puppy? She has problem o.”
“Oga, what has the reporter from Zoo celeb gist hub done again?” Corporal Ajaye asked.
“Ajaye, can’t you see the way she has been
moving her mouth from the left to the right? She is making her mouth look bad
just to bad-mouth the poor puppy.”
“Sergeant, if I should talk now, you’ll
say that my mouth is smelling.”
“Ajaye, talk. I know you brushed this
morning.”
“Oga, this puppy is a thief, a criminal. The bible said no food for a lazy man but this particular lazy puppy is not only eating but also wearing designer.”
“My friend, if the bible said that, then there is a reason he is a puppy and not a man.”
—Two months later.
“Designer puppy has been, arrested, Oga,” Corporal Ajaye said, while jubilating and trying to dance the Zanku dance but failing woefully.
“Kíní? (What?) A police officer is jubilating that a promising Nigerian was arrested. Ah! I shake my Idanre head for you, Ajaye.”
“Oga, promising Nigerian? He was a thief o. They arrested him for stealing, abi is it defrauding someone sef?” Ajaye said as he scratched his dark, bald head in an attempt to remember the puppy’s exact offence.
“Yes, promising. Is he not bringing back
the money of our great-grandfathers that is stuck in those foreign countries?”
“…but sergeant sir…”
“Butkọọr,

The Antericans,https://punocracy.com/the-antericans/,2020-06-21T09:05:12+01:00,"By:  Mustapha Maryam Boluwatife
This is purely a work fiction and any resemblance to any individual or situation is either coincidental or real. To be interpreted at the reader’s discretion.
—In the laboratory of Anterica, the land of ants.
The king of the Antericans sauntered in,
in his well pressed suit. His raccoon-like blonde hair shook slightly as he
climbed the stairs (this particular ant has hair). “Why doesn’t this fucking
lab have an elevator?” he cursed. Need I tell you that the king needs to work
on his language?
“Where are these fucking men in ghost-white
lab coats?” the king’s TV presenter voice boomed, disturbing the specialists
working hard to find the cure to a novel virus. The king wasn’t smart, but he
was the king anyway, so they left their work, and formed a semi-circle in front
of him. “Took you long enough,” he said in that voice that hurt the ear.
“One of you is going to go out there and tell Antericans to start using Chloroquine.”
“But sir, it has not been tested and…,” a tiny black ant said on his left.
“…and she’s black…hahaha” his laughter, that belonged only in a children’s movie, interrupted her as he squeezed his too large face to look like a clown.
“One of you is going to do it because I ordered it, period!”
—In the home of an Anterican.
An ant sat quietly in his house while he sipped a cup of coffee and awaited a copy of his favorite newspaper. This old-school ant still does things the old way. He believes if it isn’t in the paper, it isn’t the news.
His paper arrived a few minutes later
after his coffee had gone cold, so he asked that it be re-heated. “Bianca, have
you seen the news? This is crazy!”
“I have, Scott. What part?”
“The part where the King approved the use of Chloroquine, and the Anterican medical laboratory workers advised against it. This wouldn’t have happened when I was young.”
“Oh! Keep that, Scott, you’re no longer
young, and King Trumpet is the king, so deal with it!”
—In the Anterican palace.
“King Trumpet, people are angry about the murder of a black ant.”
“OK. What the fuck is the point?”
The pretty female ant who brought the news ran after the king as he kept walking without slowing down.
“…but sir, they are protesting.”
“Tell the ant in charge of the special
squad to get them off my fucking streets!” he screamed while not slowing down.
“Sir, this might ruin your reputation. The media awareness is too high, everyone is trending #BlackAntsMatter.”
“Just make the fucking call. That’s an order,” he said in a sing-song voice from the entrance of the palace.
“Hard choice, Grace, hard choice. But it’s an order so I have to do it,” the pretty ant muttered to herself as she made the call.
—In the house of an Anterican.
“Bianca, I told you this wouldn’t have
happened when I was young.”
“What’s it again Scott?”
“In one month, Bianca, a black ant was killed, the king is planning Anterica’s exit from the World Ant Health Organization (WAHO), and now he is poking his nose in the affairs of a development bank in Antrica.”
“Don’t bother me with that, Scott,” Bianca said, as she waved dismissively.
“…but Anterica is your country, Bianca.”
“…and the king has gone mad again Scott,
so deal with it!”"
"Doctors, think out of the box!",https://punocracy.com/doctors-think-out-of-the-box/,2020-06-20T08:11:30+01:00,"By: Ibrahim Williams
Another breeze of discord has blown and
unveiled a new contour in the rear-view of the medico-presidential chicken.
News has it that a novel war of bickering has occurred between the
ever-demanding resident doctors, and our very responsible, sensible, and
admirable government.
A few days ago, the epileptic romance between this duo took a Titanic cruise to the iceberg — again. The resident doctors, fed up with the enjoyable heat in the hospitals, decided to catch some fresh air on the street while singing the lyrics of a breakup song which highlighted the government’s pregnant promises to make working in hospitals a bit less conducive.
It seemed, nonetheless, as though the doctors have been so busy sleeping in the wards that they didn’t get to know about the much more important things the government has been up to lately — like, say, approving N27 billion for the renovation of the House of Assembly.
Among their claims, they accused the government of neglecting them at the forefront of the battle; a claim which appears rather cynical. I mean, this is just a bunch of men and women who all they’ve done so far is leave their families and loved ones, put their lives at risk to take charge of saving victims of the virus. But then, compared to the selfless and patriotic inaction of the government who sit comfortably at home to make sure everyone in the country is safe and fine, who does the more tedious part of the job?
A particularly irregular point these doctors made was that they had asked for personal protective equipment severally and that the government was yet to respond in kind. One would somewhat assume that these guys are only being petty about their requests, as it sounds ridiculous to let people die just because you don’t have PPE? Is it not obvious that what the government is trying to tell them is simply tothink! out! of the box!
By thinking out of the box, they could, for
instance, remain in the world-class medical structures that the government has
provided, use the washing machines to wash the PPEs when dirty; or they could
borrow from other health workers who are off duty; or at the best, invest in
their own safety by buying these PPEs themselves!
When one has a government as proactive and responsible as is in Nigeria, it is only complementary to assist in whatever way necessary. After all, a wise man once said, “Do not ask what your government can do for you, rather ask, ‘What can I do for my government?’”
At this juncture, I would want to assume that the government is doing everything humanly possible to salvage the situation. As a matter of fact, I have a positive premonition that a fifteen-man committee has been set up to look into the matter. And their response will be available in about six or eight weeks from now. While they are at that, it is my honest hope that citizens behave civilly by contracting the virus as the government will keep the hospitals running with its experienced cleaners, nurses, and gate-men who are committed to dutifully fulfilling their works without too many complaints. Unlike some people.

"Egbon Aruleba, how dare you insinuate Nigeria is a Marlian Republic?",https://punocracy.com/egbon-aruleba-nigeria-marlian-republic/,2020-06-19T08:57:46+01:00,"Dear Uncle Gbenga Aruleba,
For the umpteenth time, I feel coerced into picking my pen to address an issue that under normal circumstances I wouldn’t have bothered myself with. Since the Coronavirus-ravaged era that we find ourselves in is a far cry from the normal, it is imperative for me, as part of the few right-thinking individuals of this era, to address what many are calling your folly. My passion has no room for niceties; they are therefore saved for future times. To the crux of my letter I shall sail.
In the aftermath of the small matter of Naira Marley’s flight from Lagos to Abuja and back, from the depth of oblivion you appeared on our airwaves to attack a gentleman who doubles as a president and a role model to many progressive and patriotic Nigerians. That was not just it. You went on to make the absurd insinuation that there may be elements of the Marlian World Oder (MWO) movement in the esteemed Buhari government.
Just so you know, I am not the type that calls a spade a blade or something that it is not. Therefore, I make bold to say that your annoying remark is a ploy for you to drive yourself to prominence like Aunty Linda and Bobrisky. Also, we know 2023 is not far away and there are rumours in a section of the Nigerian media that some of your kinsmen are prepping you up for a cash-out at the Villa. Based on this knowledge, I am not entirely surprised by this silly insinuation of yours.
Do you know what it means to be a Marlian? Did you bother to Google what the global Marlian movement is all about? I shake my big head for your version of armchair journalism. In words that are as brief as the reign of a tyrant, I shall hasten to educate you on some of the the tenets of the Marlian movement, then go on to seek a parallel with what obtains in Nigeria.
To be a Marlian is to have a thousand trousers with zero
belts, to sing and gallivant all over a stage, naked to the waist. To be a
Marlian is to breed dreadlocks on one’s sacred head – a part of the body that
is revered by the Gbagyi people to the extent that no load is permitted to
settle on it. To be a Marlian is to slay virtues and salute vices. To be a
Marlian is to have due regards for the people and the law. There is more to
being a Marlian than time and space can allow me to elaborate on.
Uncle Gbenga, how many officers in Buhari’s administration have you seen wearing trousers without having a belt strapped around their waists? Maybe those who prefer to wear our traditionalagbadas, babanrigaandjalabiyasthat don’t require belts. It is preposterous to term them Marlians. For Gosh’s sake, we are talking of officers who embark on a looting spree to enable them purchase the choicest items on offer in Paris, Rome and New York – items they have need of and those they may never use, expensive belts inclusive. That aside, have you considered that their young chicks – those ones young enough to be their daughters – would think of them as irresponsible, stingy and demented for not putting on a belt? That is that.
No official closely associated with the incumbent government has been associated with singing and dancing. The senator from the Confluence State that tried, endured several plots to arrest and jail him before he was finally sent packing from the hallowed floor of our upper house. The said senator has since stopped pulling off Marlian stunts. He now makes a living as a world-acclaimed conspiracy theorist. The travails of the senator started on a mere suspicion of him being a Marlian sympathizer. The government couldn’t wait for our snail-paced court to adjudicate on his guilt or innocence. What does that tell you? The incumbent regime cannot condone the mere display of any Marlian trait.
Marlians are known for their relentless battering of the frontiers of virtues. This is not so with the officials in Buhari’s government. Buhari is an embodiment of virtues. You would recall that it was by virtue of his virtues that Nigerians brought him to power despite the machination of the corrupt government of that time to disenfranchise him for his inability to produce what looks like a WAEC certificate. It was the same Buhari who served gallantly in the army, served as minister of petroleum, ruled as Head of State and later occupied the chair of the Petroleum Trust Fund without taking a dime from the coffers of the Nigerian government. It is unthinkable to think that such a man would surround himself with people of questionable virtues like the Bullionvan man, the “corrosive” ex-governor from a river close to the Cross-River, and their kinds.
Mannerless Marlians, is that not how they refer to themselves? The present government officials loot our coffers with manners. They don’t go about flaunting their loots like their predecessors. What more can one demand for from a Nigerian government official? So well-mannered is this government that it cannot allow criticism to continue without persecuting the critic. I do not know of any responsible father who would sit and watch his child baptize with scorn and rain insults on people old enough to birth him, under the guise of constructive criticism.
I know you know the good manner in which this government obeys court orders – of course, it is beyond reproach! I won’t bore you with the exceptional manner in which it manages the issues of threat to the sanctity of the Nigerian life. The government has recorded so many victories on papers. According to the reliable utterances of politicians, residents of the president’s Katsina, my southern Kaduna, and Gubio can now sleep with their eyes closed. Like it was asked about Jesus, the masses in Nigeria have been asking: What manner of man and presidency is Buhari’s? Do you still feel the government is Marlian? Well, I just disproved that notion by pointing out that, unlike the Marlians, Buhari’s government is well-mannered and has well-mannered officials from the top to the bottom and right, left, and centre.
Dear Uncle Gbenga, I can go on and on but you know it is not beneficial to occupy our days with an unending letter. It is important that I conserve words for the day when providence shall bring us together to have what the French call a head-to-head. Before I drop my pen, I need to emphasize that to be a Marlian is to do all the wrong things that exist in the world. Buhari’s government is renowned at home and abroad for doing all the things that are right, holy, and laudable. The enviable feat of this government is unprecedented in Nigeria’s over 105 years of existence. I wonder the kind of weed that is making you insinuate the presence of Marlians in Buhari’s government or to think thatMarlians ti take over– in other words we are living in a Marlian Republic. If you must continue weeding, then change your supplier sir. He is harming you.
Be guided, uncle!
With utmost concern,
Nephew Gwanzwang."
Becoming a campus journalist in Nigeria: A satirical guide,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-campus-journalist-in-nigeria/,2020-06-18T08:48:09+01:00,"By: Adedimeji Quayyim Abdul-Hafeez
Well, you had just got an admission into a higher institution after you had pulled strings by troubling your “connection” with pleadings to make your admission granted. This was after you had written the JAMB exams for so many times that the JAMB body had to put you on its watch list and subsequently admitted you as one of its persistent candidates in the hall of fame.
You had passed through the very embers of fire; after all, you got your admission into a course you didn’t apply for — well, it was said on the news that not so many people applied into your assigned faculty so some admission aspirants had to be moved there. And after you paid your acceptance fees, you were cleared into another department. You must have really gotten sad but your friends said you were ungrateful for not thanking God for getting entrance into the institution.
Like the strong-willed patriotic Nigerian that you are, you do not want to lose out entirely. You look for ways to impact on the campus and thicken your skill set. You have got to thicken your CV for recruiters and employers who require a five-year experience for the job you hope to apply for as a fresh graduate. Trust me, I come with the perfect panacea:be a campus journalist and shoot into limelight.
You are done being celebrated as a local champion. Those commendations you have on WhatsApp groups for posting your writings are not enough. You must blow on campus. Do not fade into darkness. How better can you stay admired, feared and respected at the same time by the school management, student politicians, and the student populace if you are not a journalist on campus?
My
good friend, I come with glad tidings. I come bearing tips on how to make it
fast on campus. Follow my tips and become a Nigerian campus journalist cum
celebrity.
You need to groom your personality to suit your newly found discipline. You need the skill set for your status as a campus journalist. All these could be achieved by joining a press organization on campus. Don’t they claim to have folks who write for reputable newspapers? Don’t they claim you are bound to make it by joining their membership? Join the league in your journey to ‘prosperity’.
My friend, in the course of becoming a journalist on campus, you must be non-partisan. But who are you to shun politics when you know everything about life is political, including your admission? You have to outsmart those press bodies by portraying yourself as the saint they think you are. I know it would be hard but it would come in handy during your second semester when those political aspirants box you into corners to reel out the ‘paradises’ they couch into manifestos. Remember to flash your teeth and tell them you’re a pressman (it comes with its perks).
Your
new career would be too demanding but you have got to shoot into limelight
really quick. Where do you have the time to report events, write articles,
attend press meetings and draft editorials when you have got coursework? Repel
those thoughts of multi-tasking and coping under tough challenges. I have
gotten a life-hack: join committees and remain inactive. The Publicity
Committee is the best bet.Shebi na to
send BC?
C’mon, smile like you are one of
the wise men the stars led to Bethlehem.
In your quest to blow as a campus newsman, you must get a press ID and a press tag. If possible, get a press jacket or vest, which you would convert into your ‘uniform’. Students on campus must know of your new god-given career. Feign humility when they hail you as a pressman and a man of truth. Smile when you are called the voice of the masses. Glow through campus with your newly found position. Attend events and sit in spots reserved for the press. Do not forget to request for the ‘press package’ after events (winks). Rejoice inwardly, for money is coming!
Rule 5: Explore politicians
To make it as a successful pressman, you must be the nemesis of student politicians. Know their dark secrets. Threaten them as the true watchdog that (you think) you are. Strike fear into their chicken-clouted hearts. Bloat their fizzling courage and egos. Make friends with the rich ones, for they are your goldmines. Accept brown envelopes! Criticize not the school management, for they hold the keys to your expulsion. Be in their good books. Enjoy the bounties, for they are the rewards of your hustle. Rejoice, for these are bounties from the Lord for your hustle in achieving greatness.
Well, the good news is that you are now a campus journalist. The bad news, however, is that you must never allow ‘anything’ to truncate your hustle in the realm of journalism. Avoid the Disciplinary Committee of your campus press outfit like a plague, for they are leprous to your hustle. Argue pointlessly in meetings, stating facts within and beyond your proposal. Show people that you are ‘conscience of the masses’, for you are the mouthpiece of the citizenry. Buy shirts and face caps with inscriptions like “Press Freedom”, “Free Campus Press”, “We Must Be Free”, “The Oppression Must Stop”, “Voice of the Masses”. Wear tattered clothes. (Because how else would people know what you undergo in voicing out their opinions?) Be always ready for “Free The Press” protests (that’s the best way to appear in photographs to be published in the dailies).
Remember in the second rule stated above, you must pretend to hate politics. If you follow these rules religiously, you must have become a campus celebrity status on campus, or perhaps you have been listed as one of the most popular influencers. But forget not that you must remain in the limelight. Now is the time to explore other terrains and being a politician is your best bet. Resign from your campus outlet. Of course, they would ask questions but what can they possibly do? Contest for political posts. Bankroll on your political connections. Use your previous ‘impacts’ on campus as your selling points to win the seat. Build your “motivational speaking” career. Narrate tales about your days of glory and exploits to students and lament sadly that the press is failing on campus since your exit from the world of journalism. Show people the transformation in the political sphere since your involvement in campus politics.
These rules would make you thicken your experience column in your CV. Follow them strictly and you are on your way to become a successful journalist and achiever on campus. Step up in your hustle,my gee.

I want to help your life so that you also can become somebody we will tell “yes sir” in this hell of a life. And the only way to do that in this nation of ours is to be big. When I say big, I don’t mean Osinbajo big o – big that you’ll be big and you’ll not be able to demonstrate your bigness, is that one big? – no, not that kind of bigness. The kind of bigness I am advocating for you in this life is that Orji Uzor Kalu big. Big that you’ll be big and all your enemies will be left clutching the air in your wake, big that can make you approbate and reprobate even before the highest court of the land,  big that,chai, I’m talking too much.
See ehn, If you don’t ever achieve anything else with your life in this Nigeria, the least you can do for yourself and your family is to be big. If you won’t be big for yourself, at least be big for your extended family and future generations. Your great-grandchildren twice removed would praise your name like we praise Abacha’s every time we receive his alert from the abroad.
Why am I advocating for you to be big? Simple. You see, the perks of being big in this Nigeria ehn… It isoga-n-tableuncountable.As a big man in Nigeria, you can be a convicted felon and still hold a legislative seat. Like… You will be leading your constituency in absentia from your prison cell. This is the ultimate flex and no other flex compares to it unless of course, you’re Sinzu.  Sinzu money.
As a big man in Nigeria, you can never stay long in prison. This is because when big men are in Nigerian prisons, they are well-behaved model citizens whom every inmate are charged by the prison officials to emulate. They are not like small men who go on hunger strikes and scream injustice because they have not attained the status of big men and as such, they do not have legislative cells at their disposal nor buttons to press to make their stay more luxurious.
When a Court of Justice gives the order for the release of a big man in  Nigeria, that order is immediately complied with by the prison officials who know that they are big and, as such, do not need to be protected.  For these big men, a motorcade is usually on hand to sweep them out of their legislative cells to go and be continuing their bigness from where they stopped in the real world.
In the case of small men, the situation is different. Small men need to be protected from society and from themselves. Who knows, a million and one things such as a bus jamming them immediately the prison officials comply with the order to release them can happen and God forbid they die before they taste their much-needed air of freedom.
When big men are released from prison, they, unlike small men, are not treated as pariahs in society. Rather,  their fellow big men often constitute themselves into a committee to go felicitate and jollificate with them on their successful release from prison… all on TAXPAYERS’ MONEY.
At this point, I have already run out of steam, but I believe you understand the gist of all I’m saying.
Do not, I repeat, do not be a small man in Nigeria. It will end in tears.
By any and every means possible,hook o, crook o, just be a big man.
Never say I did not do anything for you.
Shalom."
‘We cannot go back to camp now’: Union of Covid-19 Corps Members writes NYSC,https://punocracy.com/union-of-covid-19-corps-members-writes-nysc/,2020-06-14T11:13:01+01:00,"A group of youth corps members, under the aegis of the Union of Covid-19 Corps Members (UCCM), have called on the NYSC to shelve plans to have members return to the orientation camps soon, considering the health risks.
In an open letter obtained by Punocracy and signed by the national secretary, who refused to disclose their name for obvious reasons, UCCM argued that the camps are already serving as isolation centres and will not be safe for habitation anytime soon, especially because of the potential psychological trauma to corps members.
Here is the full content:
The DG NYSCYakubu Gowon HouseAbuja12 June 2020
Dear Amiable DG,
I have heard in the news that the DG of NYSC met with the DG of NCDC so they can proffer solutions to how corps members will be able to go back to camp and modalities to observe post-pandemic after the inter-state lockdown.
I understand that NYSC has the interest of corp members at heart and they are doing their possible best to see how corps members will stay safe while also finding a way for them to complete their 1 year mandatory National service.
But the truth is that looking at the nature of this pandemic and worrisome daily increase of the carriers, we can’t comfortably be planning to reopen camps. May I bring it to our consciousness that same camps have been used as isolation centres. Some corps members will be allergic to going back there knowing what it has been used for. It will create some level of allergy and psychological stress for some of them.
Looking at the measures NYSC is proposing for the NCDC to adopt, it begs of me to ask these questions.
I hope those measures will include:
You see, dear corps members, going back to camp without this pandemic finally dying down is not feasible. I don’t see any workable strategy whatsoever. Stay wherever you are and stay safe.
We are all serving Nigeria, likewise our Senators and Reps, same with the Armed Forces and Executives and Judiciary. We are all serving the same Nigeria, so we shouldn’t be treated as if we are less important. We can’t be used as sacrificial lambs.
If there is any parent or ward that will allow their wards to go back to camps that have been used as isolation centres without properly making sure we have defeated the pandemic, mine cannot be in support of that.
If NYSC tries to force us back, we will reject it with all sense of dignity and humility. And we will protest if need be. They can’t be at their respective homes and offices observing social distancing and staying safe, while we go out there and expose ourselves. It is health and life we are talking about here.

"Benue politician donates ultramodern, state-of-the-art ropes to goat farmers",https://punocracy.com/benue-politician-donates-ultramodern-ropes/,2020-06-14T10:03:20+01:00,"BENUE (The T.A. Report)― A politician in Benue state, Daniel Ukperaa, has adopted an innovative way of discouraging open grazing in the region bydonatingultramodern, state-of-the-art ropes to goat farmers.
The T.A. Report gathered that the yellow, 3 mm polypropylene plastic ropes, imported directly from Taiwan, were custom-made for the Red Sokoto and West African Dwarf goat breeds that are commonly reared in Benue.
If used correctly, the ropes are capable of reducing goat rustling by 70 per cent and other cases of missing goats by as much as 65 per cent, the politician explained.
” —And all you have to do is tie a noose with it, place it gently around the goat’s neck and tie the other end to a heavy, preferably fixed, object such as a wall or a pole,” he added as he demonstrated using a nearby plastic chair.
“The ropes are child-friendly and you don’t have to be an expert to use them,” he said with a grin.
“We deliberately picked this tinge of yellow because of how effectively it reflects sunlight. Our experiments show that, viewed from the right angles, the ropes can blind wild animals and herdsmen who try to get too close.”
Ukperaa said even though the ropes were expensive to procure, the sacrifice was worth it to safeguard lives and properties in the state.
He urged the federal government to introduce the rope distribution programme across rural communities in Nigeria, saying it will alleviate poverty and create millions of jobs for young Nigerians who can locally produce and recycle the ropes as well as help farmers in both tying and loosening them. He further promised to distribute many more if he is elected into the state House of Assembly in 2023.
“Let me tell you something,” Ukperaa giggled with excitement during his speech. “The best thing about these ropes is that they are multipurpose. After selling your goats, you can also use them to hang your curtains after you replace them, your clothes after you launder them, or maybe even yourselves whenever you are fed up with the way the country is going.”
Fidelis Madaki, the youth leader of one of the beneficiary-communities, appreciated the politician for his foresight and generosity.
“Before, we used to use rags and substandard materials to tie our goats, but now we can tie them according to standard best practices all over the world,” he said.
“Indeed, our lives will never remain the same. But we hope the honorable, in his next project, will consider giving us goat food, so that we don’t end up tying dead animals, and maybe also empower us with more goats as well as other domestic animals.”

We hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the results of anyone’s credulity or mischief. Do not take us seriously. We repeat; do not take us serious! … On second thought though, maybe you should do just that."
All hail President Daddy Shock-ey!,https://punocracy.com/all-hail-president-daddy-shock-ey/,2020-06-13T09:47:30+01:00,"June 10, 2020. Buhari, perhaps too shocked to personally deliver a message to Nigerians after an attack too many by the technically defeatedBoko Haramon a village in Borno’s Gubio LGA, tasked one of his oracles – Garba Shehu – to address the populace.
The message was a familiar one – in the same predictable and worthless words in the Queen’s hallowed language. Part of the release stated that the president “…isdeeply shockedby the killings of tens of people…” Of course, we all know how the address ended and how the matter shall be addressed. For the benefit of doubt, here we go  —
How the address ended:His Excellency is awaiting briefing from the governor of Borno and the Chief of Army Staff superintending affairs at the Coliseum that that jewel of the North-East has stooped into.
How it shall be addressed:Having being briefed on the incident, a committee shall be set up to look into the attack and make recommendations on how to prevent further attacks.
Today, I do not
intend to denigrate or bring to ridicule the president of a crippled giant of a
blessed continent like most satirists and unpatriotic Nigerians do. It is my
sole aim to bring to light an exploit of the president that is often overlooked
– a feat that by now should have found its way into the Guinness Book of World
Records if Nigeria is a country that is appreciative of the efforts expended by
her leaders.
To put this matter into proper perspective, I’m inclined to point out that His Most Esteemed Excellency wasn’t shocked when Nigerians brought him to power after falling short in his past seventy attempts to return to the helm of affairs — though queries were raised over his academic qualification that is so good the Nigerian Army had to save it in its museum to be used in motivating new intakes to aspire to greatness and excellence. Neither was he shocked when Nigerians forgave him and returned him to power by lawful votes cast, despite his woeful performance at the examination that was his first term.
When he assumed office in 2015, he was shocked at the scale of corruption in the country. That accounted for his ill health and his many medical tours abroad. But the strongman from Daura survived that onslaught.
Upon recovering from the attempt at his life by the prevailing scale of corruption in the country, he was electrocuted by the dismal state of the power sector. Remember, he promised Nigerians uninterrupted supply of electricity within months of assuming power. We all knew that he survived that threat too. Nigerians can testify to the improvement in the power sector that is so real it can only be seen in the pages of tabloids.
The next problem to shock him was the infernal rage of Boko Haram in the North-East. The protracted armed confrontation chased sleep away from his life until he was able to technically defeat the so-called Islamic sect that detests the notion of peace and tranquility. In the aftermath of a particular attack that claimed scores of lives, he was shocked to the extent that he could not visit the scene of the incident; his health could only afford rendezvous at the residents of the governor and the emir of Borno.
According to some moderately reliable news sources, the president has survived over a thousand and one electrocutions without journeying to the land from which there can be no return. Both hardcore and soft-core Buharists have been hailing him as the Nigerian version of the proverbial cat with multiple lives.
How many countries in Africa can boast of a leader who can ensure this many electrocutions and still defy death to tell the story of their resilience? Our problems can only be taken care of by a man who has been shocked severally but has nevertheless refused to take a bow. Is that not the Nigerianvolksgeist? The invincible and indomitable spirit we are made of and renowned for all over the world.
Our president boasts
of a superb, fantastic and world-class Naija-made shock absorber. Authoritative
sources on technology news have it that Germany, China, Japan, USA, amongst
other countries are vying to acquire the patent.
Moreover, have you
given thought to the fact that Nigeria’s road to El Dorado is bumpy and
extremely rough? It is imperative that we continue with a man that can
withstand the shocks that await us.
Having said all
these, I bear no doubt that General Muhammadu “Daddy Shock-ey” Buhari is the
man to lead us to the prosperous Nigeria that we are longing for. I therefore
support him to continue as our president for the duration of his life.
All hail President
Daddy Shock-ey!

May Nigeria not happen to you,https://punocracy.com/may-nigeria-not-happen-to-you/,2020-06-12T08:48:00+01:00,"By: Raheem Gbolahan Hammed
Brethren! Kindly leave whatever you are doing at the moment and join me in a short prayer. Errrm. May you not be a victim of Nigeria. May Nigeria not happen to you! I can’t hear a louder amen. At the end of this sermon, you will appreciate the short prayer I have blessed you with. And oh! Don’t bother, I won’t be collecting a dime from you. I am not your typical religious leader.
Nigeria is about to happen to you if you think your first class certificate will automatically land you your dream job. Then you see the job requirements; 4 years’ experience, less than 26 years of age,et cetera, but remember you left secondary school at 17, wrote UTME thrice, only to have your programme spaced out with the help of ASUU strikes and internal school strikes.
If you are part of the youth who believed the APC’s promise in 2015 to create some outrageous number of jobs on a yearly basis, then Nigeria has happened to you!
When I was in the states, we called 911 at any slight chance to report emergency cases and the authorities always swung into action. But if you report a case to the Nigerian police via a distress call, the vans won’t have enough fuel to proceed. If you take enough initiative to walk into the police station, you will either be detained as the prime suspect or would be asked to pay N2,000 (or more) as mobilisation fee. Brethren, may Nigeria not happen to you.
While it is very important to pray against Nigeria happening to you at the police station, you must also intensify your prayers against Nigeria happening to you at public hospitals. From the Accident and Emergency unit (A&E) to other wards in an average public hospital, you are greeted with the true reflection of the Nigerian state; corruption, negligence of duty, inhumane treatments just to say the least. In case you see an accident victim, or someone with gunshot wounds, don’t bother taking them to a Nigerian hospital, you might end up with their Nigerian police counterpart, and that’s Nigeria right there, staring and smiling at you for being too good. Long story short, you might have to wear a blue uniform behind rusty bars for the rest of your life.
If you take a stroll to the judiciary, Nigeria will again happen to you! There is really no way you want to escape it. You are sure of being on trial for as long as ever. Meanwhile, your politicians get bail for stealing billions of naira, diverting public funds into personal accounts and the case ends there. If you think I am joking, the other serving senator that was dashed a jail term, has he not been released? Did your senate president and other senators not go to his house to appropriately welcome him? The other young, fair senator that harassed a lady in a sex toy store in Abuja, why is the justice taking like forever?
Your favourite Governor’s son, whose father you are tipping for the presidency come 2023, did he not threaten to gang rape a woman online? Duly backed by his mother. You write about it, your editor relieves you of your duty, and that’s about the end. That is you being a victim of Nigeria!
The bullion vans that entered a private bank on Bourdillon Street, your anti-graft agency is yet to probe. Your House of Assembly speaker has about 64 bank accounts, he is yet to be duly prosecuted too. But if the police find more than three ATM cards in your wallet, you are declared ayahoo boyand your trial starts immediately.
Have you been to a club before? To unwind the
stress of the week or to have a nice time, and you are randomly/forcefully
arrested, press briefing follows the next day, and your image is all over the
media as an internet fraudster with or without adequate trial. That’s Nigeria
happening to you right there.
Again brethren, may Nigeria not happen to you! May you not be a victim of Nigeria!"
The road’s prayer: A Nigerian road’s supplicative commentary on the Paternoster,https://punocracy.com/the-roads-prayer/,2020-06-08T08:03:05+01:00,"Our Father who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
You deserve all the glory, honour and adoration. You made the earth and all that there is. You made the poor man and the insanely corrupt rich politician who impoverishes and sends him to early grave with an emaciated body that is a delight to undertakers.
You made my counterpart in heaven with the finest gold and
left me at the mercy of Nigerian politicians. Ah, Nigerian politicians! Not
even Beninese politicians or Somali tribal warlords? Since you’re
unquestionable, respect to thy holy name!Tuale!
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.
Like St. Paul,Maranatha, a cry for your return doubles as my daily mantra and supplication. I was foolish to trust in the leadership of Nigerian politicians – People’s Destruction Party (PDP), Anti People Congress (APC) or even the sexy soundingFresh Yo!Party – to upgrade me despite their many promises to the citizenry. I have long realised my sin and repent of it and place my trust solely on you.
To mark my repentance, I have rechristened myself “Godswill”. I earnestly crave your will takes place in my life. I don’t want to take the golden form of the road in heaven. I don’t deserve it. I don’t want to be guilty of the capital sin, avarice – despite the fact that I am Nigerian and corruption is said to be my second-nature. Neither do I want to be close to the decent roads of Benin and Togo. That will be asking too much. I just want to be able to come close to the alluring roads of Douala and Garoua. Nonetheless, may your will be done in my life.
Give us this day our
daily bread.
Without the regularpatch-patch, I am condemned to take a nondescript form. I am bound to lose the companionship of Nigerian vehicles, especially the expensive ones acquired with ill-gotten wealth by Nigerian politicians who would rather disturb our ears with the rock music of their ‘helos’ than manage the roads they have failed, refused, neglected or omitted to list for repairs.
Please, impress it upon FERMA and its state counterparts to continue giving me theagegebread of theirpatch-patch. Half bread, they say, is better than none.
Forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
I need your forgiveness for the many potholes that I have
allowed to demark me. I seek thy forgiveness for the many lives cut short
plying me. I am mute and powerless to either begrudge or deal with the men that
carved me into the dreaded monster that I am. Therefore, I am left with no
option than to forgive them their trespasses. But it doesn’t mean I won’t burst
forth in joy when they perish plying me – “For when the wicked perish, the city
rejoices!” Who am I not to rejoice?
Lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from all evil.
Like humans, I have conscience too. I am not bereft of sentiments and emotions. I am sometimes tempted to annihilate Nigerians for the manner they have been treating me.
When accidents occur, the poor masses blame and curse me. They regard me as a demon and an agent of their village witches who needs to be exorcised by the most precious blood of Jesus Christ. What an abuse of a precious substance!
It therefore comes as no surprise that when accidents
occur for no fault of mine, they also invoke the fire of the Holy Ghost to
descend and consume me as on the day of the contest on the mountain between the
Prophet of Fire and those miserable Indaboskians of Bahose.
Every year, billions of money that the can break the jaw
of a counter are allocated for my manicure and pedicure in the budget. Those
monies are always too blind to locate me. The only place they know is the
coffers of the same old corrupt politicians. The little that manages to locate
me is usually shared with contractors who are always keen on having the lion’s
share. Hence, my dreadful state!
The most annoying part of my ordeal in the hands of Nigerians is that they use my name to campaign and win elections. As soon as they are elected, they forget me and their promises to me and the gullible masses. In another four years, they will return to make the same false promises and still gain elective posts.
Poor commuters too are not helping in the way they misuse and abuse me over and over again as if I am a whore who relishes BDSM. Some prosper by robbing poor people who are travelling on me, raping and kidnapping some. Who takes the blame for those atrocious acts? Your guess is as good as mine. There is nothing thatlocal Nigerian Roadhas not seen.
You would agree that it is onlyroad-yof me to harbour and nurse contempt for Nigerians and be tempted into annihilating them every now and then.  But I’m guided by the fact that only “Our Father who art in heaven” has monopoly over vengeance. Thus, it is unbecoming of any being – animate or inanimate – to wander into that sacred jurisdiction.
While I pray for deliverance from temptation, I also seek thy protection from the evil machinations of Nigeria, her politicians and road users. I anticipate your coming on the day of doom. A day you will give to all Nigerians the measure of what they have given me. A day you will ask Nigerians their most important existential question: The wealth I have given you, how did you utilise it? I shall be there to witness Pa Lie and his offspring stutter to stupor. That dayehn, tables will shake and break.
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever
and ever. Amen!"
"Satire 0-1 News: Well-behaved inmate, peace deal with bandits, and other stories",https://punocracy.com/satire-0-1-news-well-behaved-inmate/,2020-06-06T08:54:09+01:00,"Facts are oftentimes stranger than fiction just as news is oftentimes more hilarious than satire. We live in a world (or country?) where journalists have, without intending it, become greater comedians than professional humorists. Don’t believe us? Keep reading.
The governor said the bandits have continued to carry out attacks with their accomplices from Zamfara, Kaduna and Niger Republic which have led to “indiscriminate killings” in the state. “The armed bandits have betrayed our trust in them, following a peace agreement earlier negotiated with them, in our quest to find a lasting peace in the state,” he was quoted as saying. ”We chose dialogue for peaceful coexistence in the state and we have done our best; yet, the attacks continue.
He said when all indices are taken into consideration, the present government since it came into power in 2015, has done better in the area of job creation than it had projected. “Absolutely,” he said when asked if the Buhari government has done well in its job creation drive. “If you take all the indices into consideration, I think this present administration has outperformed what the projection should have been.”
When asked by the presenter to confirm if he said they were coerced into the donation, the lawmaker affirmed his earlier statement. “Yes, we donated the salaries because of the progress of Nigeria but I’m assuring you, most of us were not happy about it, that’s the truth. “It’s Just the way you see workers not happy about salary deductions without their consent.”
When asked about Kalu’s six-month stay in prison, Njoku described him as “a well-behaved inmate; he did not give us any trouble at all.” Kalu was jailed for 12 years on December 5, 2019, after he was convicted of N7.1bn fraud alongside his firm, Slok Nigeria Ltd., and a former Director of Finance in Abia State, Jones Udeogu. The Supreme Court, however, nullified the convictions on May 8 on the grounds that the judge who presided over the case lacked jurisdiction.
“The voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. But the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. The devil and all his agents shall surely pay for this. I don’t know what hospital that records the kind of healing that the church of God records. And now hospitals, where people die every day, are open, but the church is closed because the oppression of the devil has no medical cure.”
“They brought to Jesus all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them, according to Matthew 4:24. If there is nothing that the government is hiding, let them reopen the churches and bring the victims to the house of God. I know the God whom I serve, and I strongly believe that He is able to heal all diseases. I took up this Ministry with pure conscience.”
Ahmad in a tweet on Sunday, May 17, stated that the Second Niger Bridge after its completion will be a gift that will keep the Buhari’s administration in the minds of Nigerians for a long time.  His comments, however, drew some criticisms from some Nigerians who faulted his narrative on the grounds that the money used for the project was paid by taxpayers.
Akintola said the realities of the Nigerian economy call for government’s attention ”particularly as they affect keepers of the house of God”. “MURIC therefore advises the various state governments to speedily devise means of getting special palliatives to the clerics in the churches and mosques. “They deserve attention at this crucial moment because they have nowhere to go. They should not be turned to beggars. They have served the government at various times. They should not be abandoned in their hour of need.
Akintola alleged that the reaction of the NCDC to the deaths in the state suggests that there is a deliberate attempt at debilitating the northern population. “Is this a deliberate attempt at debilitating Northern population with its attendant impact on Muslim majority population in the country? He demanded for an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the alleged closure of NCDC office in Kano state as well as the lack of testing centres in the whole north.
Okotie also condemned CAN’s proposed recommendation of distancing in the seating arrangement in churches as “blasphemous infidelity” and desecration of the Church of Jesus Christ. The pastor explained that extending social distancing to churches would compel reordering of seating arrangements and determine the size of congregational worship per service. Okotie argued that to accept such an arrangement was “to nullify the redemptive work of Jesus, which involves healing.”"
From pit to palace: The rise and rise of Nigerian prisons,https://punocracy.com/the-rise-and-rise-of-nigerian-prisons/,2020-06-06T08:16:19+01:00,"“Wetin dey for name sef? E no matter de name you call mess, im go still smell pass shit”– William “Ibu” Shakespeare (1999), “An Excellent Conceited Tragedie of Ali and Simbi”.
The above sentiment is Shakespearean, Elizabethan, English
and archaic; therefore it holds no ground here in Nigeria, especially in our 5G
era.
In Nigeria, an upgrade, no matter how insignificant it appears, calls for a rechristening. When you roam about Facebook, for instance, you may come across a Kande Kurushepe going by the new name of Yummy-Kandy Krueger-Sheks. Why? She has now acquired a cheap made-in-China Brontel Android phone and has caught up with the teemingwebizensof the 21stcentury on the World Wide Web.
Kande Kurushepe, sorry, Yummy-Kandy Krueger-Sheks, is a microcosm of Nigerians and their leaders. It is in this light, buoyed by its victory at the incredibly credible polls that ensured the incumbent soldiered on for a second-term as the chauffeur-in-chief of the change conveyance, that the administration transformed the Nigerian Prison Services (Prisons) to the Nigerian Correctional Services (correctional or custodial centres). What a change! And a long awaited one at that. To Nigerians, a new name works like magic. It does not just protect one from evil but can transform a rotten institution overnight.
There was a prophet whose prophecies spoke of events to occur in the near and distant future. This was a long time ago.Long longbefore electricity found its way to homes, long before metallic contraptions started competing with eagles and hawks for the global airspace. It was a time when the earth was the centre of the universe and the earth was still flat. It was the epoch of the holy prophets and not the Bet9ja ambassadors who only thrive in predicting football games andwrestlemaniacpreachers of war carved from the hustle and bustle of Onitsha.
That prophet of old saw a time when prisoners shall be
elevated from pit to palace like it happened to Joseph the dreamer. Listen to
him:
“Arise and shine for the goodness of
the president rises upon you.
Those who endure the hell of Kirikiri
have since seen enjoyment.
Arab princes and children of the
affluent shall envy thee.
See them coming to you, coming to eat
from thy crumbs
And clothe themselves in your most
tattered rags.
The finest shall always nurse thee to
health and longevity.
India awaits thy health if it fails
to respond to our doctors
The devil shall regret charting your
path to the centre
Such is thy reward for electing a
competent man as president.
When your days are over you shall cry
and beg for some extra time
But you shall be made to see a
Nigeria better than you left.
And you shall be fully integrated
back to the society.
Your rehabilitation is such that you
can be the next Sanjo
O Prisoner burst forth rejoicing,
your redemption has come.”
Having treasured the above prophetic utterance all my
life, I was not surprised by the recent renaming and attempt at reforming the
prisons. Who, in his right senses, will not rename an institution after having
it graced by some famous names?
It came about that Nigerians got tired of its politicians
and leaders engaging in corrupt practices without covering their asses
properly. This ineptitude of those who should uphold the honour and glory of
the country in the Criminal League of Nations forced well-meaning Nigerians to
act fast in order to salvage the country from being relegated to the lower
rungs of the ladder. The London palaver of Prince James of Deltland is quite
instructive and readily comes to mind.
First in recent history to embark on a sabbatical to our prisons was the Incorruptible DSP himself. A man who pleaded guilty only due to his age and only to save the country the money allocated to prosecuting him — a case they cannot successfully prove in the court. He also wanted to save the government from a public backlash for persecuting a man for acting in a manner expected of a true Nigerian politician. Although he only spent hours there, the hours were long enough for him to find out that our prisons were not as bad as the media is portraying them to be. It was then he realised why Obasanjo was able to emerge a powerfulpresidoafter years in incarceration.
But before Oga DSP, it would have been Lucky Dion of Edo. Knowing the abundant goodies that awaited him in prison, he respected his old-age and accepted a plea bargain that saved him from a spell behind bars. That’s what you get when your name is Lucky – lots of luck.
Nigerians voted another set of (holy-holybut the
same old) corrupt politicians, washed clean by their redeeming act of defection
to the ruling party. A prudent move, I’d say. Acting like a monkey to catch a
monkey. It wasn’t long that they set out on a hunt for their games. They went
for those who are not for them.
James Bala Ngilari went on an excursion there for some
days before a superior court redeemed him from the malevolent machinations of
his village people who were envious of a chicken change that he merely
relocated to his pocket.
This regime of anti-graft campaigners is no respecter of titles. They picked up the jolly good Reverend Jolly Niamey—A man that added so much gloss on the face of Taraba State. I hear he has ten more years behind bars. Josh C. Diarrhea of the great Plateau is now recounting his good deeds while relishing the comfort of his new habitat. A certain governor who thought he could rob God’s Own State and go free has tasted the flavours of prison, came out, and as God liveth he may return.
It is this prison coming and going (like Abiku?), that has prompted the government to expedite action in making our prisons a fantastic world to live in. Besides, there is the x-factor of the opposition taking over power in the next election, wanting to expose the outgoing regime, and repaying them coin by coin.
With COVID-19, we realised that the abandoned health sector could be our saving grace. It won’t be long again before we realise that our neglected prisons are what many big names will rely look up to survive and come out sane, if it is possible. With the love we bear for our politicians, we hope that the neglect of this miniscule detail won’t make our politicians meet their Waterloo there. Learn they must from the story of Maurice Ibekwe.
The rise and rise of our prison by number of inmates has come to stay. The rise and rise of high profile inmates has also come to stay. All the while as the rise and rise of our prison-life is only in names.Naija, I dey hail ooo!
I assure Nigerians that at the rate at which our leaders are going to prison and with the constant change of the men at the helm of affairs, the change will not just be in name alone but in infrastructures, structures and treatment of prisoners. Don’t be surprised that sooner rather than later, our prisons shall be transformed into edifices like the one Escobar had built specially for himself."
On rape in Nigeria: Hot takes from the wisest among men,https://punocracy.com/rape-nigeria-hot-takes-from-wisest-among-men/,2020-06-03T10:17:22+01:00,"I don’t know why men are so intelligent, I could almost question nature on the subject. Why apportioning so much intellect to the male gender? It’s really unfair on the female gender, how could one side of the rope get the biggest slice of the bread? Could it be that God is a male or – well, since Jesus was a man and they say he was the reflection of God… case settled.
When men talk about some societal issues, you just have to take a pause and marvel on the wonderful work of God. Such brain and level of accuracy, men never fail to hit the bull’s eye with their takes.
A lady called Uwa was raped and killed while reading inside a church. She was clubbed like an animal, battered around her face and body and her skull was almost cracked open. She struggled to stay alive for three days after the events, but she couldn’t hold off the pain. She gave in to the trauma, the physical and emotional pain, and finally breathed her last. Her father said she couldn’t sleep and neither could she open her eyes and, anytime she tried to, it was always tears that’d drop.
Well, that is that on that now, before you start a pity party. Before youawwand curse out the rapist, before you even do anything, take a minute and listen to what the wisest among men have to say on the matter. I bet you’d not be able to help yourself but tostantheir level of cognition.
“Oh! She went to read in the church? When did church become a library? Why would you carry yourself to go and read in a church, you don’t read in the church… you pray and worship in the church. Church is where you go to seek refuge from God. There is something fishy there, don’t you think? Left your home for church just to go and read… Nah! We are not buying this, there is definitely more than meets the eyes.”
“God knows what she was wearing, don’t be deceived, have you seen what those girls wear to church on Sunday? Oh my Gog! We should not let sympathy cloud our judgment and stop asking the right questions. We should ask of what she was wearing, was it skimpy? Did it open her cleavage? Was her laps showing? Was the dress inviting? When we have answers to these questions, we can now have a direction to stir this matter. It is really hard to be a man these days, everywhere you turn, it is indecent dressing. If you look right, it’s bare breast winking at you to come and touch. If you look left, it’s yansh trying to set you up. It’s really hard to be a man.”
“Boys are also getting raped, why are we acting as if we don’t know? Don’t let us make a fuss. Men are very vulnerable to sexual abuse and nobody seems to be having that conversation. When are we going to start protecting the male child? Why do we leave them to the wickedness of women who always want to have a fill of our innocent young boy’s penis, impregnate them, give them diseases and ruin their lives forever? Women who take turns on our boys, beat them, woman-handle them – leaving behind physical scars, emotional scars or lifeless bodies. No, It’s not men who rape men, men can’t rape men, men don’t rape men. It is women with thick muscles, broad chest, heavy and scary mustache and perverted appetite for sex that rape our boys. Who will stop those women? Who?”
“Our boys can’t walk through the assembly of women without their legs trembling – wishing the ground to crack open and swallow them, without the fear of getting abused. Our boys can’t enter a cab or bus full of women without the fear of getting groped or gang raped. Our boys can’t even go to school without their female lecturers coarsing and blackmailing them into having sex, At night, our boys can’t walk alone on the street without getting verbally or physically abused. In work places, women keep abusing our boys – threatening to take their jobs if they don’t give in sex, touching their breast and bum. Our boys can’t be left alone with their mothers or aunties, grandmas or any elderly women.”
Sincerely, it was more than this but permit me to stop here. I don’t have the mental prowess to understand some of the takes. Your IQ level should be on 500, your operating system must be core-i90, and you must be running on a 5G network to decode them all.
So tell me, aren’t men just so wonderfully intelligent. It is really hard to comprehend how the female gender can’t see how the other gender is scared of them. They are tired, men are human and women should respect that. They should stop raping men and let men be."
"Fuel scarcity, power cut: Things that could go wrong with a SpaceX launch in Nigeria",https://punocracy.com/things-that-could-go-wrong-with-spacex-launch-nigeria/,2020-06-02T08:02:58+01:00,"TWITTER (The T.A. Report)―  Understanding full well the gifts and talents of their country, Nigerians have taken to Twitter to postulate how differently a space launch would go (or have gone) in Nigeria — if one were to ever take place that is.
SpaceX, an aerospace company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, made history on Saturday as the first commercial outfit to carry humans (in this case, NASA astronauts) into Earth’s orbit. It was also the first time in nearly a decade that humans traveled to the orbit from US soil. The spacecraft docked with the international space station the following day.
Because they could never stop comparing their country to those in the developed world, Nigerians wondered how this event could have played out if it took place in the giant of Africa.
“What would a made-in-Nigeria SpaceX launch look like?” one researcher, Trojan (@ichtrojan)asked on Twitter, titling his study ‘Nigerian SpaceX – A thread of a million things that could go wrong‘. And the responses, featuring the various characteristics of the typical Nigerian existence (from corruption to police brutality, party politics, and so on), could not have been more spot-on.
“They will probably use diesel for rocket fuel to save cost,” Trojan himself suggested. He also said the astronauts would be seen wearing spacesuits made of ankara and the mission dashboard would likely be built using WordPress.
Here are the reactions from Nigerians who, as confirmed by our expert analyst on analysing expertise, truly know their beloved country inside out:
Rocket no gree start. Go call Segun Rewire.
Or why did we give innoson the contract?
I was about to tweet this ????????

"Happy 21st birthday, Democracy",https://punocracy.com/happy-21st-birthday-democracy/,2020-06-01T11:44:58+01:00,"By: Ibrahim Williams
On this occasion of your birthday, democracy, please accept my condolences.
It is with a heavy heart that I serve you this
congratulatory message to mark the twenty-first year you were born onto this
land. Funny how it feels like yesterday when the Khaki boys consummated the
marriage that led to your christening by Prophet, Doctor, Evangelist, General,
President Baba IyaboAlagbada. How time flies my dear.
You might be in wonder as to why I have decided to write
this for you when you and I know I love you so much that I shouldn’t have cared
about this day. But then, should there be a reason to insult one’s favorite
wife?
I choose to recount your story in retrospect — for no reason other than the fact that I have known you to fancy backwardness in your affairs. Yet who am I to question your choice of motion? In this past two decades plus one year, the only progress you’ve witnessed is the exponential growth in the number of people that wear your title as citizens, of the democratic republic (of Nigeria) — see how difficult it is to even say your name.
Demo, Democracy. It’s a funny tragedy that the countrymen who witnessed your christening had so much hope in your future: like, you were going to grow so fast and so robust that your health and development would mean wealth and betterment for them. And that maybe, just maybe you were the divine shelter that would shield them from the blessed rains of the Khaki boys. Fortunately, and unexpectedly, you cat-walked over the red carpet, and choose Aso Rock as your lawfully wedded home.
Yet, who no like better thing?
From this rocky-home, a lot has happened. In fact, the number of achievements you have attained as a toddler, and till this moment, sits you comfortably in the high ranks of odious democracies. It is in this house that you have created the system of systems where kings become kinglier, and the subjects are mute and repressed. You fortified the kitchen with dubious utensils that bake and serve corruption, nepotism, and avarice as national cake.
It is in this house that you sat to establish and orchestrate the circus of political clowns who give us, your countrymen, a source of laughter amidst abandonment and pains. Democracy, who can mention your name without a glorious curse for your role in creating the institutional nonsense we live by?
Speaking of institutional nonsense, you remember how one of the first things you established was a reformed Nigeria? Ha! Good old days. A Nigeria with a doomed legislative building, sorry domed building called the National Assembly where family reunion is held every now and then between former khaki boys, holders of umbrellas, holders of circled stars (which today is a luxurious broom), and other distant cousins. Remember how you and these highly placed ‘higher’ animals established agencies in multiple repetitions? And created avenues to fatten their stomach like cows, by any means necessary? Before now that you allow them do more of sleeping and practicing Anthony Joshua with chairs and punches than making laws that bring smiles to the common people.
But let’s not focus on one positive alone. Under your watch, you created jobs and joys that were unimaginable for thugs andarea boysby encouraging Nigerians to come out every four years to sing the democratic anthem with our thumbs. During this national exercise, we have seen miracles unseen by the Israelite under Moses — you know, the likes of those stunts and acrobatic disappearance that ballot boxes do. More importantly, the touch of economic generosity which you add by sharing a cup of rice to voters willing to starve for four years is just top-notch. On top of this, you have helped us create snoring political parties that don’t even campaign during the election because, you know,the big men will settle them regardless.
Following this, your massive clampdown of press freedom these past five years is a new tune to your sad music. You have thought of it in all wisdom that Nigerians don’t need to be feed with old information about the mismanagement going around, for medical reasons of course! So I understand why you have become a chameleon who wears forest green on Mondays, dashiki on Tuesdays, suit and pant on Wednesdays, agbada on Thursdays, jalabia on Fridays, senator attire on Saturdays, and boxers on Sundays.
But it’s all good!
Permit me, at this juncture to pray to the All-mighty Lord to bless you, your kinsmen, and associates the same way they have used you to bless us. And that in a million years to come, they and their unborn generations who will lick from your sour soup be faced with the hardship enjoyed by the common man. In fact, I’m suddenly in the mood for prayer. I pray to God to grant the curses of all of the misled citizens of the country whoshufferandshmileduring the day, and sweat in discomfort during the night, yet are issued powerful power bills to pay. May the bountiful woe of God reach all the ‘higher’ animals in government agencies who have helped and still helps us keep our national asset safe in their personal vaults. On this occasion of your birthday, Democracy, I put you and your usurpers in the court of God to judge.
No thank you, no bye-bye to you."
"Sleep comfortably, sweet corruption!",https://punocracy.com/sleep-comfortably-sweet-corruption/,2020-05-29T09:39:58+01:00,"(A LAMENTATION ON THE DEATH OF AN INNOCENT JOLLY GOOD FELLOW)
Another May 29 is here. A day that was formerly set aside for Nigerians to celebrate a change in the system of government – a departure from the out of vogueKhakicracyto the aberration that looks more likedemocrazythan democracy.
Not long ago, Buhari, clad in his full regalia of
integrity and egalitarianism, felt he could no longer withstand the fact that
South-westerners enjoy an extra public holiday more than Nigerians from other
geopolitical zones, especially his North-West. He decided to nationalise June
12 and trivialise May 29 – a fair decision I must admit.
The president with all his former militaryruggedity n’ gragracannot wipe clean the significance of May 29 in our hearts. Its significance is not just borne out of the fact that it is the anniversary of the dead of the former Democracy Day. This year’s 29thday of May is significant as it is on this day five years ago that Buhari declared the mother of all wars on corruption. His acceptance speech on that historic day in May 2015 marked the gradual death of Corruption. The story was told of how Mr Corruption could not withstand the superior firepower of Buhari’s highly motivated anti-corruption soldiers.
Upon a deep reflection on the life and times of Mr Corruption, I was provoked into shedding a tear or two for that innocent jolly good fellow. Who can say that the lot of Nigerians has not improved now that Corruption is no more? I dare such a person to come out from his closet and make bold his or her claim.
The officers of the Nigerian Police Force no longer regard brutality meted out on the citizens they are meant to protect as an act of corruption (in the broader sense of the word). SARS has now transformed into a Brutal Force that is loved by all. Theologians have propounded that in order to live long in Nigeria, you must do the following three things: 1. Fear SARS 2. Fear SARS 3. Fear SARS. I won’t talk about the road taxes they are collecting daily on behalf of FIRS. The Police are only covering for the ineptitude of our revenue collection body. It is only a foolish person that will call the noble and kind “Acts of the Police” corruption.
Since the death of corruption, the cost of living in Nigeria has greatly dropped. In Lagos, Port-Harcourt and Kaduna, Nigerians now go to bed with three sumptuous square meals properly lodged in all the crevices of their stomachs at the cost of N150 only. Very soon, Nigerians in other cities shall begin to enjoy same.
Who does not know that the economic class war died with Mr
Corruption? As it is now, the only class we have is the upper class. The
beggars we have on our streets are only a bunch of misguided persons who
rejected the flamboyant good life on offer for an austere life in the trenches.
Despite their decisions, the government is getting them to rethink same and
return to Nigeria’s table of abundance.
The judiciary has regained its long-lost glory as the last hope of the common man, and as an incorruptible entity. Gone are the days that justice is perverted. But once in a while, they auction Lady Justicia to the highest bidder in order to sustain the plenitude on our tables.Na from wia man dey work e go chop, na why Mama Charlie people dey call am “workchop”.The last time that agents of the executive arm desecrated our courts and a judge presiding over his court had to run for his (not, her) dear life was during the lifetime of Corruption when FDF was the ruling party. The incumbent government happily and sheepishly complies with court orders – an unprecedented feat in the annals of Nigerian history.
But for the constraint of space, I would have loved to discuss the goodness of our roads, the permanence of the supply of electricity to our homes, the efficiency of our institutions, the security of the populace, the fairness of our elections, and the appropriate utilisation of Abacha’s countless gifts to us from the afterlife. I need not tell you that we are no longer the world’s  poverty capital. That title is now Uncle Sam’s.
With the demise of corruption, Corruption as a word is now
opposite in meaning to Nigeria. Buhari’s exploits in the warfare against
corruption is well-documented and is being studied in military and war colleges
all over the world.
Madam Abike Dabiri-Erewa and her diasporans are returning
back to the country like the prodigal son, in their thousands, begging to be
accepted back, even as fourth-class citizens. The fear of being exiled from
Nigeria has made Nigerians the most-behaved citizens in the world. Shekau and
hisgengcould not bear the possibility of being exiled to poor UAE or
Saudi. They have therefore surrendered their weapons.
While we revel in our new found bliss, we cannot but pray that corruption continues to comfortably sleep in peace. It is of Corruption that it was said:“May there be many a summer morning when / with what pleasure, what joy,/ you stumble upon pleasures felt for the first time / …/ Corruption made us to do better / Without her dead, we would not have bettered our lot. As it is now, Buhari has nothing left to offer us / He gave us the marvellous life we are now enjoying” –(haters may claim that this satirist parodied C.P Cavafy’s poem, Ithaca).
On a final note, I call on the presidency to set aside May 29 for the celebration of our dearly beloved, Late Mr Corruption. Is it too much to ask of His Excellency?
Happy May 29 folks!"
How to get away with (extrajudicial) murder in Nigeria: A beginner’s guide,https://punocracy.com/how-to-get-away-with-murder-nigeria/,2020-05-28T08:50:29+01:00,"How fortunate one must feel to be a Nigerian, to come from a country where absolute freedom is not a myth and impunity reigns supreme. When a great man (we are not sure which one) famously proclaimed that “your liberty to swing your fist ends just where my nose begins,” he certainly had not heard about the wonderful country called Nigeria. He, especially, betrayed his ignorance of that special creature known as the Nigerian Policeman or the Nigerian Soldier because, for them, the liberty to swing their fists ends wherever the fists end. Full stop.
Nigerians
have absolute freedom — as long as they are lucky to make it into the armed
forces or into the top cadres of politics. For the unfortunate ones who are
neither calling the shots nor firing them, well, their rights have to be
limited to create room for the gods to thrive. Fundamental Human Rights are
very much like energy: they can neither be created nor destroyed but can only
be transferred from one person to another. As with everything else under the
sky, there is hardly enough to go round.
To
cut the long story short, the result of this arrangement is that people die —
extrajudicially. How, you ask?
As a policeman, for example, you could be going about your normal duty, dutifully serving your fatherland as you tax road users for all the good things the country has done for them. And then one stubborn man, thinking he knows the law better than you, refuses to part with his money. I mean, how more unpatriotic could a person be? On top that, the rebel has the audacity to have all his vehicle papers complete and updated! Does he have two heads? Imagine how much such an experience would boil your blood, and already you have been roasting under the sun like chicken suya for several hours. The little gin dancingtesumolein your bloodstream is also not helping matters and you are left with no choice but to teach Mr Lawyer here a lesson he would never forget — and maybe also one he would never remember. The highway is safer without people like him causing traffic congestion anyway.
As a gallant member of the Nigerian Army who is not busy fending off insurgents in the Northeast, you often have to put up with ‘em bloody civilians every now and then. Just imagine one small boy standing shoulder to shoulder with you and looking you in the eyeball as he addresses you. Is it because he has what look like six packs? Does he know how much you have sacrificed for this country? Does he know you were aconfam agberoin Lagos before poverty pushed you to join the army? Is he not seeing, hanging majestically under your armpit, your shiny AK-47 rifle newly imported from Russia and thirsting for its first blood? Yet, he dares look you in the eye. Yet, he dares maintain a shred of dignity while rolling in the mud and doing frog jump? Such treason must not be allowed to go unpunished. Even your colleagues will not be pleased with you later at the bar that evening if you don’t deposit some bullets in the fellow’s body.
But then, even though you are gods with veto power over who lives or dies, you must understand that all gods are equal but some are more equal than others. Your superiors in divinity may be forced to take actions against you in order to prolong their god-hood. You must avoid this scenario as best as you can, great one. Here’s how.
Even
though the whole of Nigeria is your turf to do however you please, you have to
understand it is easier to get away with (extrajudicial) murder in certain
places, namely highways, bushes, rural communities, dark alleys, police stations,
and so on. That way, you can chop (off a person’s head) and clean mouth without
ever fearing that you might lose your privilege to less-deserving people.
What to do with the body? Just take it to a nearby cemetery or find some remote area, dig up a self-containment for it in the soil, and check it into its eternal resting place. If the family members are rich enough to have internet access, photos of thevictim(do not mind the word choice) will be circulated on social media. After a few days or weeks of running from the pillar of one police station to the post of another, they will finally accept their fate. You might even see the photo shared by one of your contacts on WhatsApp stories. “This bastard even has people who love him,” you would chuckle and scroll on in search of more videos of fine, twerking girls.
If you had no choice but to summarily sentence a person to death where there are other civilians, make sure you leave no witnesses who would cause trouble. Be particularly wary of people holding their phones above their waist; they are the messengers of Instablog and Minister Tunde Ednut who have been sent to put you to shame. Get that phone and smash it. Then throw a dice in your head on whether the phone owner’s head should suffer the same fate.
When you think of tying the loose ends, whatever image comes to your mind is what you should do. You might have to liberate more bullets in the direction of the witnesses but, not to worry, all is fair in love and war. Collateral damage is part of life. Nigerian life, especially.
Okay, it is possible that you are not able to take care of all the eyes and lenses that might have witnessed you “playing God”. The game is not over, gallant one. At this point, what you want to do is paint the deceased indevil red. If possible, attach a set of horns to his head for effect.
You know what they say about giving a dog a bad name to hang it? Only this time, you are giving it a bad name to avoid being hanged yourself. Let the world know immediately that the victim was a suspected terrorist or armed robber or cultist based on watertight intelligence. You have to use heavy words from the Criminal Code; nothing else would do. You cannot say for instance that he offered to bribe you with N50 instead of N200.
Before
you know it, patriotic Nigerians on the internet would come to your defencepro
bono(without getting paid one kobo).
There
is no better way to get the wolves of social media off your back than the
assurance that the army or police is “on top of the situation”, “has arrested
the (nameless) perpetrator”, and is “conducting investigations”. You all know,
of course, that the investigation does not extend beyond the one-paragraph
press statement from the media and propaganda department.
If some nosy journalist calls to ask weeks later for updates about the investigation, simply ignore them or say, “investigations are still ongoing as we want to leave no stone unturned in the interest of justice”.
We have to admit, there are rare times when the police or Nigerian Army needs a scapegoat — though, in this case, not to deter bad behaviour but to play a fast one on the public. The punishment usually ranges from a warning from your superior to getting transferred to another location where the people will not be quick to recognise you and where you can start afresh (with plenty of fresh blood). Life goes on, my friend.
If all the previous tricks do not work, there is one final thing you can do to get away with (extrajudicial) murder as a Nigerian demigod: Find another unfortunate person to kill. Yes, you read that correctly. In this country, there is no better way to quench the fire of a scandal than with the fire of a bigger scandal (—or giveaways, but that is talk for another day).
It is not every time you will have to go to that length though since there are other ways to make front-page news as well. Allegations of corruption. Appointments of people from a particular ethnic group into a top office. An entertainment celebrity’s baby mama finally putting to bed. Just name it. Pick one, get it to the press at a strategic time, and watch your old sins wash away like makeup on a rainy day.
God
bless Nigeria and long live the Nigerian gods."
The Nigerian dream,https://punocracy.com/the-nigerian-dream/,2020-05-28T08:37:53+01:00,"By: Raheem Gbolahan Hammed
When I was in the States (haters will say it’s Ogun state) in my previous life, of course, everybody’s first dream was that God should bless America. The reverse is the case in the most populous country in Africa. Makes me wonder what exactly is wrong with you people.
I know some of you would want to ask what my dreams were when I was a citizen of the states. Well, to adequately contribute my quota towards the growth and development of my immediate society and the country at large. This was achieved through membership of some non-governmental organizations, political parties with people-centred manifestos, pressure groups, and so on. I felt if we can have a saner clime, everyone would be able to maximize his or her potentials.
Unlike ‘the abroad’, the Nigerian dream is extremely different and sweet.
First, you must build a house of your own. While it is largely normal to rent an apartment all your life over there and live with your family. Here, you are not a Nigerian if you did not buy your land, build house and, oftentimes, face thewahalaofomo onile(if your god wants to fuck with you). But if you are a soldier, all you need to do is write‘military zone, keep off’. You have achieved one of your Nigerian dreams. If you are the type who inherits a house, I am sorry, a larger part of the unwritten Nigerian Dream constitution does not give you a good rating on the house score card. Build your house!Na naija man you be.
If you intend to have one child, I am sorry to announce that you are falling short of the Nigerian dream. Or tell me, who are you planning to emulate in your family? Now, change that orientation, you must have at least three children: Doctor, Engineer and Lawyer. Besides, the advantages of having more than three far outweigh having less. SARS might kill one or two for dressing too fine in Lagos, remember? Kidnappers might abduct and kill one or two if they are in the north. And there’s the killer herdsmen, Boko Haram terrorists, and so on. I hope you get what I’m trying to tell you now? You are a Nigerian! Keep the Nigerian dream.
It is a Nigerian dream to send your children tothe abroadfor different purposes. But keep in mind that such children must send money back home so that you can boast among your colleagues in church or social events that, ‘Ah, Tunde, that my doctor-son in the UK sent money last week, I need to go and collect it now.’ And please, abroad is abroad. Be it Italy, China, or Lebanon. As long as they are sending money back home, you are doing well with your Nigerian dream.
At this point, I must tell you to add to your Nigerian dream, how to be a politician. In fact. If you can achieve this, you are made for life. You can order the detention of anyone who ‘harasses’ you online, you can steal billions of naira meant for pension and get a bail to pay a few thousand.
You remain untouchable even when bullion vans are brought in to your house on the eve of election. You remain untouchable even with about 64 accounts and outrageous scandals against you. You can be a senator collecting your salaries and allowances while you serve a jail term (and they work on upturning the judgment). You can be seen keeping ill-gotten dollars in your babariga and nothing happens. You can silence a critic in your state and nobody dares question you. You can hold an important position in the Senate even after stealing its mace a few years earlier. Should I go on?
I know you might be tempted to ask where the position of thugs are. Thugs are upcoming politicians. If you want to get to the politician level in Nigeria, you must start off as a thug. If you are well known, and you hold a strong base, rest assured you are a good asset for the next gubernatorial election; you could even own a university abroad. Just keep your head straight and remain focused.
While it is very beautiful to become a Medical Doctor, a Nurse, a Teacher, an Engineer and so on, it should not deter you from achieving the greater goal of being a terrorist (please repent afterwards, you have huge benefits waiting for you), thug (you are certain you could own a university and have great IGR), and finally a politician (you are made for life, your children and great grandchildren too; you could even help the nation years after death and they would name so many places after you).
See you at the top."
Exploits of the legendary John Wike,https://punocracy.com/exploits-of-the-legendary-john-wike/,2020-05-26T08:38:36+01:00,"By: Ibrahim Williams
May this topic be
unsurprising. Amen.
In the honorable name
of a living legend who since forever has been known as a national hero in our
great country, I greet you all.
I want to assume we are all contemporaries. Not in terms of age of course, but in our experience and lives as fellow Nigerians who for some months have now been seated at home watching or streaming or listening to the tales of the tremendous battle our valiant leaders are fighting for us.
This battle, as we all know, has claimed the lives of millions of human beings worldwide, with Nigeria painstakingly contributing an impoverished amount to this quota. Glory be to God for that. Without further ado, we are gathered here today to appreciate the selfless, patriotic, compassionate, and exemplary leadership that our Governor, John Wike, has shown in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
I must serve a note of warning that though the name John Wike sounds like to a movie character, it is in fact not. This is because, unlike John Wick, John Wike is only after physical properties, not blood, not revenge, and for that reason it behooves us to learn the proper difference between the pronunciation of Wick and Wike.
That said, it is my pleasure to announce to you that, the nominal title,The Legendwhich is affixed to our governor’s name is novel, yet, by no means a mistake. It came after a careful deliberation of our governor’s numerous heroic acts for the Eastern branch of The Chartered Institute for Legendary Affairs (CHILA) to ascribe himA Legend— after they found him worthy in learning and character.
This is a man who took it upon himself to relieve his law enforcement agencies of their duty so that he could monitor the compliance of the people of Rivers state to his stay-at-home orders. This is a man who abandoned the coveted pleasure of his home and family to embrace the cold heat of the PH streets just so he could flank down people to say, “Hi, how Corona be for your side?”
Such are his acts of selflessness that he dressed in a piece of shirt and trouser to plead with people to alight from their cars so he could help them auction it. Such is John Wike, the man of the people who could tell that they were tired of the cars in the first place, and needed it confiscated. He is the only man who cares so much about his people. TheBaba Yaga,the lovingBabaof Rivers state.
Just the other day, John Wike attained another feat. He relieved the crying foundation of a building by wrapping it in the dusty embrace of an executive order, and a crane. A building owned by a tax-paying citizen of the state, but, who cares?
You might hear, unfortunately, the rumored version of this, and that is that the building was for recreation, lodging people, and feeding them for commercial purposes. But that’s all lies. The kind governor would never engage in such abomination asgoing Abachaon people’s sweat and properties. It was the foundation of a building, and the foundation no longer cries. Besides if Wike did it, it has to be the right thing to do.
As it stands now, the people of the Rivers state are swimming in happiness. There is no fear in the land whatsoever. Everyone is well quarantined in their homes, including those hungry without homes, and without palliatives. This is the man of the people; the man standing by the people; and the man for the people. At this juncture, we shall leave it at this, while we await the booty from the car auctions as well as more legendary exploits from our very ownBaba Yaga.
Ciao."
How to be a Nigerian woman,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-nigerian-woman/,2020-05-26T08:26:18+01:00,"By: Edaki Timothy
First off, I must thank you because you have decided to learn a few tricks about being a woman. Most Nigerian women are often loathe to topics such as this. Conversations that teach them how to be better are often met with disgust and a strong detest. They refuse to listen to the voice of reason and sound opinion, well, except you’re their father in the Lord or spiritual leader, as the case my be.
With social media becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, it is not uncommon to find women leaving their husbands in search of happiness — such a sad and disturbing move really. In this article, you’ll find all the answers you need as a woman to stay happy, the guideline to handling men, and every other panacea you seek to questions that arise about being a Nigerian woman.
When that man says he likes you and wants something more serious and intimate with you, do not be deceived — men are scum. He is a liar created by the devil and is only trying to sway you with those stupid poetic proclamations of love. These Nigerian men only see the space between your thighs, don’t be fooled.
First off, you must do smallshakaraeven if you like him. It is very necessary. Tell him you’ll think about it. Don’t rush into nodding your head like an agama lizard. Don’t give him a response until after three weeks. You need to be certain he is very serious.
When and if you eventually agree, you must
wreck him dry. He is your new ATM; never out of cash. Always dispensing. He
must foot all your bills, after all did you beg him to ask you to be his? He
must pay your school fees, book you first class flights, even if your mother
has never smelt the inside of an Uber taxi. He must stock up your fridge and
even give you money to make your hair.
Remember also that your mother barely has
two coins to rub together, and she’s married to your father who cannot even buy
lace for his shoes, so he uses the thread from the worn-out rug in the sitting
room. Remember that your father has warned you never to bring a poor man home.
So, you must realize that relationships are not one nonsensical romantic affair
as they portray in those Tarantino movies. As a Nigerian woman, relationships
for you are business ventures.
P.S: I have refrained from saying boys, because boys are poor idiots. Boys are undergraduates, fresh graduates,corpers. They have nothing in currency to offer. Avoid them.
So, that young man has asked you out on a date. Unimportant things are you being concerned about your dress and make-up (although you should look good). Your major focus should be calling your friends and asking them if they will accompany you to the date. Make sure you let the date fall between the hours of 7pm – 10pm so your friends can be free of their daily engagements. Once the time is settled, get your clique to follow you to the date, because who doesn’t like free food!
Be less concerned if the young man you’re going to meet is a corper who has not been paid hisallawee. Once there, order more than you can eat. Encourage your friends to do the same and have some to takeaway. A true Nigerian woman knows that dates are a good place to get free food, not to know you better or anything of such.
A true Nigerian woman knows that her stance on feminism must be warped and inconceivably hard to decipher. We all know that men are scum and are never up to any good, feminism is your weapon to fight this. For example, when there is an argument about who’s better between Wizkid and Olamide on Twitter, write that all this shows is how male-dominated the industry is, and how women are never given a leeway to push their craft, even though the argument about who is better between Tiwa Savage and Simi is trending.
Tweet about how horny you are and wouldn’t mind fucking your gateman’s 18-year-old son but let all hell loose about a 30 year old man dating a 22 years old girl. Why? She’s too young. It is rape! Yes, we love the double standards.
Tell your students and listeners that you
do not care about your husband’s opinion and you’re an independent woman, but
beg him to let you sleep on the bed and not on the kitchen floor. Tweet that
feminism and gender equality but refuse to drop your purse for family upkeep.
You live in a man’s world. Why should you have to give part of your money to
run your home? Men are scum indeed!
I’ll let you digest this info. for now.

Buhari’s govt makes history with record number of virtual meetings — APC,https://punocracy.com/buharis-makes-history-with-virtual-meetings-apc/,2020-05-22T07:07:52+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Nigeria’s ruling party, the Anti-Progressive Congress (APC), has commended the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari for making history with its recent embrace of “groundbreaking technology”.
Lanre Olinu, the party’s national publicity secretary, during a press briefing on Friday observed that no other government has held as many virtual meetings during such a short period.
“It shows that even during a global health crisis, the government is taking information and communication technology seriously and is paving the way to a more digitally connected economy for all Nigerians,” Olinu said.
“No other president has used such advanced technology before, not even the man from Ogun state who still writes letters on paper instead of just sending emails. It is almost like witchcraft, except it is science and Nigeria is one of few countries in the world to put it to use at such high levels of governance,” the party spokesman added.
“No doubt, if we continue with this trend, by 2050, Nigeria will have made its first webcam or maybe even started mass producing USB cables. Nothing is impossible with the APC in power.”
What he was asked what the ruling party thinks about the use of robots in Rwanda that can screen up to 150 people in a minute, Olinu replied that the step is small compared to technological advances in Nigeria.
“Let us not forget the legendary app launched by the APC government in Kogi state,” he said with a broad smile. “As we speak, they have still not confirmed a single case of COVID-19.”
Meanwhile, The T.A. Report gathered that President Buhari has decided to be conducting all non-international visits on Zoom subsequently after discovering how “powerful” the app is.
“Whenever there are Boko Haram attacks in Borno, for example, or tank explosions in Lagos, instead of going physically or having the governor bring pictures to the statehouse, the president will just speak to the state leaders and victims via video call,” a source hinted.
“Isn’t it wonderful?”

"Soldiers who complain will henceforth have their heads examined, says Nigerian Army",https://punocracy.com/soldiers-who-complain-will-have-their-heads-examined/,2020-05-22T07:02:14+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― The Nigerian Army has announced that soldiers who lament about working conditions in the course of fighting terrorism and banditry will henceforth be subjected to mental health screening and counselling.
It said in apress statement, obtained by The T.A. Report and reinterpreted here, that unpatriotic and uncomplimentary remarks from army officials are nothing but signs of “mental snap and distress occasioned by the fog of war”.
“Because we have the interest of our gallant soldiers at heart, we cannot stand by and watch their mental health deteriorate as a result of the stress and trauma that accompanies war efforts,” said Tukur Burantashi, the Chief of Army Staff.
“It is unheard of that, after years of training in discipline, self-restraint, self-sacrifice, and blind following, officials of the army will still speak against the army leadership. There can be no explanation for such irrational behaviour other than delirium and potential mental disorder.”
Burantashi added that his jaws nearly fell off when he saw a video circulating on social media where soldiers, instead of trending#ThankYouBuratai, were busy laying curses on him like they were medals.
“What else do they want?” he asked.
“We have already empowered them with contemporary skills in spiritual warfare. We pray for them on a weekly basis. We also allow them to vent their anger and frustration on civilians as they please. Is it until we give them state-of-the-art equipment, provide standard incentives, and follow them to the battleground that they know our hearts are with them? Let’s be reasonable, please.”
This paper gathered that the Nigerian Army’s new tactic was received with cheers and admiration at the presidency, which is now considering replicating it in other sectors.
“The president thinks it is insane for any Nigerian not to be pleased with the gifts he has been giving them in the form of palliatives, bridges, some electricity, and free food,” one source close to the restructured kitchen cabinet told our correspondent.
“Just like drunk drivers, those who expressly complain after all the federal government has been doing may soon have to go through compulsory health checks. We can’t have mentally ill people roaming the streets of this sane country.”

‘Have your President call my President’ | Sonala Olumhense,https://punocracy.com/have-your-president-call-my-president/,2020-05-22T06:55:28+01:00,"Hello, Excellency!”
“Hello Mr. President. It is always so good to hear that: Excellency.  It is wonderful. People like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, they never call me that.”
“It is not a problem, Excellency. I know you are very busy, Excellency. They said you wanted me to call you?”
“Oh really, who? You know we are so busy with the COVID-19 pandemic here.”
“Of course, Excellency. You know I am working from home these days. So I watch everything onCNN.”
“You watch the Fake News?  No, you should be watching Fox News.  I work from home too; I call it ‘Watching from home.’  So much fun like you wouldn’t believe.”
“Sorry about the loss of so many American lives, Excellency, almost 60,000.”
“Yes, thank you. It could have been much more, but we are doing a tremendous job all over the country.  Mine is a very effective leadership.  But how are you doing? They were telling me you have a major problem in Cano.”
“Oh, Kano. Yes. But it was just a misunderstanding. We have it under control.  All we need now are ventilators.”
“Ventilators. Oh yes. Those are in very high demand all over the world.  Everyone wants them. I had to tell our governors to fend for themselves. But we have enough now in our stockpile, and I am expecting a lot more.  We will be helping Italy, France and Spain.”
“Your Excellency, you must also help Nigeria. We are a good friend of the US.  We will do anything you ask, Excellency.”
“Anything I ask? I like the sound of that. I remember that when you visited me two years ago, I requested fairness and reciprocity in our relations. We give Nigeria annual aid of over $1bn, but you have huge trade barriers preventing US businesses from investing there.”
“Trade barriers, Excellency?   If any, we will dismantle them without delay.  We want US investment.”
“I could actually authorise the ventilators today, but they are in such demand.”
“Excellency, we beg of you.  Elon Must refused to give us 500. Please just 100 or 200.”
“You think that would be enough?”
“More than enough, walahi, Excellency!”
“But you have a population of 200 million.”
“Yes Excellency, but we have no hospitals to place them.  I use foreign hospitals myself. No problem”
“So you may have a distribution problem then.”
“Not at all. I will give three each to some states, one in some cases, and none to some states at all, and I will keep the rest here at the presidency.  More than enough.”
“Why one in some states and zero in others?”
“Oh Excellency, the PDP states are those that will get one, out of my generosity, because they are the ones that didn’t build hospitals or buy ventilators.  Those that get zero are those that didn’t vote for us.”
“Oh, the Democrats!”
“No, Excellency, we are the Democrats, the Progressives.”
“But aren’t they PDP…the Democrats? Anyhow, you can save a lot of money and buy a lot of ventilators if you want. I mean, you are getting back $321m of Sani Abacha’s looted funds from us. If you resist the temptation to give part of that to a state governor, you could really do a lot.”
“But Excellency…”
“And there are records of all these former governors and ministers and senators who are double and triple-dipping or fleecing their states under terrible pension laws, some of them dating as far back as 18 or 19 years.”
“Those are just rumours, Excellency. Many of them are our friends, and they have told us they never did any such thing. It is just like Sani Abacha; he never looted anyone, that is just a name. But believe me, if you send us the ventilators, we will soon be curving the flat all over Nigeria.”
“You mean, flattening the curve. I will see about the ventilators, but they may not be available for three or four or five months or end of the year.  Some of these things are not easy.  Remember the 12 A29 Tucano jets you overpaid for?  I know you were hoping to get them by 2020, but that will not happen before 2023. You may more quickly receive the 12 Mi-35 helicopters you signed with Russia in October last year.”
“Thank you, Excellency. I will have my ambassador follow-up on the ventilators. Maybe we will be lucky.”
“Ambassador? You mean you have an ambassador here in Washington, DC?”
“Emm Excellency. Do you mean you have not seen him?  I will check. I remember nominating one old man…twice. I remember this because he was even older than me. That is one of the reasons we really need these ventilators. Otherwise, we will never deepen the curve.”
“Flatten the curve, you mean. But are you aggressively testing? Your numbers seem so low!”
“Oh yes Excellency, we are testing. We test everyone who looks suspicious.  We just don’t want to waste test kits.”
“That is rather interesting. I hadn’t thought of that. But in the US I am doing a fantastic job.  We are testing better than anybody on earth and we have tests like you wouldn’t believe. But what do you intend to do about power?”
“Power? No problem, Excellency. I am quite strong.  I can race anyone.”
“No, not your muscles. Electricity. Ventilators are very sensitive equipment.  Fluctuating power can easily damage them. How will you power them?”
“Oh, electricity? Walahi only some people have that problem.  In Aso Rock we have generators. Then backup generators to backup the generators. We even have backup generators to backup the generators which backup NEPA.”
“NEPA?”
“Sorry, Excellency. NEPA is what we call public power supply. My children told me the company now has a new name. But don’t you worry, we will get it right. We will even get EFCC to count the generators every night.  They will not disappear like loot from the Abacha years.”
“That is reassuring. But you know, your country could have really benefitted from that ‘Power Up Africa’ Obama was pursuing. But I am told your country never showed interest.”
‘Power Up Africa’? I am sure it was PDP who blocked it. APC is NEXT LEVEL performance. No problem.”
“What about maintenance?”
“Maintenance? We don’t worry about that.  We always buy new ones, whether jets, cars or generators, and throw away the old.”
“No, I mean maintenance of the ventilators. These are very sophisticated equipment. Like a car…very high-quality. Many doctors and nurses have never seen it before. If people are learning on the job to use them, people die.”
“Dying, Excellency? Nobody dies in Aso Rock!”
“’Excellency.’ Music to my ears. But with no oil being sold, no planting being done, no trading in the land, and little importation likely, what about that thundering hunger and anger?”
“That is okay, Mr. President.  This place is protected by hundreds of soldiers and hundreds of policemen.”
“Sounds like a plan!  You got your ventilators!!”

Arresting poetry for a better Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/arresting-poetry-for-a-better-nigeria/,2020-05-20T10:13:57+01:00,"First, some background: Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has ordered the arrest and detention of a journalist, Rotimi Jolayemi also known as Oba Akewi, over a poem read during a radio programme the minister considers critical of him.{Sahara Reporters, May 18, 2020.}
It is with great honour that I commit myself to identify how responsible, patriotic and committed Nigerian leaders are. They daily prove to be saviours and messiahs, sacrificing everything for the betterment of the nation.
To learn of true leadership, commitment, patriotism and veritable governance, it is important to observe the affairs and activities of our leaders.
It is in this light we have to identify one of the efforts made to maintain sanity in our nation as a way of learning from the best and most exemplary among us.
One major way to restore sanity is to expunge all truth revealing strategies. As art plays a major role in doing that, it is important to ARREST THE ART!
Our leaders are very sensitive and proactive and this is why one of them took the bold step to detain poetry: a medium of social criticism towards growth, awareness, and development. The wise man, seeing the prospect of poetry’s anti-sanity qualities, also detained its family members. This well-meaning leader says “Lai-Lai! Poetry is a threat” acted fast to serve his nation. Kudos to him!
Poetry is a threat indeed; it is capable of stirring change, but the time ofchangehas passed. We are in thenext level. Poetry is capable of giving voice to the deprived, and that is not what we ought to see in our nation. Sanity is endurance, silence,shuffering and shmiling, injustice and ineffectiveness, and this is what our leaders are committed to ensuring.
So let us thank our leader for arresting poetry; that resilient, recalcitrant noisemaker who thinks he can destabilise the seeming peace of the nation with his lines of rash truth.
To further ensure the safety of Nigerians, that safety that dwells in ignorance, this well-meaning leader, in order to arrest poetry, first detained his wife. Such a commitment should earn our precious leader a medal of honour for a job well done.
Nowhere is safer than our dear nation, no government official serves her citizens better than those of Nigeria.
So to be a good citizen, wherever you find poetry being aired or performed, be it on a stage or during a radio programme, arrest him! You would have served your fatherland well."
The noble efforts to give almajiris a bright future,https://punocracy.com/noble-efforts-give-almajiris-bright-future/,2020-05-19T09:50:09+01:00,"By: Sultan Quadri
“Almajirai, sorry Almajiri!” I screamed with excitement. I have never seen someone with a better future. They are being encamped in a repository of knowledge and are contributing to the growth of the country. Ultimately, they make our own burdens lighter. They are a beauty to behold, even their wise masters will sit at meat with them, crack jokes, and tell them stories. These are some of the many luxuries they enjoy that we don’t.
For example, they don’t have to wake up with their lungs filled with dust, friendly insects feasting incessantly on their bodies. They wake up hurriedly so that they can eat the food they didn’t get a fill of yesterday. In the ever pleasant morning, they are asked what they want to eat, they smile and grumble that they want a new meal and their requests are granted.
Even if they see a ray of hope or interest in something as Haram as Makarantan Boko, a thunder of “infidel” and soothing lashes of loving whips will never touch their backs. What do you need western education for? Without it, the commissioner rose to the top. He loitered the street, begged for money from passersby, almost got ran over by cars daily, ate crumbs from the plate of strangers and, when it was time, he was handpicked from the street and was sworn in as a commissioner the next day. You don’t have to strive; striving is rebellion.
When you see your master’s children wearing what looks like something they wear in somewhere they call school, run to your loving master, ask why you find it confusing, and he will allow you drink from the river of his flowing wisdom. Well, that is if your master’s family are not kept far away from beastly animals and the preying eyes of bad belles. Who doesn’t like unpaid labor? Even the illustrious King Pharaoh was not stupid enough to let go of the lazy Egyptians that did nothing but eating his food. He didn’t even force them to build Pithom and Ramesses.
The Almajiris go to your small farm when they are bored and need something to while away time. The farm is not even productive and it doesn’t even add a cent to your wealth. God forbid you to reap unjustly from the wealth of others. Put them in their places, use the sweetness of Al-janna, and the terror of Al-jahim to make them understand why they can’t be empowered to contribute to this good-for-nothing country. They don’t need to even dream of having anything here; it’s vanity upon vanity.
No wonder they long for the afterlife so much that they believe death is actually doing them a favor. A life well spent; the more the suffering on earth the more the reward in the afterlife. Your friends and families will envy you, you will drive a Maybach. Dubai is so dirty, seasoned with the endearing smell of undiluted urine, trash beautifies the road and once in a while dust re-energizes their lungs. Empty heads filled with mischievous agendas are saluted and given references until they become Islamic Scholars.
Dubai is backward, they will never allow infidels to corrupt them with western education and they will never evolve. The boys of popular scholars go to the farm with golden hoes, why will they ever use a tractor that was invented with western knowledge?
Alas, O, ye patriot! If only what a ruler is good for in Nigeria is not to measure the percentage of the treasury to be looted. Yes! So, you think they don’t know about percentages? How do you think they brilliantly share monies received from well-meaning and law-abiding citizens that just want to show appreciation for their good works?
In truth, the rulers are really zealous. They got into office to work, take Almajiris off the streets, build roads even when the world is building runways and railroads, et cetera. That is how much he intended to do.  “Let’s give him air to breathe,” defacto state coordinators concluded. They made sure they didn’t contaminate the air around the ruler with any foul idea or logical resolution. “But seriously, did the Almajiris complain to you?” he was strategically advised.
It is easy to throw election promises off the ship here, just tell them, you tried but it was an effort in futility. Don’t worry, they will elect you for the second time to really focus on the task ahead. Conspiracies are forbidden is this clime. You cannot conspire with a gang leader to burn the mosque of rivals or harbour criminals. You mustn’t kill off the dreams of promising Nigerians. They are not even worth it even if you decide to consider that filthy agenda. And yes, your friends from the south are evil. Especially those two big tribes, they are always conspiring against you. But do you think they have your time? They are trying to get far away from you. Biafra is the way and the Oduduwa Republic is the path.
That Lord Luggard ehn! He didn’t do well for us o. It seems I’m already digressing, but not in the way we prefer to reduce our expenditure on capital assets than cancelling something as integral to national development as renovating the national assembly. It is a place of honor. Sorry, I have digressed again. Maybe it is the ways of Nigeria that is affecting me, official modus operandi: An upside-down priority list. I will love to come back to the southerners; they didn’t care until the shipping of Almajiris began to pay visits to their territory."
How to satirise religion in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-satirise-religion-in-nigeria/,2020-05-17T11:59:57+01:00,"Are
you one of those funny people who like making others laugh as you mock a part
of the society they don’t belong to? Do you take pleasure in exaggerating the country’s
flaws to draw attention to them or stating them exactly as they are (because Nigeria
is already nothing but 923,000km2of pure hyperbole) with surprisingly
similar effects? Do you often wonder if half of your readers are smart enough
to get your message written as it may be in English language? Then, dear
satirist, this article is for you.
My
sermon for you today is simple: Never attempt to bring religion into your art. The
day you treat religion (and by that I mean any of Nigeria’s two major religions
and their subsets) with half of the scorn with which you treat politics or
other themes, that is the day you risk everything: your job, your audience, or
even your life if you wrong the wrong people wrongfully enough.
But, as we happen to share a lot in common, I know you are stubborn. You like forbidden fruits and care little for your well-being. If the society had a reset button, you would be first to hit it. You see the humour in the darkest of tragedies or most serious of topics and can’t wait to share the joke with others.
Anyway,
if you must write a satire about religion or anything and anyone directly
connected to it as a devout believer or prominent promoter, then for your own
good pay attention to the tips I am about to share.
If
you would normally use 70 per cent of your satirical superpowers, then you must
drink the Wakanda potion that makes people weaker. Forget the Black Panther. To
satirise religion and live to satirise another day, you have to take the form
of the Black Painter—writing what you mean (as a satirist would) but covering
it in layers of emulsion paint that make it almost unrecognisable.
If, ordinarily, you would be inclined to write a “strongly-worded” piece of five or more pages, you can reduce it to half a page. Better still, you can ramble on the topic in the first four and a half pages before finally hitting the nail on the head with two to three paragraphs. Your message might get lost in translation, but then isn’t that better than you getting lost in transit?
If you must attack a religious leader, go for those who are not yet in the mainstream—because even though they might claim to have been called, they are probably lying if they don’t have the millions of following and tens of megachurches or mosques to support it. God does not call a person who cannot convert the conversation to a conference call. And you know it is easier to condemn a person whom the society does not hold in high regards to start with.
Remember,
God anoints but man appoints. “Touch not my anointed (unless they have yet to
obtain their certificate of anointment from the court of public opinion),” says
the Lord.
At the end of the day, most clerics share a lot in common. The actions of one are representative of the instincts of the others.
All
fruits, no matter how lowly they hang, still have their own seeds, so you must
be ready to be called out and maybe even cancelled by thesubjects of your subject.
You can never be fully insulated from attacks (in the physical, online, or even
spiritual realm), so never let your guard down. “Constructive criticism” does
not exist in the Encyclopaedia of Religion. Unlike in the United Nations, you
are either a member or you are not. There is no room for (unbiased) observers.
Clarity and satire are not always on good terms, I know. But in this instance, you have to be even more unintelligible. Be hidden in broad daylight. Be unpredictable. Be as confusing as the gender spectrum in the contemporary world. You can start by using a fake name for your subject. If the cleric’s name, for example, is Indiana Baba-Hossana, you can change it to something as alien as Indabosky Bahose. You can better fortify yourself with an unrelatable feature image and a disclaimer reassuring Doubting Thomases that all characters are sourced from no other place but the figment of your wild imagination.
If your article ends up triggering the wrong nerves, believe me, you don’t want to be caught in the Aso Rock of a religious storm. Separate your art from yourself, except of course you have self-destructive tendencies and want to be remembered as the disbelieving writer who became a scapegoat for challenging Clerical Napoleons who, of course, are always right. Or except you are privileged to be writing fromthe abroadwhere freedom of expression is not just a paragraph under the section on freedom of religion.
So,
learn from George Orwell and use a pseudonym. There’s still plenty of room in
Kano prisons for hard-headed lots like you who delight in blaspheming against
God and his earthly reflections. And that’s if you’re lucky enough to make it
to the court."
With love from a Nigerian: Open letter to Buhari’s new Chief of Staff,https://punocracy.com/open-letter-to-buharis-new-chief-of-staff/,2020-05-17T11:48:46+01:00,"Dear Sir,
Being the sharpshooter (that misses most times), that I am, I like to (and would) hit my target without much ado. I listened with rapt attention as my Short Wave transistor spouted out news of your appointment as the new Chief of Staff of a regime that is regarded as the best thing to have happened to Nigeria since the divinely sanctioned coup that ousted the much-beloved frugal emperor of Nigeria from Kano.
It is under this regime that Nigerians stopped shouting “Up NEPA” on every occasion that electricity is restored to homes because Uninterrupted Power Supply with the aid of generators is now the real deal. Nigeria moved from being the world’s poverty capital to a country where people can no longer spellp o v e r t yas they’ve become unable to conceptualise what it means to be poor.
I need not tell you that this country is the highest ranking financial donor in the world. USA, China, Germany, UK,et alare now at the mercy of the alms our benevolent arms can extend to them. We enjoy a paradise-like tranquility even though once in a while remnants of the technically defeatedBoko Haramuse our people for their killing-practice.
The world’s number one democracy has sent its brightest minds to learn our widely acclaimed“Art of Governance: Naija Model”.  As it is now, America-first trumpeting Trump is learning democracy, good governance, infrastructural development, poverty alleviation, and protection of human rights from us.
I wish I could
congratulate you but my admirable immaculate conscience that is sometimes tinted
with hues of vices – vices of hatred for politicians and self-made
millionaires, laziness and jealousy, bigotry and intolerance,  alcoholism and drug-abuse, bribery and
corruption, and so on – won’t just let me. So, in place of “congratulations”,
permit me totualeyou with seventy-five rugged “wehdon(s) sah!”
Just so it sinks, I
like to articulate, albeit very briefly, the feather-weight yoke of the office
that you have burdened yourself with. By virtue of your new office sir, you are
thede factoPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria – a country
that is too big and too populated to be governed by one president, be he a
retired Nigerian Army General and former Head of State.
By virtue of your appointment, you are also the Indabsoki Bahose of the cabal that makes a puppet of the president and accounts solely for the unprecedented progresses that are now dotting the developmental landscape of our national life. You know too well that your revered and esteemed principal – so esteemed that the masses ushered him to power with a utility bill instead of the basic academic qualification – is God-sent and infallible in the eyes of the masses. Like Abba Kyari, you have to shoulder the blame for your principal’s perceivedef-upsin governance.
As the new Chief of
Staff, you must uphold the legacy of your predecessor. Your predecessor was the
doorkeeper of the president and was able to exhibit his expertise as a
grandmaster in Monopoly, by monopolising access to His Excellency. His legendary
feat was so great that he got His Excellency to relegate Her Excellency to the
kitchen andza ozarooms of the villa.
I must, in words that are clear as crystal, warn you not to decline any overt transfer of power to you by Mr President, whenever he wants to embark on one of his endless foreign trips that underscore his foreign policy. We do know that in the spiritual realm, the office of the Vice President was abolished during the rancour between Baba Iyabo and his number two (and as it was then, so has it been ever since and so shall it continue to be). What we have is a silhouette of that office. I also need not tell you that the spiritual supersedes the temporal. Besides, what can a non-northerner bring to the table that can aid Nigeria’s development? I hear the Yorubas have joined the Igbos in clamouring for secession. Don’t let them clog the wheel of the smooth-running of this country.
So, aside from being
the de facto president, you are the de facto VP and primus to all ministers in
His Excellency’s cabinet. Like Jesus, you are the conduit of their
supplications and entreaties to the president and so shall you remain. May it
not be said that it was in your time that the president died as a result of
being overwhelmed by his official functions.
If you will not pay heed to all I have written
so far, for your sake and that of your posterity, I implore you to take to
heart all that I am about to say now.
Power is the principal thing in life. In all your acquisitions, acquire power by either hook or crook. Disregard those misguided and misinformed political scientists who claim power possesses some corrosive elements. The more power you have, the more divine you become. Death will keep a distance from you. Even if your acquired powers are not able to transform you to a god, rest assured that, at your death, Nigerians will polish you and canonise you a saint – martyred by the great corruption that is Nigeria.
Ensure that your
principal does not take the right step in solving the problems besetting the
country. After all, are Nigerians not corrupt? Corruption is wickedness. Did
the Holy Writ not state that the wicked will not thrive in the land?
According to the BBC (Beer-parlour Broadcasting Corporation), Nigeria ranked #1 in terms of corruption and insecurity under Jones Arogbofa. The same source revealed that we became the World’s Poverty Capital under Abba Kyari. It is my prayer that you soar above the enviable efforts of your predecessors.
Rumours have it that
you have started on a very hot note, long may your chimney continue to smoke.
Once again,wehdone sah!
I thank you, most
sincerely, for taking out time from your busy schedules to read this letter. I
assure you that I shall not hesitate to intimate you on anything that would
make your stewardship excellent. You have my utmost regards.
With love and patriotism, I remain
Sincerely yours,
Wa Zo Bia.

From soccer to liquor: Taraba’s terrific approach to handling the coronavirus,https://punocracy.com/tarabas-approach-handling-coronavirus/,2020-05-10T09:37:31+01:00,"It is very normal that laudable and enviable feats go
almost unreported by the eagle-eyed Nigerian media – the universally acclaimed
watchdog of the Nigerian society. Nigerians know that the watchdog’s eyes are
only fixed on the camp of a political rival, watching out for the shortcomings
of the rival in order to score a political point to the advantage of the
political juggernaut(s) financing the watching media house.
The lack of attention given by the media is more when you come from a highly remarkable, distinguished and uniquely-progressive place like Taraba. A state that has chosen to remain as it was yesterday, today, and determined to remain so forever, while its neighbours are glammingupandan,right, left, and centre.
With the aforesaid in mind, it is no surprise that the incredibly strong compliance with the measures put in place by the government to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has gone unnoticed, unpublicised and, as expected, un-lauded. It is my intention to cast light on same and to perhaps inspire other states to follow suit in what will most likely go on to be dubbed the “Taraba Example”.
In Taraba, there are many who believe that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax. Not minding the fact that it is a global problem, they see it as a ploy by Nigerian government officials to enrich their already overflowing pockets. While I may not fault their thought entirely, I am moved to rejoice. By the time the doubting Dabangs realise that the threat is real, contagious and fatal, it will shock them like barbed wire. That time, I will sit somewhere and watch the 5D streaming of their struggle for life using my 5G network – Deathflix at its best! To be forewarned?
There are those who believe the threat is real but also believe they are God’s favourite and a sanctified sub-species of the human race. This group feels there is no need to comply with the measures put in place by the government to curb the spread of the disease.
It is their pious hope that when the spirit of corona approaches them, they have the blood of Jesus to serve as their hand-sanitizers and nose-masks; those who are Moslems among them feel they can dispel the virus with Quranic recitations. It is true that this people have intensified their attendance in churches and mosques against the directive of a government that allows people to go to market twice in a week but not an hour to go to church or mosque.
The lockdown order seems to be only for those in the capital. Inhabitants of communities outside the capital regard themselves as living in a world of their own. To them, corona or no-corona, life goes on as usual.
The public and civil servants amongst us see the stay-home directive as one big holiday of a lifetime for them. Thus, they are now regulars at pubs andburkutujoints, making merry to stupor. What do you expect from them when you get paid regularly without having to work for it? They reckoned that the frugal regime of Gen. Mu-Bu (Rtd) and the third-term deserving administration of Double-Dee Eye have never been this generous to the hardworking servants of both the country and the state.
The best thing to have emerged from the countless rendezvous at the pubs and joints is the discovery that alcohol intake fights the coronavirus far better than the immune system.
Since club football went on a corona-induced sabbatical, Taraba’s vibrant youth decided to fill the void. They have transformed themselves, overnight, from football fans to footballers. If you want to catch up on any league, the place to be is Taraba. In my neighbourhood, Arsenal FC, after years of trying and coming short, finally won the Jalingo-UEFA Champions League. The winning goal was scored by their Brazilian import, Dabang, with the assist from influential playmaker, Lakunju. Arsenal will go on to play at the Jalingo-FIFA Club World Cup that is scheduled to take place at the magnificent Afolahan Square.
The security personnel manning our borders are the best in
the country. Describing them as diligent, dedicated, relentless and brimming
with integrity is to do them a disservice. They are incorruptible! Bribe them
with a loaf of bread to pass; they would frown at that conduct. Give them the
usual N100 or N200; they will punish you for it. But if you give them a
thousand naira; they will manage it and grant you a passage to and fro.
This complete work would be incomplete if I fail to most gratefully acknowledge NCDC and the Taraba Task Force on COVID-19 for the outstanding job they are doing. They are too diligent, too diligent that a patient slipped off their radar without them knowing. That was not enough; they took the sample of persons suspected of having the virus and allowed them to go into the state to preach that corona is real. The thunder that wants to strike them is only waiting for them to strike the perfect pose.
The elders in their wisdom believe that the stubborn housefly will follow the corpse to the grave. They also have it that the death of a clown has never been a funny event. Playing the fool in this perilous time amounts to the housefly fighting for the ownership of the casket with the corpse. Taraba is God’s gift to the nation, may our folly not make us COVID-19’s gift to an insatiable grave.
Can your state’s level of compliance compare to ours?"
How to become a prodigal son in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-become-a-prodigal-son-in-nigeria/,2020-05-07T17:06:42+01:00,"By: Sultan Quadri
He is the lover of the masses and he feels their pain, why won’t he? After how defeat dealt with him what do you expect? He is overburdened and needs blessings of God more than the 89.2 million poor Nigerians.
He has lavished his luxurious items and is forced to live his days with dirty and rag-loving people. He has suffered just like everyone else and will now rise against the government.
He calls his former friends evil and his master a thief. He was unjustly sacked because he did the job better than his master. Who would think such a diligent man existed in our sweet nation? Well, everyone has freedom of speech but acting skills are divine and are to be employed strategically to prove how innocent one has always been.
Come let me whisper in your ear a sure way to creep into the hearts of Nigerians after failing them. It is a masterclass reserved for clowns and loud frenemies. You don’t want the people to see through your pure lies, follow me to the rooftop; at least there is no wall there.
These are the things you will need to do:
It is quite easy to do this, our digital world will help you. You just need to amass a large following after engaging in multiple clownish videos, be a good actor and wash your dirty linen in public. These are all you need to generate attention. In fact, set a new record as the only sitting senator to feature in a music video. Not only that, make it glamorous like getting the title of the song named after you.
You would have gotten the attention of our ever-busy populace who only find solace after every hard day on social media. Their attention is not enough, get them to rant. Don’t worry, no harm will come to you. They will just increase the comments under your posts.
This will be one of your major weapons. You need to play with the emotions of frustrated Nigerians. They are easy to manipulate and at least you have been doing it for long.
Post false contents and out of context information at fragile moments and watch them rain curses on their leaders. You are savedna; you are not their leader anymore, you didn’t even pass through the gates of the national assembly. The day you were forced to do that, you broke your arm.
You can also upload outdated videos and label them as recent. You need enough fuel to get to their hearts, just incite them with provocative and yet outdated articles, little by little they will see you like the saint you are.
This is the ace up your sleeves, you mustn’t fail to use it. At least, the last time you read your Bible, you saw the words, “Who is not against us is with us.” No, you are not manipulating the Bible; tell them to close their eyes so that you can pray for poverty to leave them since it is not a physical thing.
You just need to argue that when you were in power you evicted it but it refused to leave.
I hope this is not too much information? I trust you, it is only people who are not smart that question your certificates. Let’s be grateful Nigerians don’t trust their government. Criticised it and your sins, sorry your transgressions, will be forgiven … that is, of course, if you have any.
Lend your voice to things you don’t even understand so far it pleases the people or misleads them. Either way, you win.
The average Nigerian loves prayer, even if it is from the wrong person. Quote a Bible verse that shows you wait upon God so that the people can see that you are all in the same predicament.
Share verses so that the people can use their faith wisely and typeamen!since we are all in trying times. Who doesn’t love a Christian that reads his Bible? In fact, you will be a role model to the younger generation, revered and honored as a Pastolician.
Once in a while, you can type in capital letters all through to vindicate yourself. Confess your crimes, show how sorry you are, and promise to fight the government for the people. It is then you can achieve your ultimate goal of getting your burdens relieved. You become accepted as aprodigal son."
A compact list on how to be a Covidiot,https://punocracy.com/a-compact-list-on-how-to-be-a-covidiot/,2020-05-05T08:39:49+01:00,"By: Ibrahim Williams
You probably have heard of the newest cool thing in town — Covidiotism. Yeah, I’m sure you know the meaning of this happy word, and if you don’t…
To be a Covidiot in this Corona-maniac period is a smart and enviable thing to be. Trust me; it is what the who-is-who in the country are aiming for, so why don’t you beat them to the game?
Before I tell you how, it might interest you to know that there are a million perks to being a Covidiot — especially in Nigeria. Chiefly, you would be ranked and mentioned alongside such illustrious men as: The three-time Granny Award Winner, Zlatan Ibile; President of the Oyo rally troupe, Oloye Seyi Makinde; the Professor from UITH (Ilorin); the Young Emir of the elite, HRE Garba Adamu II; the King with a dented crown, HRH Dr. Yahaya Bello; the Amazing Professor Pastor Chris; the Anointed Apostle Suleman; Professor Femi Fani-Kayode; among many others.
If you step up the game of Covidiotism, who knows you might end up as a top trend on Twitter NG for days. You see what I’m saying? Cool, huh?
Now, to be a Covidiot
you will need to do one of the following:
One:Denounce the reality of the coronavirus.
Two:Make videos of yourself spewing beautiful nonsense about the pandemic.
Three:Break the lockdown protocol and, if possible, move your mattress to the main road and lie on it — like the legendary Zlatan Ibile.
Four:Be a ‘man of God’ and make a public announcement declaring the quit-notice date for the coronavirus.
Five:Create a list of whimsical medication that ‘cure’ the virus.
Six:Create, share, and support unverified, our outright fake, news on the virus.
Seven:Panic buy to the point where you buy what you know you won’t need.
Eight:Hike prices of commodities for the pleasure of cashing out quickly like any sharp businessman.
Nine:Say it out loud that the NCDC warnings are a hoax and social distancing is a weapon to contain the masses in a box of suffering. In other words, speak about the NCDC before you think of what to say.
Ten:Innovate new things like Corona cup, Corona concert, Corona aerobics tournament, Corona party, and all and all.
Voila! Here you have it: A compact list of things to do to be a Covidiot. If there are other things on the list that I missed out, come to the comment section, let’s discuss."
A note to House of Representatives spokesperson: My apology | David Hundeyin,https://punocracy.com/a-note-to-house-of-representatives-spokesperson/,2020-05-05T08:23:44+01:00,"Good day, Benjamin.
You are probably used to being referred to as “Honourable Kalu,” but unfortunately I have never been one for using honorific descriptors when engaging with elected representatives. You’ll have to excuse my lack of respect and not hold it against me while you read this. Blame it on my poor upbringing where good Nigerian values like genuflection, poverty and folding myself down to the size of a single Okin biscuit in the presence of power were not taught to me.
I am writing this with respect to our exchange over the weekend on the subject of the draft Infectious Diseases Bill, which was smuggled through two readings in the House despite as many as half of its members not seeing it. A lot of things happened in the aftermath of aninvestigative storyI wrote, which broke down the draft bill and exposed it as a threat to constitutional democracy and a comprehensively plagiarised farce.
I would have liked to send you this apology privately, but I am constrained to do so here on the pages of a national daily because following our little exchange, you blocked me on Twitter. I hope you get to read this and understand that I am truly sorry about a lot of things, and I wish I could change them even though they were not all my fault.
I am sorry for the severe emotional pain I must have caused you by exercising my constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech while critiquing a draft bill that you and your colleagues think is none of my business.
Let me start by apologising for the fact that at a time of unprecedented global and national economic upheaval, you were apparently the best person that the people of Bende federal constituency in Abia State could find to represent them. I offer my heartfelt sympathy to the good people of Bende because if you were all that was available, I can only imagine how hard life must be for them. One day hopefully, things will get better.
I wish to apologise to the people of Nigeria in general, for being in a position where someone as thoroughly unsuited for democratic representation not only sits in their Lower House, but is actually the House spokesperson. Worse still, the fact that you are not a one-off fluke, but a broadly accurate representation of those who sit in the House underlines the misery of the Nigerian condition. Sorry to us all.
You see, when you appeared on national television on Friday morning and proceeded to inform the country that the passage of a bill that would end all our civil and property rights was not our business and that we should face our respective fronts and “respect the House,” I was not angry at you as an individual. Even when you called me an “alarmist” on television and attempted to discredit my hard work by claiming that I created a false impression about the bill’s originality, I did not hold it against you. You know why?
The reason, Benjamin, is that I understand you. A popular preacher asked the questions in another context, but I understand how you exist and how you were formed. I know where you come from and I know “who you are.” I have spent a lot of my life around people just like you – people who see the titles of public office as the next milestone in their careers after achieving what they consider to be success. After getting the degrees, building the careers, marrying the childhood sweetheart/trophy wife, building the dream houses, buying the cars, having the children and getting the chieftaincy title, what else is left?
Going into politics of course.
For you and hundreds of your colleagues in the National Assembly, seeking electoral office was a self-aggrandising career move that had nothing to do with any desire to serve or represent people in Bende or Mushin or Ilejemeje or Tundun Wada. You probably have as much in common with your typical constituent as I do with someone from Swaziland. As far as you are concerned, you are their king and they must respect you accordingly.
People are fond of saying that you don’t know why you are there, but this is wrong – you know exactly why you are there. You are there for the title and perceived status, which is why even on Twitter, your account name is “Ben Kalu (Spokesperson House of Reps),” even though the bracketed information is already available on the account’s bio. The purpose of such strategic tautology does not escape me – “they” must know exactly who Benjamin Kalu is before engaging him.
Of course, this isn’t just about you, Benjamin. I also have to apologise on behalf of the Nigerian people to whom the concept of asking for and requiring more of those who would be their leaders and representatives is as unfamiliar as snow
I can only apologise to you for raining on your parade by reminding you that regardless of how bastardised Nigeria’s political system is, you WILL respect the fact that you are merely an elected messenger, not the emperor you fancy yourself as. As I told you just before you petulantly blocked me, it is not my job to “respect” you – it is your job to respect Nigerians. Clearly, judging by what you did next, you did not want to hear this at all. Sorry about that, Benjamin. My bad.
I am sorry for the severe emotional pain I must have caused you by exercising my constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech while critiquing a draft bill that you and your colleagues think is none of my business. Why, it’s almost as if by carrying out my responsibility as one of the few remaining independent public interest journalists in Nigeria, I am a walking, breathing reminder that not every Nigerian is an impoverished, ignorant, forelock-tugging serf with low self-esteem who does not know the difference between an elected representative with no executive power whatsoever like yourself, and a Supreme Everlasting Leader in the mold of Kim Jong-Un.
We can’t be having any of that now, can we Benjamin?
Of course, this isn’t just about you, Benjamin. I also have to apologise on behalf of the Nigerian people to whom the concept of asking for and requiring more of those who would be their leaders and representatives is as unfamiliar as snow. I am sorry because despite having widespread instant access to the biggest free information resource humanity has ever created – a resource that could help them understand how badly you and your colleagues are shortchanging them – they would rather use their internet access exclusively for entertainment and fighting with Ugandans on Twitter.
The country in whose hands the destiny of at least 1 billion of humanity’s most mistreated people rests is populated by victims of the 5 Monkeys Experiment. They have been conditioned over decades of Murtala Mohammeds, Muhammadu Buharis, Ibrahim Babangidas and Sani Abachas to expect nothing from people like you except the occasional handout that must be received with a joyous, grateful smile and a hearty “THANK YOU SIR!” for the privilege. Maybe throw in a few old ladies singing your praises and pronouncing blessings from the gods into the bargain.
I must say sorry on their behalf because it is their undue docility, intellectual incuriosity, low self esteem and cultural lack of purpose that creates and throws up people like you as Nigeria’s representatives and leaders. If Bende were a county in Michigan or a borough in London, you would have exactly zero chance of getting even a seat on the local council board, much less a seat in the national parliament. You didn’t elect yourself, so clearly the people themselves are also your enablers.
I must apologise for them, and also for the fact that they gave you the idea that everyone in Nigeria is a knock-kneed weakling who cowers at the sight of titles like “Spokesperson House of Reps,” instead of seeing it as exactly what it is – the spokesperson for a group of people elected to represent communities.
You have now encountered someone who sees you for exactly who and what you are – clearly you are not a fan. I sympathise.
But the thing is, Benjamin, I am not your enemy. Your own people in Abia State have a saying, “Okuko na-arogoro ite onu, chetekwe mma gburu ya,” which means “The chicken frowns at the cooking pot, ignoring the knife that killed it.”
It is all well and good making me your new enemy because I pointed out that you are not very good at your job and that hurts your ego. The real problem, however, is that you clearly and blatantly lack credibility. If you were worth the respect you are so keen to demand, you would have it. I have never seen John Bercrow or Nancy Pelosi on Twitter or on TV demanding that their constituents should “respect” them. Respect is earned organically, not requisitioned like an inflated line item in a House of Reps committee budget.

5 things the media won’t tell you about Bill Gates,https://punocracy.com/5-things-the-media-wont-tell-you-about-bill-gates/,2020-05-05T08:10:31+01:00,"I know him. We all know him. He is the founder of Microsoft. He’s a geek with a lot of money. He was one of those kids you could look at and say, “Yeah, he has two heads.” But this is just the epidermis of the man William Henry Gates III. You know too little about Gates. Let me introduce you to the world’s most mysteriously dangerous man.
According to the hot-tub magazine issue 666 published in 1954, a mysterious incidence was recorded in a city in America. A middle-class family was robbed by a smudge looking thief claiming he was from the future. The thief attacked the house of Mary and Gates, and coerced them into having sex that night. Although he didn’t steal money or property, the thief stole their dignity as a couple. He also commanded them to name the child Bill whenever they gave birth to him. Bill is a time-traveller from the future who wanted to control the most bills of money ever made. Don’t you wonder why this investigation was published in the issue 666 of hot-tub magazine? Bill Gates is the anti-christ and he went from the future to plant himself into Mary (yes, same name as mother of Christ), in order to take over the world.
He has Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He donates money to ONE Campaign. He gives money to Rotary International. If you’re a thief who does not want to be caught, won’t you also start cleaning your trail? Bill Gates wants the world to accept him as our saviour so that when he finally reveals himself to us as the Antichrist, we won’t fight back. It’ll be too late. Bill Gates the time traveler warned us about coronavirus since 2015. He is now introducing the cure in 2020 after his plans have been set to motion. He wants to introduce a control chip through vaccine. We will not cower before you Bill Gates. You’re the Antichrist and your days are numbered. As the Bible said, “The gates of hell shall not prevail”.
The devil does not need education, does he? When he was in high school, they reported that Bill used to leave class to go and work on computer. Please note that this was before we had smooth computers in the world. This was at a time when computers used to occupy a whole house to work. But Bill Gates knew the formula to taking over the world and he has been working on it for years. When his mates were in school, he would sneak out during the day to use computer. He’ll sneak out of the house at night to use computer. When his father used his influence to get University admission for him, he dropped out because he knew more than the University. Why won’t he know more? Someone who has come from the future to plan our doom. But does he know more than God? No.
If you were a bad man trying to take over the world and you wanted to test your medicine, won’t you try it in a place filled with people so that when they die the world won’t suspect. Look at all the money Bill Gates is donating, why are they always in Africa? He’s trying to end malaria in Africa by killing mosquitoes. Is he God? He’s trying to end Polio in Africa by giving vaccine when only God can give us the solution to our problems. When leaders in Northern Nigeria tried to resist, he gave them money and killed children to threaten parents. He has been using Africans as his scapegoats since all these years. He is fighting poverty. He is fighting polio. He is fighting malaria. All the things that God gave us to show he is God. Bill Gates is questioning God’s creations. And he is doing it in Africa because he knows we don’t have the money to fight back. He hates the world. He wants to control it. And he is starting in Africa.
Bill Gates started talking about coronavirus in 2015, a year that ends in 5. He has been giving us hints since. He donated $58 billion to fighting poverty. If you look at Windows logo, you’ll see 4 small squares which then make up a big square. 4+1 = 5. Bill Gates was born in 1955. He became a professional in 1975. He entered Forbes list in 1995. We could go on and on about Bill Gates and his 5G plan. This is the last part of all his plans. Bill Gates is not trying to save us. He created the virus to control us. As humans, we need to resist Bill Gates for the glory of God. We cannot allow the Antichrist have this victory over us. He is not our Lord and saviour. He is our end and doom.
Bill is a time-travelling Antichrist who feeds the world so he can kill it. It may seem illogical to you, but don’t you feed your chicken to kill it later? Exactly. Fight for your life. Protect your family. Pray to God. Bill Gates must not be allowed to win."
China jealous as Nigeria imports another draconian legislation from Singapore,https://punocracy.com/china-jealous-nigeria-imports-legislation-singapore/,2020-05-05T07:56:40+01:00,"BEIJING (The T.A. Report)―  Top officials of the Chinese government have become green with jealousy over Nigeria’s growing legislative romance with Singapore, a flawed democracy in Southeast Asia, The T.A. Report has learnt.
According to our sources, China sees bilateral Singa-Nigerian relations as a threat to the Sino-Nigerian dream and ultimately the Asian country’s plan to take over the world.
“Nigeria is very key to the Chinese New World Order agenda,” explained our analyst for Asian Stuff, Shampoo Lee, who has just recovered from an uphill battle with COVID-19.
“If we continue to be in bed with Singapore, we may eventually lose our eligibility for loans from the Exim Bank of China. Before you know it, we become broke and unable to pay salaries. Before you know it, Nigeria becomes a publicly listed company on the Ghanaian or South African Stock Exchange.
“It’s a downward spiral, believe me,” Lee added.
It will be recalled that, last week, Nigeria imported a draconian law from Singapore called the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill. The T.A. understands that its actual name is the Infectious Diseases Act Pro Max, a slightly upgraded model of the original law enacted in 1977.
Meanwhile, it is not the first time this sort of transaction will be taking place. Last year, the government also received cyber-lashes for importing another heavy-handed legislation from the Asian country, the tear-rubber Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations Bill, 2019 latest model.
“We have a lot of oppressive laws that can be exported too. We even have laws that allow the government to spy on people and kill anyone with little or no excuse,” one source within the Communist Party of China, who asked to be anonymous because there is a law against speaking about Chinese laws, told our correspondent.
“If Nigeria is not satisfied with our current laws, we can also sell those from the ancient Shang and Qing dynasties, or even ones we have not enacted,” the source added.
The speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabibahose, who introduced the controversial Infectious Diseases Bill has cleared the air about allegations that it was plagiarised.
“People need to be educated about the different between plagiarism and importation,” he told The T.A. Report on Monday. “How can you say we copied and pasted the law when we paid millions of dollars for it from the COVID-19 Intervention Fund? I don’t think that is fair at all.”
There are indications that the National Assembly is currently sampling and negotiating prices for additional Singaporean laws, having received news of the receipt of over $300 millions Abacha loot.

When the devil himself holds a masterclass on how to make heaven,https://punocracy.com/when-devil-holds-masterclass-heaven/,2020-05-04T08:52:34+01:00,"The bible tells us that the devil was once an angel. In fact, he was the head prefect before heeff-ed up, fell out of God’s grace, and was cast out of heaven into the pit of hell. It was also categorically portrayed in the late ’90s Mount Zion movie “Ishawuru” that the devil knows the bible like the back of its palm and there is nobody on earth who can match its biblical knowledge. So how dare we to question the know-how of the devil anytime he decides to hold a master class on how to make heaven?
With all the biblical evidence, we can conclude that it’s not only rude to question the authenticity of the Devil’s scriptural dexterity but also a punishable offence. Nigeria is a very special country and we can never thank God enough for His blessings upon us. More than any country, God has blessed us with Devils of different versions, enough to last us till the end of time. From government devils to business to science to religion, and our devils are never tired of preaching how to make it to heaven. Brothers and sisters, aren’t we verily blessed?
There is a very sweet proverb that the devil you know is better than the angel you don’t know. Who angeleep? Angel that will just be speaking English but will never do giveaway. Angel that we don’t even know what will become of him, we don’t like angels around here. We would rather stick with the old devils that we have come to understand how they attack and wrap it up with the promises of heaven than living in fear of what may happen – the fear of uncertainty with angels. We make memes out of the antics of our devils. We love our devils.
Our devils are not spontaneous, we know their reach – even if they sell this country, they won’t still be breaking our hearts. Remember the aged was once young and trendy, and the devil was once an angel. If an angel would eventually turn to a devil, why notkukustick with the ones we know than investing in another transition that will cost us a huge amount of resources?
Exactly 10 am on 30thof April 2020, I was routinely scrolling through my Twitter timeline when I bumped into an article. It was yet another masterclass on how to make heaven from hellfire but this one is titled “How to Pull Nigeria from the Brink.” Can you guess which devil dropped that one? It is okay if you can’t; I did not see his name too. I got carried away by the brilliant composition and presentation of the sermon that I almost forgot it was coming from the pit of hell. The devil is not always a liar, you know. In fact, Nigerian devils are not liars at all. They are only prudent in the department of truth and transparency. As a people, we can’t afford to lavish our truth reserve; it will crush us.
The article highlighted some challenges caused by the devils in power. This devilatikulated– with serious figures – his resentment of how the ruling devils have refused to accept that Hellfire’s economy will sink alongside the oil market and how economic diversification has been overlooked over and over. He brilliantly claimed that oil is not the future and mentioned how others are already making it to heaven by steering away from the oil economy. No lies. He indirectly implored his counterpart from the other section of hell fire to wake up and start building another embezzlement funnel in Agriculture. Soon,oil money no go reach share again.
Believe me, this devil is brilliant and filled with progressive ideas but,wo,devils never run out of ideas when they need something. As a devil, you must be able to embellish your BS with irresistible offers. A devil with good ideas is automatically an angel. And this is why Hellfire will remain hellfire. He continued to lay down his true claim. He urged the devils in power to do everything he forgot to do when he was in power. What a nationalist! What a patriotic devil! He’s gradually winning me over, one more masterclass like this and he will become my favorite devil too.
He also said no devil deserves to keep 10 planes in the Presidential Air Fleet, not evenBaba-Satan himself. He saidBaba-Satan is still using the plane that transported him from heaven to hellfire many years ago; he said others should learn prudence and leadership from their father who dwells in hell. But you know if not for fight, music would not have turned into proverbial insult. To be fair, you shouldn’t tell people not to enjoy what you enjoyed during your time.
Myfavfurther said managers seek out to manage the existing resources while leaders launch out a creative pathway to see the nation to political and socio-economic greatness, and he identify as a leader and not a manager. He said the problem with the devils in power is that they completely lack the creativity of true leadership and are even doing a terrible job as managers. Where is the lie? Another true yarn in the bag.
“How did our country go from being a net exporter of agriculture products to a net importer of food products? How did we go from a country that could feed itself to one that desperately depends on foreign imports for survival? The answer to these question is leadership focus.”
Don’t be surprised, the devil actually wanted you to answer those questions. Oh, hold up, he answered it, myfavis the most considerate among his peers. He said our problem is leadership focus.Wow!Who would have thought that’s the source of our problem?
How do you spell hypocrisy in your language? Don’t get the wrong idea; this is definitely not hypocrisy but the height of patriotism. Ask questions, hold your leader accountable, offer solutions if you have any. It is not hypocrisy to have a double face except when you actually claim to have a single one. Now you can clearly see why my devil is not a hypocrite but a staunch nationalist; his face is one. Meanwhile chose your devil wisely because, for a very long time, you won’t be escaping this hellfire. Next time you see or hear a devil preaching how to make heaven, take a seat and be attentive because devils don’t lie."
Nigeria: A satire | John Chizoba Vincent,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-a-satire/,2020-05-02T08:33:33+01:00,"This pieceoriginally appearedin Tuck Magazine and was published in September, 2018.
I don’t know why Nigeria is this good these days. I don’t know why no one is complaining of hunger and pain. We no longer see dead bodies littered in our streets and there is no sound of Boko Haram again. I don’t know why the masses won’t suffer a little. The leaders are so kind that they have made everything precious and beautiful to everyone. No one is meant to suffer in Nigeria again.
His Excellency is working very hard to make sure that every mouth sees food to eat and every eye sees good things from the atmosphere of this country and puts a smile on every face. This land must bring good tidings to all without feeble twisted fingers and a frail body that will tell the other world of our sins. He has commanded that all the political leaders must abstain from corruption, else, he will deal with them in his own way. Yes, His excellency has really pulled down the stronghold of this country and fought corruption heavily. I wonder why you won’t vote for him come the next election…
You know my pen is not dancing to its stupidity. You know it is saying the truth from the button of its bleeding ink. You know what it means to come from a flourishing country like Nigeria where everything is flowing perfectly. We have nothing to worry about. Yes, the tap is opened for everyone to come and fetch water and go. The leaders are serving the masses daily. When a father blesses his children, the children in return pay homage to him. My conscience has told me to write this to his Excellency for a work well done. He has really restructured this country and built a legacy that will last a lifetime. The masses insist that I write him this epistle. He has proven himself beyond reasonable doubt.
Yes! Your people told me to write this to you. Even the ones you gave birth to and those you didn’t. Even those that voted for you in the election and those that didn’t. His Excellency, the country and the masses are much happier with you and recommend you go for a second term.
We are taking count of dead bodies in the streets. Those are the result of well-fed people. Those that saw a surplus of food and decided to kill themselves with it. Don’t mind them. Those dead bodies by our doorsteps are just fools who thought too much wine won’t harm them. The wine you brought for them to celebrate your already won 2019 election, they drank before the party started and killed themselves. Remember your Excellency that when a child that doesn’t know how to make money gets money from his father, he can’t control himself anymore.
And you see those whom your brothers sacrificed for their wonderful cattle, they are just fools this country needed to get rid of. How could they be competing with the number one citizens of this country? Those who lay helpless by the roadside as a result of their excitement for the smoothness of the roads you constructed for us; while the ones that travelled to the other world by our political shoes did so due to their greed and selfishness. Don’t mind them, yes, don’t mind them. Many of them are corrupt and selfish to themselves harvesting from where they did not sow. Yes! Your Excellency, they overfed and travelled to paradise so they could tell those over there of your kindness.
I wonder why the youths have refused to work anymore, the electricity being supplied to them is making them too lazy. Why would a grown man stay at home to watch Telemundo while their leaders are in the road working for the country? Why?
I think you will read this with joy Your Excellency; this will definitely make your intestines swim in joy in your stomach: We received the money you promised us during the 2015 election. Everyone is happy with your doings. We are very happy you are doing us great. In fact, someone hung himself yesterday because of the excitement in the country. And the other person fell into the Third Mainland Bridge because she was so happy with the smooth running of your government.
Our schools are too beautiful for our children to go now. Some of them have decided to sit outside in the open field to learn in order not to dirty the classrooms. And the teachers are well fed these days with wheat and egusi soup. Even the school children are enjoying the three square meals you send to them daily. We won’t let you down your Excellency come 2019. We will gather all our animals to vote for you, yes, both our cattle, goats, fowls; we will gather them because you are the best we’ve ever seen. Don’t mind anyone that criticises your leadership, we are all humans, you can’t please all of us at the same time. You can’t make everybody feel happy at the same time. If there is trust, water won’t be cooking fish. We are all doing fine, my good man.
We’ll vacate our houses soonest just to contribute our own quota for the cattle colony, just to make things easier and better for all of us. We are your subjects and ready to obey you at our own cost. We will be evil masses if we don’t allow the cattle to enjoy the warmth of our precious bed. We must allow them to enjoy our home so that the conversation between them and their rearers could be a great one. We’ll leave our house for them to enjoy as we endure the cosy cold in the forest of life.
Let me ask more from my brothers and sisters what they think about you and I shall return later with more testimonies because this is not the kind of thing we live only for ourself, we need to share it with others.

Kano launches first Centre for Covidiocy and Intervirus Relations,https://punocracy.com/kano-launches-first-centre-for-covidiocy/,2020-05-02T07:59:13+01:00,"By:  Mallam Gandoki
Some days ago, the Kano state government, under the able leadership of Governor Gandollar attained a new milestone as they commissioned the first building in the world dedicated to being the headquarters of the Centre for Covidiocy and Intervirus Relations (CCIR).
It will be recalled that the state’s youth had earlier made a call to the Kano government to create a safe space for covidiots in Nigeria. They even went on to make online protests through videos where they washed their hands into bowls and drank the water to show their allegiance to covidiocy. The state government, as one that listens to its people and makes sure to satisfy their needs in every way and manner, finally decided to grant this special request.
While speaking with Dr. Sanladi, the Director-General of the new centre, he complained bitterly about recent uproar from Nigerians. The shows for concern about Kano are needless, he said, and they even carry with them heavy suspicion as they are being spread byAfonjapagans who are known to be weak and scared of death. He went ahead to mention that the Kano citizenry is not scared of anything at all, supporting his stance by quoting from the Holy Qur’ an:
Qulu nafsin, dhaiqatul maut (Q3:185)
Every soul shall taste death!
Dr. Sanladi asked that if the coronavirus is the airline that flies to paradise, then wouldn’t the Kano state government be wise to distribute free tickets to her entire citizenry?
“How
many people have died uhn? Do you know our population? It is way more than the
millions of dollars our Gandollar can ever carry. So, I still do not understand
why people are panicking. After all, our cows are not dying.”
In his inaugural speech at the launch, His Excellency, Governor Gandollar, emphasised how amazing the covidiocy project is going in Kano. He also reacted to the press release given by President Sinzu where Kano was ordered to go on a two-week lockdown. He mentioned that the president was talking in the nonsense, in the rubbish, and in the thing that does not have a good experience.
In his words: “This is blatant cheating. How will you set Lagos and Ogun free and lock us down? Are we slaves? It is disheartening that a fellow northerner will join leagues withAfonjasandOjukwusto look down on Hausa men.”
Governor Gandollar dedicated the CCIR headquarters to the spirit of Kano people who are planning to travel to the afterlife very soon. He also made a plea to the federal government towards the end of his speech.
“We hope the federal government can come to our aid as they’ve aided other states too. Kano state is part of Nigeria and we have our right to the money Nigeria has received to fight corona from international organisations. Sinzu must give us our share,” he said.
“I, however, want to urge that the support is in millions of dollars because the pandemic we are battling came from a foreign country and, as such, we need foreign currency to fight it successfully.”
This act will go down in history as Kano is the first state in the world to build a facility for CCIR; little wonder they sayKano leads, others follow."
Dear single ladies | Bibian Chinenye Pius-Urum,https://punocracy.com/dear-single-ladies/,2020-04-29T09:49:03+01:00,"Dear Single Girls,
I bring you greetings from today’s gospel. I hope that this meets you well.
Always stay around your elders, you will learn a whole lot from them. I’ve always been around my elders and willing to learn too.
Here, let me share some of the things that I have learnt from them. You know I love and wish you all well.
1. DO NOT for any reason at all, go to a hotel.Single girls should not be found anywhere around hotels, it does not say anything good about you.
Do you know how people will feel or what they will think if they see you in, going into or leaving a hotel? They could be your potential family in-law.
Whether it is for a conference, a meeting, an audition or any other official event, do not go. Tell the organizers to find a better venue. Even if it is for a job interview, do not go.
If your church has a hall for worship in a hotel, change your church. Daughters of Zion should not be found in such places.
If you’re visiting a place, do not stay in a hotel. Look for anybody there, preferably a fellow girl, that you can stay in her house. Don’t spend your money in such immoral places. Do you even know what the bed you want to sleep on was used for?
If you want to swim, go to a river or a stream on your village. Do not use a hotel pool, it doesn’t speak well of you.
DO NOT GO TO OR STAY IN A HOTEL.
2. DO NOT wear swimsuits or bikinis to the pool.DO NOT go to the beach wearing anything short or even transparent. If you must swim (in your village stream or river, of course), you must go in your tracksuits, a three-piece suit (if women wear that) or just tie iro and buba.
Do not show off your flesh for any reason. Always cover yourself properly for the man that will finally marry you. Nobody wants to marry a woman that has exposed all her body to the world.
3. DO NOT eat out.Don’t go to restaurants or eateries to eat. Learn how to make your own meals. Learn how to bake. Learn how to make local, continental and intercontinental dishes. It gives you an edge over other women.
Have you forgotten that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach?
Even if your work does not give you time, squeeze out time to cook for yourself.
If you must buy food from a restaurant, take it home and eat. A woman should not be seen eating in such places. It reduces your wife material.
If your boyfriend suggests lunch in a restaurant, take the money, go to the market, buy things, return his balance to him, cook and eat with him at home. He is just testing your wife materialness.
4. DO NOT read courses meant for men.How can you be in a competition with the men? Don’t you know that you are the weaker vessel?
Go for courses that will enhance your wife materialness. For instance, Home Economics and Management, Food and Nutrition, Nursing, Education and any home-related course.
How can you study Engineering, Neurology, Medicine and Surgery, or Political Science? Those are too masculine.
How can you study Law? You want to turn your house to a court room? Don’t you know that most men are scared of lawyers?
5. If you’ve made the mistake of studying masculine courses, DO NOT practise. Fold your certificate and put it inside your box, look for money and start a business that is feminine.
6. DO NOT be too outspoken.Do you want to dominate your husband?
Leave activism and politics for the men. What’s your business with the value of the naira? Buhari is now a stay-at-home dad. Does that affect you in any way? You must not write about everything.
Feminism? Don’t even go there. Just steer clear. Women can never be equal with men. Men are always the head and women, the neck.
7. Even if you have all the money in the world, mind how you spend it.DO NOT consider buying cars, a house or expensive stuff for yourself. Don’t even go on vacations.
Do you want to intimidate and scare men away from your life?
What is a woman without a husband?
If you abide by all the above tips and more that I may share subsequently, you will live a long and happy life, find a good husband, be a good wife and mother, and build a great home.
Your sister in singleness,Bibian(Facebook Celebrity and Slay Queen)
If you have more tips for our single girls, feel free to share. If you want to argue, as usual, go to your wall. My wall is not a democracy.

Open letter: A courageous Almajiri queries President Buhari,https://punocracy.com/open-letter-almajiri-president-buhari/,2020-04-29T09:34:54+01:00,"Your Excellency,
How is the (dis)comfort of Aso Rock? Permit me to skip the niceties and go straight to the crux of this letter: my plight and that of the teeming army of Nigeria’salmajiris. Lest I forget, I know the past few weeks have been difficult for you, especially with the absence of your lieutenant and friend of 42 years, Baba Kyari. I condole with you, Nigerians, and the Kyaris. May Allah (SWT) think kindly of him, forgive him his shortcomings, and grant himAljanah Firdaus. Ameen!
I want to know the plans you have for me and my almajiri companions who on a daily basis adorn the streets, roads and commercial hubs of many Nigerian cities, especially in Northside. I thought that as a responsible leader who cares so much for the citizenry and who upon assumption of office made it clear that you belong to all Nigerians, you will bring up our issue. I did not hear a word on that. It is that loud silence of yours that has compelled me to write this.
Not long ago, we learnt that your government distributed somekudito the poorest of the poor in the country. Nothing got to us. That made me to wonder if there is any group poorer than us. Or could it be we got nothing because we have no bank accounts? But then, do the poorest of the poor keep bank accounts? It is the same sad story with the food palliatives that was meant for those of us who arepoor-vertystricken. Everything in this corruption-free country of ours works like an abracadabra; the more you look, the less you see. The palliatives we received only happened in government’s official records. Nonetheless, we give Allah the glory.
While we give Allah the glory for keeping us alive, we
must bring to your notice that our lives are threatened by the deadly
Coronavirus pandemic that has no regard for social class or qualifications. In
fact, it kills the rich and then pounces on the poor in order to confuse us and
make us incapable of guessing its next victim. Well, that is a gist for another
day, when I’m more comfortable philosophising this.
Social-distancing, hygiene, alcohol-based hand-sanitisers, nose-masks, and other COVID-19 related jargon settle on our ears like Chinese incantations. They convey zero sense and zero meaning to us. Your government has done nothing to bring us up to speed on the prevailing situation. There is no plan to keep us under a roof and see to our welfare in these deadly times. Without sounding like a prophet of doom, I envisage a handsome number of my comrades falling to the shots of a brutal viral disease that does not miss. Maybe we don’t matter. Maybe we are faceless. Or could it be that you think we are too rugged to contract and die of the disease?
I am sure that you are aware that your state governors
have found us a nuisance to be decisively dealt with. We have suddenly become
unfit to remain in those states.  Since
cattle business no longer thrives at the moment, trailers used in conveying
cattle are now being used to farm us out of the respective states. After all,
we are regarded as being only a bit better thanmaalu.  What pains me more is that my own state of
origin, a state I brag about to myalmajirifriends, refused to accept
me. Where then can I call home in this country? What is my offence that has
made me unfit to leave anywhere in Nigeria?
We have been the kingmakers in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule in 1999. Just so you know, when the dust  of this pandemic settles, your attention will not be switched to reviving the country’s battered economy, rather it will switch to winning elections. Then you will come to us on bent backs and crawling knees to crown you kings again.
By the way, despite the hardship that your ineptitude and
cluelessness meted out on Nigerians, failing to fulfil a tenth of your campaign
promises, how on earth do you think you were re-elected? We sponsored you to
that seat. Nigerians cannot forget the million of underage votes we gave you in
Kaduna, Katsina, Kano, etc. Is this how you want to repay our loyalty and
support?
When your government officials are tired of feminine companionship, they take their sexual adventure further by visiting our beds. When they want to rip out the heart(s) off their political opponent(s), they rush to us. When they want to ignite the fire of a riot that they seek to benefit from, they cajole us to help them out. It baffles me how easily we tend to forget things in this country.
We may appear to be nothing and good-for-nothing, but may I remind you sir that no condition is permanent. Who foresaw the rise to prominence of our underpaid medical officers? But as it is now they are more important than the politicians now. Who predicted that akongoof garri would one day sell more than a barrel of Bonny crude? But what did COVID-19 make us realise? No condition is permanent. Where were you when Mandela and Obasanjo moved from prison to the presidency?
It is my utmost hope that the decisions you make regarding us and these trying times will not be rightly queried like your lopsided appointments, technical defeat ofBoko Haramand Nigeria’s anti-corruption war. Now that Baba Kyari is no more, there is no one we can shed some of the blames of your shortcomings on. A STITCH IN TIME SAVES ALL!
Yours faithfully,
A Nigerian Almajiri."
Deaths in the city: What’s gwan inna this our Kano?,https://punocracy.com/deaths-in-the-city/,2020-04-27T09:46:59+01:00,"Roughly two weeks into what would have been Ras Kimono’s 62ndbirthday, I find myself singing the hit song “What’s Gwan?” of his 1990 album of the same name — repeated as if compelled by a supreme force. That song captured his bewilderment at the state of affairs in Nigeria at that time. I find myself asking the same question, especially in respect of the mysterious deaths that are being recorded in Kano — the city of the Dollar-man and his four stooges, sorry, emirs.What’s gwan inna this our Kano?
Granted, we are in a difficult time — a time where the ordinary tends to usurp even the extraordinary. Every event that concerns health and the natural end of man is viewed with a COVID-19-tinted lens of suspicion. It comes as no surprise that the recent deaths recorded in the state have caught the attention of the world.
As at the time of writing this, officials of the Kano government are denying the reports of mass deaths and have promised to investigate the fatal incidents recorded. This is unlike the Kano I know and have read about. The Kano of old was quick to dispel a sprouting allegation of bribery and corruption against Dr. Gandollar OFR and voted him for a second term. The Kano of old was quick in settling the scores of the game of many a presidential election without the stress of an extra-time of rerun by its significant army of underage voters. The Kano of old was swift in enacting a law disintegrating an emirate into four. Not so long ago, the Kano of old dethroned and banished a hot-headed revolutionary emir without the heavens falling. I am surprised that this new Kano is taking much time to establish the cause of the death of its people.
Without being unfair to Kano, let me pause a bit to splash some accolades on the mother of all cities — the city of the great emir, sorry, the city of the four great emirs. Kano’s eulogy recites thus: “Kano ta Dabo tumbin giwa, yaro ko dame ka zo an fika.” It loosely translates to;Emir Dabo’s Kano lacks nothing and is second to none.
When COVID-19 stepped on the much-chronicled city of Kano, inhabitants treated it like any other Chinese export or visitor. A troupe of traditional singers and dancers was sent to welcome it amidst jubilation and fanfare. No kobo was spent from the state’s coffers; they have Gandollar’s dollars to thank for that. A novelty football game tagged “Corona Match” was held in honour of the guest of honour. There, Social-Distancing and Stay-Home orders were defiled before, during, and after the game.
This grand welcome was held to uphold the city’s legendary pride and to prove to the world that the city cannot be frightened into submission by a creature of God that is so small that it cannot be seen by the naked eyes. They also wanted to prove thatCovidocracy(rule by an exported disease) cannot obtain in Kano as their allegiance can only be divided amongst four rulers and not five.
Cityzens of Kano are vehemently opposed to any insinuation that the fatalities that are being recorded, as negligible as the numbers seem, are attributable to COVID-19. The truth is, Kano is killing Kano to prove to COVID-19 that if it thinks it does a good job at killing, it cannot kill better than Kano and, by extension, Naija. After all,yaro ko dame ka zo an fika – come with whatsoever you will find us more than your equal.
You see, the truth is, we don’t need COVID-19 to kill us before wedie our die. Poverty, environmental pollution, youth unemployment, communal strives, religion, politics, bad roads, security forces and the name Nigeria itself is willing to kill you, be it home or abroad, be you young or old, wise or foolish, rich or poor.
To survive Nigeria in these difficult times, all that is needed is to play your part well and hope that you get to elongate your life in Nigeria in order to shame a country that is all out to sever your head from your body.
On a final note, in light of the many problems besetting Nigeria in our times, after much contemplation on the problem with Nigeria, Ras Kimono (if he were to be living in our times) would perhaps conclude with another rendition of his,Under Pressure. Perceptive reader, I leave you with an excerpt of some Rastafarian inspiration:
Under pressure we wail under pressure
Under pressure black people under
pressure
Under pressure Nigerians under
pressure
Under pressure Africans under
pressure
No food in we belly
No money in ah we pocket
No bed we lay we head
The people dem are suffer

Some are weeping! Some are wailing!
Everywhere dah oh eh
Under pressure we wail under pressure
Under pressure everybody under

"Good lawd, how should we mourn our leaders?",https://punocracy.com/good-lawd-how-should-we-mourn-our-leaders/,2020-04-23T07:08:36+01:00,"That Abba Kyari has transited to a higher presidency from Nigeria’s is no news we should bug you with – Too-Know, is thy name. That many are throwingowambeover the death of a man they considered as Nigeria’s surrogate president is a matter we leave you to adjudicate on the propriety of same and sentence the convicts according to thy justice and loving-kindness. Whether he was the architect of someone’s ineptitude and shortcomings in governance is left for us to see now that he has been elevated to a superior presidency. Therefore, we won’t bother you with those issues today – or maybe never!
Good lawd, we have come before you with another set of our endless supplications. We cannot see you but we know you are out there, somewhere in the coolest part of our wondrous universe, listening to us. Sometimes we hear you speak, but most times you drive us crazy with your disturbing silence to the extent that our hallucinating minds tend to hear you speak things that defile logic and common sense. At other times, we get the answers we seek from the varied realities of the unsolicited woes of human life.
Today, we seek to know what we should do when our leaders – elected and appointed – kick the much dreaded bucket. The Holy Book, The Glorious Book and the divine inscriptions indelibly etched in the minds of our elders have unanimously called us to mourn the dead alongside their families and to give them befitting burials. But what if the said leader is a Nigerian (leader)? – A name more corrupt than corruption itself. How should we mourn them? While we seek your face over this dicey issue, permit us to share our own thoughts with you, dear gracious lawd.
When any of them die, we should be able to glam our flag
with a touch of B-Red, Kenny Blaq (Wande Coal black will suffice too!), Chris
Brown and Adekunle Gold. We won’t need Da Grin (because Naija green supersedes
any other and that only the living can mourn the dead). Of course, the
green-white-green cannot be fully hoisted. Which country hoists its flag high
at the dead of its most faithful servants, a group whose only wrong is merely
being corrupt (or should we say being Nigerian?)?
Being Nigerians, it is neither our place not to empathize with the bereaved nor our way to mock the dead, no matter how bad they may have led their lives. Trust us to shut down the social media and conventional media with eulogies, tributes, poems, articles, and songs in praise of our recently deceased national heroes.
For one to have lived a fantastic life of corruption and A-grade criminality in our high places and go undetected and unpunished in a country that prides itself as the bastion of the global anti-graft war is no mean feat. Such an individual is worthy of some deification or, in the least, a beatification. Surely, to evade Nigeria’s anti-corruption war is a stunt that can only be pulled by the divine and super-human. Just so you know, we wouldn’t be tolerant of a mere outspoken one-time Nobel Prize in Literature awardee accusing us of the crime ofThe Beatification of Area Boy(was that even what he intended by that title?).
We cannot mourn our leaders correctly if we don’t declare
forty days and nights of mourning, spending the nights recounting the beautiful
deeds of our leaders like a playlist on repeat.
The same leaders who refused to build for us good roads so the death-traps we ply daily can serve as a metaphor for the narrow, chaotic, bumpy, rough andJulius the Beggarabandoned kinda road that leads to eternal bliss. Thus, ensuring that we are not distracted in our heavenly race.
They concerted to reduce our schools to glorified
playgrounds simply because they want to save us from the corpus of knowledge
scattered out there, capable of defiling the body and soul.
Our epileptic supply of electricity is calculated to
ensure that we do not lose sight of you, our lawd, as the only light of this
dark world. For blessed are those who endure darkness in this world, halogen
lamps await them in the parlour andozarooms of their mansions in
heaven.
Nigerians complain bitterly of the continuous looting of the national cake but little do they know that our leaders are storing it for us in Panama, Switzerland, Colombia et al; where monkeys, termites and snakes cannot steal, chew and swallow it. Besides, they are not unmindful of the fact that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eyes of a needle than for socio-economically stable Nigerians to enter heaven. God forbid that small, worthless Naira notes sentence us to another hell after leaving the hell of Naija.
Our economic deprivation has made Nigerians more scholarly to the extent of us redefining the notion of comfort. Instead of seeking white-collar jobs, we have joined the “-preneurs bandwagon” which does not include entrepreneurs but churchpreneurs, conflictpreneurs, yahoopreneurs, betpreneurs, and the novel megapreneurs (also known as the “One Million Boys”).
Who needs a working health system when we are all destined for a better place where the dethronement of a barrel of crude by two congos of gari, and the reign of this world by COVID-19 (Covidocracy) would be confined to some few pages in a ragged history textbook? Achimugu and Bubu’s Kyari can shed more light on this truism.
Greats cannot depart quietly. Do the skies not blaze forth at the dead of princes? The funeral should be marked by a great festivity – a kind that has never been seen in the world.Egungunsmust perform but not on the express – for we cannot afford death at a funeral. The afro music sensation from that country within a country – Fela’s Republic of Kalakuta (FRK) – must be called upon to performYeparipaon behalf of the inconsolable sea of mourners.
It is understandable when we take our time to mourn and praise our leaders on the joyous occasion of their respective sendoffs from this vile world. We inter them in a hole 6000 fts below by throwing the casket into the abyss in order to discourage them from reincarnating and ensure they trulyRest In Pit. Nigeria has seen enough of them and they have equally done enough for Nigeria that we would not want to see the wake of their clan again.
Good lawd, let us not bother you too much. Take the wheel from us. Teach us. How should we mourn our leaders?
INTRODUCING: “LAMENTATIONS OF AN EGBERE”
To understand this column you must understand the following:
You must have read D. O. Fagunwa’s account of a confrontation between protagonist Akara-ogun and an egbere – a being of the forest of the spirit-beings – inOgboju ode ninu igbo irunmale. I’m not asking too much of you, am I? In that classic (that I consider the greatest work of Yoruba fiction), the egbere in responding to a mockery of his moaning lambasted mankind for being the architect of the countless troubles bedevilling the earth. The egbere race having taken to heart the plight of humanity cannot help but to #occupytheforest with their loud moaning and dripping noses. Humans being humans continue to disregard them and subject them to unwarranted mockery and insults. That has not stopped the egbere race from lamenting the tragedy that is human life.
You must also understand the writer. He speaks of peace but his words project as chants of war. He tries not to hurt anyone but you know the truth dey hot somehow somehow. He tries to make you laugh away your being Nigerian but also invites you to put on your thinking cap, rethink and tinker with your thoughts and perspectives. He seeks to make sense, but the issues he writes about can be utterly senseless – as they should not obtain in a sane clime like Nigeria.
In essence, this column is a continuation of the lamentations of the egbere over the tragedy of merely being a Nigerian and a call to think like Akara-ogun did."
Bring Back Our Mondays (#BBOM)!,https://punocracy.com/bring-back-our-mondays-bbom/,2020-04-22T08:17:30+01:00,"By: Jonathan Ukor
Gradually, we have lost our sense of days. Today,  like yesterday, is another Saturday. We shall eat rice, surf the Internet, talk with a few friends, and sleep like we did in previous Saturdays. The regular Saturday aura isn’t even appropriate anymore to describe our mood these days. We will just continue to live and pay no attention to the calendar on the wall. Oh, the wall! The wall, the gate, and the fences — the goats, chickens and lizards too — they are mockingly terrorising us. Just see how they jeer and do the victory runround about us. The walls, the gate, and the fences with all the free roaming animals are the victors today.
One particular Saturday, we spoke with a friend about “the break point.” That point when our minds have savoured enough Saturdays. Our friend said no such point exists and that we should find a digital platform to lean on. Maybe our friend was right. There are so many activities to engage in. We can condense our spirit, soul, and body into Twitter trends, Instagram Live shows, Tiktok challenges, or Facebook memories. We should alternate activities between Saturdays, until our spirit, soul, and body are consolidated — unbreakable. Today’s victory is ours.
On another Saturday, the Saturday that was supposed to be the day after Sunday, we lost our composure. We stared at the calender, but could only see WhatsApp stickers that taunt our sanity. The message from the ISP read, “Egungun be careful, you have used up 90% of your data bundle.” We became stunned to our marrow and our fingers wiggled due to constant typing. We cried;the ISP’s won today.
It was only a few Saturdays ago we purchased the usual monthly data subscription. What has happened? In a last effort to salvage the current situation, we enrolled for an online course on “How to Make Money from Your Phone.” We will make this money to the shame of the calendar and to the shame of “unlimited data everywhere you go.” If we no make this money,na wetin we gain? Hustlingcontinua, victoria ascerta!
On today’s Saturday, we’ve learnt to make money on our phone — (that is, after we buy the E-book on “How to Make Money from your Phone”) — at an affordable price. We spent the most part of the day viewing pictures on our phone gallery. These pictures made us snivel. Two months ago, we were the primal MCMs with neat beards and well carved hairline; we were the elegant WCWs with enticing cleavage and yummy curves. Now, we are just couch loners with no sense of purpose. The calendar won today.
On today’s protest, we will use the hashtags and rhetoric against the Covidiot geng(awon set olorijatijati). We see them spreading the virus like cheap suya in Kano. We see them in Lagos ignoring social distancing and rallying en masse — one million toys against one million boys. We see them in Abia drinking holy water, but forgetting that cleanliness is next to godliness. They must hear. We shall win.
The only way we can truly win is when our Mondays are Monday-ish. This is the only tie breaker. We miss seeing students adorned in colourful school uniforms. We miss the sight of people arguing near the bus-stop about weekend football matches, as well as the insults and cheers for politicians. We miss the placidity of Lagos BRT buses and the discomfort of the Lagos traffic. We miss our Monday. We will conclude here, because you know what you must do."
How to get the Kogi COVID-19 app,https://punocracy.com/how-to-get-the-kogi-covid-19-app/,2020-04-22T07:36:14+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
It’s incredible how Nigerians are only interested in tarnishing people’s image. There is no amount of work a public servant puts in that they appreciate. They are only interested in badmouthing their leaders.
A few days ago, Gov. Yahaya Bello told us of his incredible effort and first-of-its-kind approach to ensure the people of Kogi are marked safe from COVID-19. The most interesting thing in that interview with Channels television was the announcement of a software application that will help Kogi people monitor their COVID-19 status by themselves. This is highly commendable.
Nigerians started to speak ill of the Governor with allegations that he was telling lies about the App. Has Mr. Gov. ever told a lie before? Come on, he’s the white lion; he can’t lie. More so, going by how much of his campaign promises he has fulfilled, one should know he is a man of his words.
It is true that the App cannot be found on Google Play Store; that is because it is exclusive to the people of Kogi state. Apps of that kind cannot be easily accessed. The mistake people made was that they didn’t ask how to get the app. Who no like better thing? Well, I found it and I’ll tell you. Wait first.
Because of the shared prosperity in Kogi and how the people’s lives have improved since the Gov. came in, everyone in the state can now afford an android, iPhone, or computer. The level of literacy in Kogi is 105 percent, so, the people are very much compliant with technology. Kogi is in a world of its own. They are already in the future. You know Lagos isn’t so creative to think they should create an app for their citizenry. Kogi is proactive and deeply concerned about their people.
Here’s how to get the App:
Okay. The App is actually on Google Play Store, but it is invincible to people with a clean and pure heart. Are you a mediocre or supporter of falsehood? You’ll see the App. Blessed are the wicked in heart, for they shall find the App. The App works with the mind. Don’t bother searching for it if you consider yourself clean in heart.
More so, since it’s on Play Store, be a little bit playful — crack jokes and be unserious — when you’re searching for it. You’ll notice the smile looming all over the Gov’s face while making the announcement. The App exists in the realm of comedy.
If you follow all these steps and you still can’t find it, I’m afraid it’s because your clownish network isn’t so strong. You’ll have to reach Lokoja where the throne of all manner of political jokes is situated, that you may obtain help to be a clown to your people and the nation as a whole."
Sinzu Money finally writes to Imam of Pieces,https://punocracy.com/sinzu-money-finally-writes-to-imam-of-pieces/,2020-04-21T10:50:49+01:00,"By: Dosunmu Damilare
Hello Imam of Pieces;
How are you doing? I’ll save you the niceties, you don’t deserve it. See, I have not come in peace and of course I have not brought war either (because you can’t handle it). I’m writing to warn you for the last time. I would have addressed you by the name your father and mother christened you (ormuslimedor whatever you) but I don’t know it and I’m not sure I want to. If at the end of the day your insulter appetite survives this letter, do what you do best – reply, but be generous with your real name and address. (If not that Shekau said he needs a name and address, who has that time?)
My name is Sinzu Money as you have rightfully guessed and I’m the President of the rotten giant of Africa. Google that, beesh! For weeks now, since the break out of COVIK-1-9, you’ve turned me, my able office and country into a Twitter punching bag, hitting us from both sides. I don’t know if it was boredom or, as my wife has said, it was the hole in your brain.
My patriotic citizens
pleaded with you to stop but you needed to have your fill of attention or maybe
your employer hasn’t signaled you to halt. I don’t give two flying dolphins.
Since the mouth must chop, the mouth must talk. You have taken the advantage of
the laziness of my country’s youth to sit comfortably on the good sides of
their hearts. Because of small giveaways, they now sing your praises and forget
the man who liberated them from that wasteful Jonah. Don’t worry, they will soon
know you for who you are… a nonpareil hate monger. Peace my foot.
Even when my children confronted you and urged you to stop ridiculing their father, you served them with murderous uppercuts. Bashir is still complaining of jaw ache. Poor child. When my adorable Adamu was going to get Ibufine for his brother, he got exposed and contacted COVIDIOCY. Even my brilliant adopted fencist son Abdul-Juwa got a blow in his stomach – he has been vomiting okoto-meow since then.
Why did you lash on little children? Why? You have exhausted all your decency. Do you know you can be prosecuted for child abuse at the international court? I’m sure that’s not strange to you. If not, why did you flee your country? Don’t even say ISIS because that ticketdon cut tey-teyand your cover has been handicapped. The breeze has blown and we’ve seen the fowl’s anus.
Your lack of Islamic knowledge is deafening and you are scamming the world with your religious tolerance. Even though the world knows that the Imam in your name is a format, at least brush up your act and make it worth the show.Shege!With your fake turban that looks like an alloy rim. Idiot. I know you are a yahoo boy trying to cash-out, it is all hustle to you. Na by force? Must I allow you to help with Zaks or Boko Haram? Let me tell you, Zaks is like a little child and I’ve put him where he belongs. Since I’m not a monster like you’ve ignorantly peddled, he is having the time of his life. The last time I asked him to go home, he refused. Why am I even explaining? Rubbish!
Meanwhile, there is nothing like Boko Haram in my country anymore you outdated son of a beesh. Boko Haram is water under the bridge, they are now Chad’s trouble – shebi their president has claimed he knows combat. We shall see.
Imam of Pieces or what is your name (nonsense! henceforth, you will be addressed as 419). Wait, do you know I’m a retiredsojaand once asoja, always asoja? If I handle you and your 2G destiny, your family, your employer, and your brainwashed fans will be sorry for you. In fact, come to Nigeria if they birthed you well, Bello El-Rufai my godson is enough for you.Danboroba!Yes, Bello is not asojao, but I trust it takes one dirty uncouth mouth to handle the other.
All these days, I’ve been silent and kept my cool as if I did not hear or see anything, it was because of Spending. Spending is dead now, your ownaffdone. As if you haven’t orchestrated enough nuisance, you dare speak ill of the man who has been inadvertently saving your arse, by suppressing my resentments towards your antics. You are so bold now that you issue libelous diatribes at will, uncensored as if I was your mate. Spending died of COVIK-1-9 and I’m saddened, my heart is broken. The whole country is grieving a hero and you’re talkingin the rubbish.He was my friend and confidant, and also your saviour. What if the whole country attended his Janaza? What if? You didn’t expect Spending to enter the ground like a commoner? Of course, you did, if not…
419! 419! 419! How many times did I call you? If you still have functioning ears and a brain, stop this bickering, stop this sickly obsession with my name and country, else – even Australia won’t be enough for you to hide. I’m giving you the last warning because I trust it is what you will eat that you are looking for, now hit the brakes before it kills you. It is better for your masquerade to retire from the express now; you’ve done well. You are not the first, ask Saworo Ide. Return what’s left of the money you collected from your contractor and tell them you are done. Don’t worry, send yourAza.I’ll tell Jacuzzi to do you better,let us change your life.
Yours sincerely,
Sinzu Money
President of the Rotten Giant of Africa."
‘Why do good people die young?’… Heartbroken Nigerians mourn Kyari’s death on Twitter,https://punocracy.com/heartbroken-nigerians-mourn-kyaris-death-twitter/,2020-04-19T08:04:20+01:00,"TWITTER (The T.A. Report)― Patriotic and heartbroken Nigerians have taken to Twitter to genuinely mourn the demise of the country’s former Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, one of the greatest men who ever ruled in Africa but who sadly passed away on Friday as a result of a COVID-19 infection.
It all started with Tife (@tife_fabunmi) who said he still cannot believe the great man is no more and has not been able to close the tap of his tears.
“Why do good people die young?” the young man asked, overwhelmed with grief and extreme love for his country.
“He was a leader who was passionate about his people. He worked tirelessly to make the health sector better. Many of us are heartbroken right now. We pray for the strength to bear the loss.”
Tife added that Kyari was “someone who willingly went to the abroad to discuss how to make Nigeria the best country in the world”.
“This isn’t fair. He invested his wealth in changing the health sector in Nigeria. Our President made him his bestie ’cause he was hardworking and patriotic. A Hero!”
The Twitter user’s condolence message struck a chord with other young Nigerians who came out in their hundreds to praise and pray for the late Kyari. He was described as a man with a heart of gold, Assistant Jesus Christ, and one who paid the supreme price in the service of his country.
“I couldn’t sleep overnight. I was in the pool of my own tears. For someone who invested his wealth in giving us 24 hrs electricity. Sad day for Naija, we lost a good man,” wrote the Twitter version of Balogun of Ibadan (@MubarakBalogun).
“I already used four full rolls of tissue wiping away tears, such a bright mind taken away from us when he was doing great,” another Nigerian, The Ayos (@iyam_haryur), tweeted.
One person to whom Kyari donated one of his kidneys, Mr Anyhow (@AnyhowMr) also could not contain his tears as he wondered why good people die quickly.
Zinny (@zinny_biola), a patriotic Nigerian Twitter user who even has the country flag in her name, described the late Chief of Staff as “a leader who had the interests of the people at heart, a true Muslim and a martyr”.
“My heart is shattered,” she said. “May Allah accept his ibadah and make his grave as tolerable as the situation of his home country right now.”
Below are other tweets from the condolence thread:
I didn't even sleep all through the night, this is really a big blow on us????????????????????????
I can't even eat ????. It's so sad. He was a good man, did a lot for the country ????????????.

BREAKING: Nigeria loses Mr Social Distancing,https://punocracy.com/breaking-nigeria-loses-mr-social-distancing/,2020-04-19T07:27:31+01:00,"Few hours after the demise of one of the most powerful Nigerians, Abba Kyari, Nigeria again loses another powerful statesman, Mr Social Distancing, also known as Mr SD, who had been helping the country to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus, otherwise called COVID-19.
Sadly, Mr SD who finally gave up the ghost during the funeral service of Kyari had reportedly been showing persistent difficulty in breathing, after Nigerians stubbornly flouted the “avoid mingling with people” preventive measure against COVID-19.
It should be recalled that Mr SD had also been repeatedly denied ease of access in Nigeria when the citizens came out en masse during the lockdown period and as various constituted authorities jailed him for disturbing the peace of their people.
As a sign of patriotism, Mr SD left a goodwill message for Nigerians which was ably read by Mr Nose-Mask, accompanied by Miss Hand-Gloves who held the microphone for him.
“Although we may not survive without our good frient, Mr SD,” began Nose-Mask, amidst tears, “I will proceed to read his last message.”
“I know my existence will be cut short in Nigeria by her headstrong and lawless citizens,” the message read.
“Nigerians have often seen me as a propagandist not knowing I am the foremost antagonist to the novel coronavirus. ‘Don’t stay close to people,’ Nigerians will not adhere, a disobedience that is perhaps fueled by widespread economic hardship. What can survive in Nigeria? Maybe Terrorism and Political rivalry. Now that I am gone, I know Coronavirus will embrace them. This apparently is what the ignorant Nigerians prefer.”
After the message was read, one Nigerian sneezed thrice and another had fits of coughs; but others were unable to keep safe distances since Mr SD who caused ‘this miracle’ had passed away."
How to die well in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-die-well-in-nigeria/,2020-04-19T07:01:03+01:00,"To be a good citizen of your country, you need to learn from Nigeria. A country where its citizens expose and criticise her politicians and government officials while alive and venerate them at their demise.
To die well in Nigeria, you need to have lived an infamous life. And, to achieve this, first be a politician or hold a public office. Do not be a public or civil servant as the office may imply but endeavour to rule rather than serve. For rulership is for the strong, while service is for the weak and gullible. Make sure abuse sets in, trample on the poor, and lie to them.
Conceal the military ruler, serve the wicked with utmost loyalty. Ignore posterity that does not exist; neither should you acknowledge the role of karma for that is but a myth. Live your moment; after all, you have got only one life to live. Spend public funds, squander them on side chicks and luxurious outings; at least, you feed from where you work. No one will blame you.
And when you are called out on social media, insult those bad bellied folks who know nothing about being wealthy, those naysayers who are hungry and just venting in jealousy and envy towards your respectable self.
This is how to live well, so that
when you die, the wise populace who while you were alive called you a sinner
will end up calling you a saint, as they will come to a revelation of how holy
you lived and would blame death for taking a good man.
There will be video footage over all social media platforms of your grand burial ceremony. It does not matter if many died of the same virus that killed you. Who cares about them. You lived well, better than they did. You held a public office and you served well, obeying to the latter all the earlier stated requirements for living; so you deserve it."
"Nigeria records new case of COVIDIOT, total now 11",https://punocracy.com/nigeria-records-new-case-of-covidiot-total-now-11/,2020-04-18T21:30:46+01:00,"A former presidential hopeful, Garba Adamu, has been added to thelist of COVIDIOTSin the country.
Mr Adamu has now joined ten others, mostly political and religious leaders, who had tested positive for COVIDIOTISM.
He made this list for hisinfamous statementon why Nigerian leaders should be accorded better privileges and recognition at the expense of ordinary citizens, because “this is capitalism”.
He made the statement following the outcry that followed neglect given to physical distancing during the internment of president Muhammadu Buhari’s former chief of staff, Abba Kyari, who died in Lagos on Friday.
Mr Adamu added that, except Nigerians work harder, the privileges and recognition political leaders get will continue  to elude them.
Research shows that the younger the former presidential hopeful is, the wiser he thinks (and vice versa).
Observers have also wondered why Mr Adamu could not understand that COVID-19, the mother virus of COVIDIOTISM, is no respecter of anyone, rich, old, poor or young.
After a barrage of reprimand from the public, with the hope that he would come to his senses, Mr Adamu has maintained his stance.
He has since been admitted to the Intensive COVIDIOTISM Unit in a clinic close to his home.

How to sell Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-sell-nigeria/,2020-04-18T08:19:00+01:00,"By: Hamzat Mariam
You’ve probably thought about how to sell this country a couple of times. Well, you’re not alone. Rest assured that thousands of other people have been waiting for advice on how to go about the same thing.
“We should just sell this country and they
should give us the money, abi who Nigeria epp?”
Right? Well, as a Nigerian who fits into a status or belongs to a particular caliber of people, I’m glad to inform you that you are eligible to sell your country. You are officially a shareholder.
To sell a country so unique and different from other countries, here are some essential tips to take note of.
The first identity you have before that of being Nigerian is that of your tribe. Nigeria has about 240 ethnic groups and tribes, but since it is becoming harder for all of them to stay together, you might as well use this opportunity to sell the country.
Work on the division already in existence in the country and make use of that to determine who goes where. The Yorubas can pick US, the Hausas can pick Saudi Arabia, while the Igbo people go to Dubai. Sell out the other tribes and tell the buyers they are the bad people. Yorubas are the thieves, Igbos are experts in lies and deceit, and Hausas are Boko Haram. Scream to whoever cares to listen that your tribe is the best, and let them move your people out to help uplift their own country.
As a celebrity, you’ve been to various countries and seen the conditions they live in. Do not hesitate to bring that up whenever you have the chance. Whether it’s on your channel, your Instagram live session or even that of a foreigner. Comment about how that bottle of milk they are wasting can save millions of Nigerians from starving. Talk about how people are suffering and how they are the architects of their own misfortune. You already have the spotlight, use it to Nigeria’s advantage and help all of us.
As a pastor, do you even need a country? The kingdom of God is sure and everlasting; do not hesitate to make that decision. Who needs a fairly used country when the kingdom of God reigns forever? Use your evangelism to sell the country and convince these rich countries to buy Nigeria, like you minister to the poorest to pay their tithes.
Now, as an average Nigerian, you have to be strategic with the selling. You can’t just call an agent to check Nigeria and find a buyer for it. No, first you have to cry out for help. Use all social media pages to trend, this could include trends such as  #WeAreSuffering, #BuyNigeria. Become a keypad warrior! Maybe the United Nations will take pity on these suffering people in a forgotten nation and decide to pay the shikini money needed to buy Nigeria. How will you receive your share? You’ll receive it the same way relief money for the coronavirus was shared.
As a friend of the ruling party, encourage loans. As a governor or president, go for foreign loans. Borrow, borrow, borrow, and borrow till Nigeria becomes so indebted we won’t have a choice but to foreclose the nation.
Other
nations will be expected to bid of course, so the country with the highest bid
or proposal can easily win and buy Nigeria out.
Selling a country like Nigeria requires strategy, therefore, you have to be careful about how you go about it. If you belong to a caliber which has not been mentioned, kindly drop your group, so our experts can help you out with how you can also cash out from your loyalty to the fatherland."
"Gatekeepers, Wrinkled Paper, and Littlefinger",https://punocracy.com/gatekeepers-wrinkled-paper-and-littlefinger/,2020-04-17T05:57:45+01:00,"Brevity, they say, is the soul of wit. Coynobi, however, made a joke that got all of us laughing, and it wasn’t short. It was a circus performance. Since the lockdown started, everyone has been starved of entertainment; moving from one challenge to the other, one movie to the next, twitter turf wars, and on this day, the baton fell on the writing community.
The joke was performed by Obi-wan Coynobi, in protestations to actions taken by Mrs I-tried-to-give-a-fuck (aka ITTGAF — shortened to ITT). This joke wouldn’t be fun, nor comprehensible (and comprehensive), if we do not start from the past.
MANY MANY YEARS AGO… there was a meeting by an extensive network of people called the gatekeepers of the Nigerian literary world, who were good friends with a powerful blacksmith. They called the blacksmith Littlefinger; a dramatic no-nonsense man from the north of Africa’s west.
Littlefinger was renowned across all classes;  especially among people he locked up in dungeons for talking too much. Littlefinger had a reputation for talking when it suited him; but it repulsed him—a man of great social standing, feared, loved, and respected—to share this garrulous feature with commoners.
So he starts a crusade of locking up anyone who spoke when he did. And anyone who spoke about him. Some people came together, concerned by the intellectual sacrilege being performed on their friends who traded in the same business of talking, they went to meet Littlefinger, and Littlefinger handed them a cup of conversation, and a bowl of tea. They drank their fill, and negotiated their freewill. It was rumoured that Littlefinger gave them the gatekeepers a bag of chocolates. Many of them—the gatekeepers—have denied the chocolate, but the tea spills from their mouth when they talk.
The gatekeepers, with their cute little wings, forgot they went to ask why another talker had been locked up, and they flew to different gatherings of gatekeepers. Some of them were illegal under the laws of the land; but did it matter? The blacksmith had given them freewill, and in return, they spoke for him.
One of the friends of the gatekeepers, a well read woman in the abroad, had started a forum many years before, and like her friends, plugged into the renewed vibe that was the literary scene. The scene was a big circle of gatekeepers who were taken one after the other into dungeons by Littlefinger. While the gatekeepers focused on more important things like promoting queer arts—which, although was illegal in the country where the forum had the most impact, did not matter. The gatekeepers were apparently untouchable either because the forum wasn’t domained in the country, or because it knew the right people in the country.
This forum became an amplifier for a minority ostracised by unjust laws. The forum, owned by a gatekeeper, promised to always protect the voice of everyone, and that was what it did.
ENTER OBI-WAN:
Obi-wan was/is a dazzling little star. Obi-wan would become a gatekeeper over the years by association with older gatekeepers. ITT held the gate open for him to work with her on her forum. He worked his way up the ladder, talking about the silence and prejudice suffered by the muted in the society.
ITT opened the floor for Obi-wan to talk about the struggles of funding gatekeeping. How many gates have been locked permanently because the blacksmith who promised to make more gates ceased making them abruptly. But there was Littlefinger, who picked a gatekeeper’s friend whenever they talked too much, locked them away indefinitely, as the gatekeepers looked away. They talked about the blacksmiths they couldn’t keep, and talked little about the blacksmith that kept them—even in dungeons.
Obi-wan focused on something that mattered to him; the tender love and understanding of the queer community and the need to normalise queer relationships. His friends—the next generation of gatekeepers—were picked at will by angry citizens, beaten, molested, and they talked. They frothed from mouth to mouth about their friends. When Littlefinger picked more and more of them for talking too much, they pretended to be angry about it, then went back to what was more important. Some accused Obi-wan, and the others for making it difficult for non-queer talkers to have a voice. But in the gatekeeping business, you only worried about the people closest to the gate.
LITTLEFINGER Mrs:
While the gatekeepers moved from forum to festivals supported by Littlefinger, Littlefinger’s loving family continued to show how unimportant the voice of gatekeepers were. Mrs Littlefinger, a friend of the talkers, who herself had published her voice for the world to hear, kept close alliance with the gatekeepers. Like her husband, she shared tea with them. Like her husband, she was accommodated. Like her husband, her voice roared louder than the voice of other talkers. Like her husband, she hated another talker while she was talking. And her son, Littlefinger Jnr, was an orange from the tree. He fell very close.
LITTLEFINGER Jnr:
An insolent, intolerant, hasty, foolish, uncouth, ill-mannered, pestilent, and vile haranguing young man with more numbers than name on Twitter called Littlefinger by his first name. Not even Littlefinger Jnr, or Mrs, dared to call Littlefinger by name.
To protect the honour of Littlefinger, Jnr promised to mete justice on Numbers Man (NM), by blessing his mother’s vile body with his penis, and those of his friends. NM cried all over the timeline, but who was NM in the grand scheme of things?
Littlefinger Mrs reminded NM of his insolence when she was asked what she thought. Who was he to call Littlefinger by his true name? How dare you call a devil a devil? Mrs Littlefinger was picked up by wannabe gatekeepers and quoted out of context. The older gatekeepers. The ones who sipped tea with the Littlefinger family. They were asked to talk about Mrs, but they said it was not their place. Some didn’t utter a word.
ENTER (again) OBI-WAN:
Obi-wan waved his magical wand of words and talked about the Mrs. It was not an area he was experienced in; writing about blacksmiths who actually made gates. ITT asked him why he raised his voice at Mrs, and what did Obi-wan do? He raised his voice at ITT.
Obi-wan, 26, locked out of work, prevented from carrying placards outside his home, denied from owning any dignity, took to the internet to raise his voice once again. His friends with whom he had shared his voice echoed his resentment. It was a war. Everyone (of his friends & anyone who loved him enough) asked for ITT to close her business.
ITT TALKS:
ITT struts in to give her voice. Enamoured by her grace, penchance, valour, and flowery speech, the world was split between ITT & Obi-wan. People who spoke with the voice of ITT were called enablers of silencing voices. People who spoke with Obi-wan asked that ITT take down their voices which she had previously amplified.
LITTLEFINGER WINS:
Scheming, smiling, and smirking, Littlefinger sits in his palace, stroking his mane; Jnr on the right, and Mrs on the left. They are sitting around a little table sipping tea. They share the teary voices of gatekeepers—their friends, upcoming gatekeepers, and sympathisers— with each other. Junior laughs the loudest. He says their voices will die when they’re tired of fighting themselves. Mrs receives a notification; she has been invited to give her voice on gender based violence in a Webinar. Littlefinger stands, not more than 5ft10 tall. He starts laughing—dadada … diddidididi … yayayayayay … tatatatatata—uncontrollably at the joke Obi-wan started, and is pleased with himself that many gatekeepers do not know Obi-wan didn’t write the joke. He was only performing it."
Two thousand and twenty proverbs for a governor’s son,https://punocracy.com/two-thousand-and-twenty-proverbs-for-a-governors-son/,2020-04-17T05:23:53+01:00,"By: Godswill Elisha
It is no longer news that the first son of a certain governor, renowned in Africa (to as far away as Wuhan) for demolition than construction, got himself caught up in the crucible of a war of conquest on Twitter to determine who is the undisputed king of the land of Cyber Expletives and Ethnic Diatribes.
For the benefit of those who are not informed, he promised
a Twitter user that he would have the user’s mother gang-raped and gave a stern
warning against any form of Igbo sultry sound while consummating his most noble
intention.
I know he is a small boy and he has never had it rough in
life. Being my usual considerate self, I won’t be hard and rough on him. After
all, what an elder like me learnt from Tales by Moonlight and stealing the wise
counsels of sages, the Governor’s son cannot learn same by roaming the streets
of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the whole of the World Wide Web. As a
benevolent elder, I hereby (herein) bequeath two thousand and twenty proverbs
to guide him along his many walks on the social media and the real life.
Our ancestors said, “It is only a bastard that
points at his father’s house with his left hand.” What the governor’s
son did is more than pointing at his house with a left hand – he, in fact,
pointed at his father’s respected house with his left ear, left cheek, left
shoulder and even his two left legs. As a result, people who in the past will
not dare to look him in the eye have made themselves the judge of character,
have convicted and sentenced him to a social media life sentence without an
option of megabytes to surf the internet. I overheard some people whispering,
“Like father, like son”.
Same people have been calling his mother to resign from
one kind post that she is using to pass time. The one that pained me the most
is a comment I stumbled across the internet accusing the governor and his wife
of over-training their child. After all, is the governor not that no-nonsense
accidental public servant?
Analagbaonce admonished that “the masquerade that tries too hard to usurp his master by showing off his dance steps on the express shall be jammed by a Dangote trailer.” Our people say that “it is the desire of every father to have his son better him in life and accomplishments”. Without any iota of doubt, the governor wants his son to be better than he could ever be.
We cannot forget the governor’s provocative remark about Jesus. We also cannot forget how thegwamnatold a certain section of his citizens that they can jump from a hill and die if they are not contented with him.Haba, governor’s son, this threat of a gang-rape is another class altogether – it has surpassed all the most decent things your father has said all through his life. This is not what your father meant when he said he wants you to be better than him. See what trying to outdo your father has done to you now?
The English Wiseman, Shakespeare, in one of his plays said, “Never at ease is the head glittered by the crown”.   A governor’s son should never lose sight of the fact that he is not like any other person that walks the streets of social media. Never should you be heard expressing what is termed dog’s eloquence. Your activities won’t just be scrutinised but you will subject your family to unwanted scrutiny and contempt.
Have you not heard? – “A man who lives in a glasshouse should not throw stones.” It is a brazen display of excessive wisdom to blast Kufena rock in your glasshouse. Why denigrate another leader when your father is one, and many queries have been raised over some of his feats? I won’t speak further on this, “A word is enough for the wise” – only if his unrivalled humility would allow him to listen.
Rumours have it that a former minister has been entreating you to apologise for your expletives. Where did you get that wisdom that you must be appeased in order to apologise? Who are you forming James Bond for? Are you bigger than your mother who apologised for wrongly siding you? If by your actions, you rendered yourself a bastard by pointing at your father’s house with a left-hand, should we also doubt your maternity now that you are not taking the same path as your mother?
“The hunting dog that is destined to get lost in the forest will not listen to the whistling of the hunter.”
After all is said and done, the over-sense that is worrying me tells me that in 2041 AD, when the governor’s son wants to outdo his father by being the president, he will be forgiven by the Ibos, the expanding league of feminists, as well as the caucus of right-thinking Nigerians, and then get the requisite votes to win the presidency race. Are our votes not worth just wrappers, t-shirts, salt, rice, and false promises of better days?

UPDATE: Confirmed cases of #COVIDIOTS in Nigeria. See who made the list,https://punocracy.com/covidiots/,2020-04-16T12:14:48+01:00,"The world is at war. Not a war firearms can win, because the sworn enemy here is a virus which survives when hosted by the human body.
Since the war crossed transnational borders into Nigeria, the nation’s centre for disease control has had its work well cut out. Daily, especially at night, we sleep with the news of the number of newly recorded cases of coronavirus.
But something has always been missing from the news:Number of COVIDIOTS recorded so far. They are worse than the confirmed cases, experts have stressed. This, they say, is because the action of one COVIDIOT can bug the entire nation.
This was also surmised in President Muhammadu Buhari’s recorded speech Monday: “The irresponsibility of the few can lead to the death of the many. Your freedom ends where other people’s rights begin.”
We understand that the NCDC is unable to track all cases of COVIDIOTS while also confirming new cases of infection, so we atPunocracyare volunteering to assist with this public service as our contribution to the national response against COVID-19.
Although some named here have since recovered, we have compiled their names nonetheless for the purpose of those who might show similar symptoms in future. Here we go:
Meanwhile, please note that, like Nigeria’s social register, this list will be updated as soon as we confirm new cases of COVID(IOT)-19."
Nigeria Airways of blessed memory,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-airways-of-blessed-memory/,2020-04-16T11:22:07+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
It’s been more than four months since they told us Nigeria Airways will fly. Did someone borrow the wings?
In fact, the imaginary airline motto was:Bringing Nigeria closer to the world. I like it because it’s perhaps the only word of truth that’ll ever come out from their uncontrollably lying tongues. It seems their conscience will not let them rest; so they had to unconsciously voice out the truth. They know that Nigeria is undoubtedly and incredibly far from the world; hence, the motto.
But is it an airline that’ll take Nigeria closer to the world? I suppose the systems and institutions in saner climes are just for decoration; and their various national carriers are the ones enabling them to keep up with the increasing pace of global industrialisation. No wonder our leaders — with all their constant journey to the place — go on pilgrimage to saner climes with their eyes wide open, seeing clearly, like a wooden carved image. They return to Nigeria with plentiful conference materials, but always seem to leave the sense of implementation at the airport.
It is abrupt monstrosity and a parade of callousness at its maximum not to let a sleeping dog lie or a dead man rest in peace. Nigeria Airways is dead, but they won’t let the innocuous airline rest in peace. They still went about digging his grave in a bid to resurrect him. They didn’t even look for a miracle worker with proven track records of resuscitating things for the resurrection project; they chose Bubu, the messiah that’s always unaware. There and then, I knew the airline would die again. For it is appointed for it to die twice; after death is yet another death.
But wait, did they use Nigeria Airways to retrieve again? Because we know that some cultures in Nigeria can throw party for the success of a party they just finished throwing. You know how Nigerians will borrow funds for a full blown funeral ceremony of their great great-grandfather who died in the 19th century. They’ll say, “We didn’t have money when he died. Now we’ve made money. We have to celebrate him.”
This must be the strategy that the Nigerian airways resurrection team employed: “Let’s organise a fresh burial ceremony for the airline and use the burial funds to buy real estate in Dubai.”
It could also be that the project was too big for the Messiah to handle. You know, a dead stuff since 2003. It must have been stinking or rotten and the unaware Messiah couldn’t stress his brain to cook up creative ideas. You can’t give what you don’t have. If he transfers it to his cabinet community, it’ll still be futile;oversabican be worrying them. So, he who fights and runs away will live to fight another day: this was what the messiah did.
Meanwhile, we’ve already paid $55 million to the funeral event planners, and God knows how much the Bahrain logo designers received. All wasted and looted.
There is no way Nigeria airways will resurrect again. The horrible things they made his eyes behold when he was alive was awful. In fact, the same people trying to resurrect him now were part of those who murdered him in cold blood. They made him donate all his blood to the extent that he gave up the ghost. He initially collapsed in the 1980s, before he finally died in 2003. His autopsy report says he died of an overdose of mismanagement, corruption, nepotism, low revenue generation, regular inflation of contract sum, and kickbacks for contract awards.
The causes of his death are still very much prevalent, but in a more toxic form, yet, they were planning to resurrect him again. They said Nigeria Airways will fly by December 2019. I guess they’ve used it’s wings as  collateral for one of those loans they intend to collect. Or they’re not aware it’s already 2020.Iranu yii sha!"
A tale of two presidents and two celebrities,https://punocracy.com/a-tale-of-two-presidents-and-two-celebrities/,2020-04-16T11:21:26+01:00,"By: Godswill Elisha
It is the best of times — the age of Nigeria’s anti-corruption campaign. It is the season that Foolishness and Wisdom walked down the aisle. It is the season of 5G technology and the thousand and one conspiracy theories regarding it. It is the season where professors of Science receive science lessons from televangelists. It is said to be the dawn of a New World Order.
If my tale conveys little or no sense to you, please pardon and bear with me. It is the sign of the end times that we live in — dubbed the 5G and COVID-19 age. Nothing is making sense again as common sense has contracted the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria from a Chinese contractor, upon reporting at the facility that treats the disease, he was sent home for lack of bed space.
There was a frasidant that died,
replaced by a clone from a Savannah and placed on the presidential seat of the country
that ranks as the world’s poverty capital; with a first lady who by the words
of the frasident is only good for the kitchen and the other room.  In the country that lies to the North-East of
the poverty capital of the world rules a president. A rebel leader who stole
power and has managed to hang on to it for years despite several attempts to
take it away from him (long may hisegunguncontinue to keep away from
the express).
The story making front pages of tabloids and rendered as worship songs in the street is that while the Grand Commander of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic ( of Nigeria?)  is bragging about having technically defeatedBoko Haramover and over again and killing Abubakar Shekau again and again, the former rebel from small Chad is taking the battle to the terrorists in their hideouts and recording victory upon victory (not technical victories).
The masses of the Northeast
constituency have been heard singing,
“Sing O my soul, with all the
strength that you have
Let’s sing in praise of Chad’s gallant men of war
Bubu’s sozas kill in tens and most times only technically
L’rebelle’s boys kill in thousands and so it is,
truthfully”
It is on record that our leader from Chad led the
onslaught againstBoko Haramalongside his son. This has led to
questions regarding what the product of the venture in the other room between
the Frasidant and the First lady has been up to since his recovery from an
accident on a power bike worth the yearly budget of some countries that their
names are hard to pronounce.
In his defense, Alaye Lie-nus Muhammadu, a minister in the
cabinet of the incumbent regime who is known for disseminating alternate
truths, made it clear that this country cannot afford to bury a member of the
first family as it will batter our economy as did the sixteen years of FDF
rule. He stated further, that being a patriotic Nigerian, the first son is busy
observing the rules of hygiene, social-distancing and self-isolation as
encouraged by the government.
In another development, it has been reported that the Anthony-General of Las Gidi (not to be confused with the learned Attorney-General of Lagos State) proved to Nigeria’s only famous and foremost biz gal Funky Akin-Day-Lay (I did not say Funke Akindele) that he is a bigger celebrity than she could ever be.
Immediately after securing her conviction for desecrating
the directive of the Governor on social-distancing, he appeared before a pack of
gossip-hungry media personnel outnumbering the number that attended the party
that Funky was convicted for that morning.
Who remembers the good boy of Italian football, Mario
Balotelli? So said he, “Different strokes for different folks.” Mario’s words
capture aptly the situation that played out between Funky and A-G Las Gidi. I
hope theegungunthat is making him address such a crowd in this trying
time will not lead him to the express. Analagbaonce admonished me that
“theegungunthat tries too hard to outclass his colleague in dance
steps will soon expose hisyanshon the express road.”

Calm down! Our government can’t multitask.,https://punocracy.com/calm-down-our-government-cant-multitask/,2020-04-16T11:20:10+01:00,"You know in Nigeria, in as much as we lay blame on the government, there is a need for us to calm down, exercise patience with these saviours of ours in the persons of our government officials who swore allegiance to serve with their might. It is imperative to cut them some slack; they have families too and go through emotional and psychological issues as well.
A major reason we should be much
more patient with them is that our government officials cannot multitask. To
multitask is a big trait which only lies in the hands of the ineffective and inefficient.
Our government officials are always keen about efficiency and effectiveness,
hence they cannot handle two things at a same time.
For instance, when the pandemic emerged into Nigeria, all sectors stood up to face it, both health, security, religious, and the rest stood up to eradicate this pandemic. In order to easily deal with this Israelite plague on our Egyptian land, Nigerians were asked to sit at home, wear nose masks and bathe with hand sanitisers as these are the only requirements that will make the angel of Corona pass over our doorpost. Nigerians did all of that.
Suddenly the real pandemic emerged, hunger came greeting and brought violence along. Thieves have ravaged Ogun and Lagos; the citizens are scared, lives at stake, now they have to fight their battles themselves.
Our government is busy, the health sector is working to fight this pandemic since we have a new saviour, Boss Mustapha. The religious sectors will not come out as they are on praying mountains interceding on behalf of the nation, since it is our iniquities that have brought this plague on us. The security officials are too busy in the war against Covid-19 since it is no longer a health matter but a matter of security now.
At this point, Ogun and Lagos should better fight their battles themselves, as our officials cannot handle more than one problem and the challenge at hand is Covik-1-9; all other problems do not hold water."

Aliagan told PRNigeria that Nigerian Muslim males should be allowed to observe their compulsory prayers in mosques. He claimed that Muslims have already been endowed with a natural immune system to fight coronavirus. He stated that health officials advise people to wash their hands which Muslims do five times daily before observing their obligatory prayers. “Again, our sisters are always adorned in Hijab, some even use Niqab and gloves. So, we the Muslims already have a potent immune system against coronavirus. That is to say that we don’t have any problem.
The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, has defended the decision of the President, Maj.Gen Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), not to address Nigerians daily amid the raging COVID-19 pandemic. Adesina said on Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’ programme on Thursday that it wasn’t Buhari’s “style” to brief Nigerians. The President’s aide said this while responding to a question on why the President has not been briefing Nigerians the way other world leaders engage their citizens.
Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) leader Prophet T.B. Joshua who said the Coronavirus outbreak would end on 27th of March has suspended his Sunday Service because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The controversial Nigerian televangelist, whose full name is Temitope Balogun Joshua, claimed early this month that heavy rains would wash away the pandemic by this Friday and there would be no trace of the deadly virus. He specifically mentioned 27th of March as the day the coronavirus would disappear. “I came out at the beginning of this year saying last year will end in March and the year will continue to be very fearful till this month [March]. This month 27th, it will be over,” he had said.
It fingered irregularities in the testing process and thereby called on the Centre to conduct another round of tests forthwith. In a statement issued on Thursday, the government said all the fives cases reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 were yet to show any symptom of the virus. It alleged that the NCDC Director-General, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, was not aware of the results before the announcement.
A man named Emmanuel Benson, who had close contact with two persons that recently arrived Lagos from the United Kingdom, has been told to go home by medical personnel at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, after testing positive for Coronavirus. Benson, who had hoped to be quarantined and treated at LUTH after being tested at the government-owned hospital on March 21, was asked to go back home over lack of bed space to admit him at the facility.
He revealed that the department has been inspired to go back to the laboratory to ease the suffering of the masses through the production of hand sanitisers saying, “The hand sanitisers, which are at the experimental stage are targeted at users within the university community until it gains official approval and registration from National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) for mass production for the consumption of Kano State at the initial stage.”
“I’m a professor of science and I know how this virus moves; I know its etiology, I know it transmissibility, I know its antigenicity; because I do, I know that once you put on this mask, you have already been protected. “You don’t need social distancing when you are properly protected because your mucal glands that secretes the mucus and the musins already forms a network of coats to attack the virus,” Ayade announced to a cheering audience.
The six patients according toNigerianTribunebelong to a cluster of COVID-19 cases who recently returned to the state from Ivory Coast. Upon their return to Nigeria on Saturday, March 28, 2020, Osun state government immediately isolated the travellers at Gedu in Ejigbo. But six of them escaped from the isolation centre on Friday night.
Mr Mustapha, who is also the chairman of the Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19, said he realised how bad it was, after he was appointed to head the team. He made this known during a meeting with the leadership of the national assembly on Thursday. “I can tell you for sure, I never knew that our entire healthcare infrastructure was in the state in which it is. Until I was appointed to do this work,” he said.
Various lockdown directives by the federal and state governments in Nigeria have resulted in undesired violent incidences questioning the footing of restriction measure in the country. The stay-at-home order has resulted in a barrage of sundry violence attacks across the country in which security operatives, who are engaged to protect citizens, are fingered in most of the cases.
A six-man robbery gang has attacked two police checkpoints in Enugu State, snatching Ak-47 rifles from some policemen manning the spots. The robbers, who were operating in a tricycle otherwise known as ‘keke’, reportedly stabbed three policemen and burnt a patrol vehicle. City Round gathered that the incident took place along Enugu-Nsukka Road by Ugwuojo Nike on Tuesday, during the enforcement of the partial lockdown in the state to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic.
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Tee-Leo Ikoro, the Ondo State Police Public Relations Officer, told newsmen in Akure on Monday that the commercial motorcyclist was trying to avoid the governor’s convoy when the incident occurred on Sunday night. “There was an accident yesterday (Sunday) night in Owo where an Okada man on high speed rammed into stationary Jeep and died on the spot. It was not the convoy of the governor that killed him, the truth is that it was the speed of the Okada man that was the problem, and he rammed into the stationary vehicle and killed himself. He suddenly heard the governor convoy’s siren; he was speeding and to avoid the convoy, he rammed into a stationary vehicle (Jeep).”
President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has said Nigeria was in need of support of all international financial institutions in view of its present economic challenges. Nigeria a country with a mono product-driven economy is at the mercy of the downward slide in the price of crude oil in the international market. Receiving the new World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri, Senator Lawan said Nigeria would appreciate the support of the World Bank to mitigate poverty."
"All hail Nigeria’s new saviour, Boss Mustapha, who has risen from the dead",https://punocracy.com/all-hail-nigerias-new-saviour-boss-mustapha/,2020-04-13T10:00:12+01:00,"By: Bankole Wright
Nigeria is blessed with men of valour, warriors and saviours and small gods at different levels; from government and policy making sectors to religious organisations. We really cannot fail in this country as forces carry us in their arms.
Shall we take a moment to acknowledge one of the men of valour, Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and now chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, for rising from the dead in this period of pandemic? He has been so distant all these years, possibly six feet under the ground, that he has been innocently ignorant of the state of Nigeria’s health sector.
Now he comes, Nigeria’s knight in
shining armour, to save us. Let us give praise, glory and honour to the risen
king and saviour who has arisen to deliver us from the shackles of the deplorable
health sector and systems.
Boss Mustapha was blind to the state of the nation’s health system but now he can see. He was dead, but now has arisen. All hail the man, the saviour who at this crucial time has arrived to deliver us from a long-lasting disease, plagued by corruption and bad leadership, insensitivity and negligence.
We have found the one who is to come and deliver us from this iniquity and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. We are happy he arose from the dead at the arrival of the Chinese doctors into Nigeria. Now he will clean the threshold so the doctors can have a free pass into dealing with the pandemic called Covik-1-9.
Nigerians can all seat back and relax as our Avenger has arrived."
Dear Republic of China | Fatima Damagum,https://punocracy.com/dear-republic-of-china-fatima-damagum/,2020-04-13T09:48:30+01:00,"Dear Republic of China,
I hope this letter meets you well. If so, doxology. I have heard with one ear that the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) are angry and threatening fire and brimstone over the decision to involve you in the battle against Aunty Corona. I also heard with the other ear, that, you are coming to further disseminate the virus among Nigerians because the number of cases we have is too low. All these are rumours I picked up on the corridors of our hospital; please, nobody should come and arrest me.
My dear People’s Republic of China, don’t mind them jor! These Nigerian doctors, they are just jealous! Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, everything in Nigeria was made in China. Our engineering and medical equipment, furniture, plastics, down to the Hb pencil I used in nursery school; all were made in a large warehouse in faraway Shanghai, Guangzhou or some other exotic province that I can neither pronounce nor spell.
Now, more than 30 years later, you, China continue to lead the world in manufacturing and exportation of over a million range of products. Despite all the jokes our Nigerian comedians like to throw around about substandard products, your economy continues to wax stronger year after year further proving that it is us, Nigerians, that order and import products of inferior quality.
Over the years, the love affair between us has continued to blossom, so much so that, everywhere we turn in this country, the fruits of our union are seen, staring brilliantly back at us. See all the roads your people have constructed – beautiful! Without even a hint of a pothole! If it had been our Nigerian engineers, shey we would have all died by now? Never mind that the number of road traffic accidents attributed to bad roads are on the increase; it is not your fault! How can you take responsibility for the crazy way Nigerians drive? Are you also supposed to teach us how to drive? Haba! The work will be too much for you, let the VIO earn their wages. Take a look at the magnificent edifice that is the office of the CCECC along Airport road, Abuja. Is it not wonderful? Which Nigerian Construction company can rival that? None, I tell you.
Which brings me to the gist of this letter; rumour has it that CCECC as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is planning to dash Nigeria over 150,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE), 1.3 million face masks and plenty, plenty ventilators! Kai China! We hail you! You will do well, you hear? Your children will never fail you! Your praises will be sung in Heaven, so help me God! In this era of Buharriyya, you people are blessing us like this? Ya Salam!
Never mind those bad belle people that are bringing up stale news about World Bank blacklisting you for fraud and corruption in Nigeria. So what? Is it this small fraud that is worrying them? Corruption that even Nigerians themselves partake in? Abegi! Besides, that was in 2019. What happens in 2019, stays in 2019. Was it not a Nigerian President that said ‘corruption is not stealing’? You see? You have been vindicated!
Again, never mind these quack Nigerian doctors. What do they know sef? Is not only malaria they treat in this country? Even the chloroquine that they use to treat patients with, where do they get it from?  Yes-China! Come closer let me tell you what is worrying our Nigerian doctors: Inferiority complex. Plain and simple. They are afraid that you are coming to steal their thunder. They do not want you to shine like star beer, as you did in Wuhan.
We know that this infection originated from you people, but we Nigerians, have a forgiving spirit. We forgive you for what you have done to Italy, Spain and France. We even forgive you for what you have done to that country headed by that Blonde man who called us a ’shit hole’ country. We forgive you for all these atrocities because of our long and beautiful relationship. Except for the cancellation of the Premiership league and our yearly Umrah; I am not so pleased with that.
Anyway, I digress. The NMA is saying that they do not want Chinese doctors to come and interfere with our healthcare system. That, it is an insult to us as a country. That you people should just donate the items and leave us alone! Chai! There is God o! Since when did Nigerians start doing anything for themselves?
What is that you say? That Nigerians have highly qualified public health experts? That we are doing well so far? And so? Don’t you know that by bringing these Chinese doctors and their equipment, our health system will magically change overnight? Or do you want to deny those ministry officials the money they will use as estacode and per diem (or whatever fancy term it is called) when accompanying these Chinese people all over the country? Why are you NMA people always so uptight? We know you are qualified but are you also qualified in the art of corruption? I think not.
Besides, Chinese Medicine is better. Everybody knows. Are our people not running to hospitals in China? Or is it India? I forget. Live and let live NMA. Dear China people, we the good people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, welcome you.

Dr Chris Oyakhilome unveils a new chemical compound,https://punocracy.com/dr-chris-oyakhilome-unveils-a-new-chemical-compound/,2020-04-09T07:40:23+01:00,"By:Ọlọbẹ Yoyọn
Dr Chris Oyakhilome is one of the finest minds to come out of the continent of Africa. A child prodigy in his formative years, he completed his primary and secondary education in just four and three years respectively.
He studied industrial chemistry at the then Bendel State University (now Ambrose Alli University) and proceeded to Oxford for his PhD where he graduated with flying colours in nuclear physics.
He spent several years in academia notably at CERN (Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire) – a European research organisation that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world.
Between 1998 and 2008, Dr Oyakhilome helped in the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – the world’s largest and highest-energy particle collider and the largest machine in the world.
He left academia afterwards to become a churchpreneur, serving the God of Israel. He is a successful businessman with a net worth of $30 to $50 million (2011, Forbes) just by doing God’s work. With his wealth, he has built the most advanced private research facility in the world based in his home country of Nigeria.
It was at this research lab that Dr Oyakhilome synthesised a new chemical compound code named “NWO-ID2020” that could help stop global warming. The compound is capable of capturing the main greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) from the atmosphere!
According to the research paper submitted by Dr Oyakhilome to the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), this compound was derived from Hydro-Morono-Virohydroxo-Covid-419-5G Benzoate 4, 3, 7 Triol by passing 5G signals through it in the presence of several homogeneous catalysts — COVID-419, IOT, FEAR, SC etc. at 3000 degree Celsius and atmospheric pressure of 101,325 Pa (see the impressive chemical structure in the picture above).
Responses from world leading experts on global warming have been very encouraging. The Americans, Chinese, Russians, Europeans are awed by this breakthrough. The Nobel Prize Committees for Chemistry and Physics are paying serious attention to ascertain whether this is Chemistry or Physics.
Kudos to Dr Chris Oyakhilome for this breakthrough. He has indeed put Nigeria firmly on the global map of great scientists.

Two Nigerian self-taught Nobel laureates you probably didn’t know about,https://punocracy.com/two-nigerian-self-taught-nobel-laureates/,2020-04-09T07:29:53+01:00,"By:Ọlọbẹ Yoyọn
Professor Fẹmi Fani-Kayọde is a self-taught particle physicist and a former Nigerian Aviation Minister. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his pioneering work on electromagnetic waves in 2019.
Recently, Prof Fani-Kayọde discovered the harmful effects of 5G on mosquitoes. In his research, he demonstrated that 5G signals are capable of zapping Plasmodium parasites.
The potential for this discovery is huge. Imagine a world without malaria! Evidently, Prof Fani-Kayọde will bag another Nobel Prize for this pioneering technology.
The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine is arguably the highest distinction in biomedical research. There is no question in my mind that epidemiologists have done work worthy of such distinction as demonstrated by another Nigerian self-taught epidemiologist, Professor Dino Melaye.
Prof Dino Melaye, a former senator who became the first Nigerian to bag a Nobel Prize in medicine in 2019 for his works on influenza pandemics.
In February this year, Prof Melaye singlehandedly mapped the genome of a newly discovered moronavirus — a virus that turns human brain to jelly. He found residues of 5G signals within the RNA of this virus!
Prof Melaye presented his findings to the WHO two days ago with great accolades from eminent scientists across the globe.
Nigeria is moving forward. These two towering scientists have demonstrated that you can become a Nobel laureate by reading tarot cards and indulging in conspiracy theories.

"As healing powers take a break, famous Nigerian pastor settles for conspiracy theories",https://punocracy.com/famous-nigerian-pastor-settles-for-conspiracy-theories/,2020-04-07T08:46:34+01:00,"LAGOS (The T.A. Report)― Famous half-Indian, half-Nigerian pastor, Kiris Kilomue (read with Yoruba intonation:mi mi mi re), has discovered a brilliant way to remain in business, this newspaper has learnt, and that happens to be the age-old lucrative trick known as conspiracy theories.
We gathered that the outbreak of conoravirus and eventual lockdown appear to have also affected the Lord’s Embassy, which has since closed to requests for miraculous healing in compliance with the World Health Organisation’s stay-at-home policy.
Thankfully, God’s plan for (the) man (of God) is to prosper and not to harm him (with viral poverty) and to give him hope and a future.
This hope for continued prosperity came in the form of a powerful revelation: Nine seemingly disconnected words (NWO, ID2020, Vaccine, IoT, 5G, Embrace, Pandemic, Covd-19, and Fear) linked with nine seemingly innocent lines.
Breaking down the well-researched chart, heexplainedthat the signals from the 5G produce a sickening effect that would make people want vaccines and, eventually, the New World Order overseen by the Biblical Thannos,Antichrist.
“What is making a lot of people sick?” he asked as if people did not already know it was 5G all along.
“This is happening to them,” he confirmed. “No one is doing any research. No one cares. The politicians don’t know. They’re embracing the idea.”
Reading from a news website about the ID2020 Alliance identification project, he said, “This post was updated at 4:58pm on March 26, 2020 to clarify that the program is intended to allow people to receive vaccination and prove they have received it, not to track individuals, as claimed by some conspiracy theorists.”
“That’s a lie,” he quickly added, “it is to track individuals.”
A reliable source informed our correspondent that man did not reveal this to Pastor Kilomue, but his father in the heavens.
Meanwhile, it is worthy of note that conspiracy theories, according to the Encyclopedia Commonsensica, area type of optical illusion created through the mixture of a few ounces of facts with truckloads of rubbish for the purpose of making the proponent seem way smarter than they really are.
It has been suggested in some quarters that the clergyman’s strange outbursts might be as a result of an ill-advised change in hair relaxer.
Whatever the causative agent of this affliction is, however, The T.A. Report hereby sends love and light to the Kilomue family and wishes its breadwinner swift recovery.
We also extend our thought of comfort and condolences to former Senator Di-dn’t-no Me-lo-laye  (again, read with Yoruba intonation) who has been receiving imaginary calls from the abroad warning him about his crusade against the deadly 5G technology.
Caveat: Note that this piece is a fictional satire aimed purely at humour. The words above are nothing but products of a drunk writer’s imagination. We hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the results of anyone’s credulity or mischief. Do not take us seriously. We repeat; do not take us serious! … On second thought though, maybe you should do just that."
"Prophet Gates, rape as a weapon and other matters | Tunde Asaju",https://punocracy.com/prophet-gates-rape-as-a-weapon-tunde-asaju/,2020-04-07T07:50:17+01:00,"Nigerians are spoilsports. They spoil good things. We were just busy enjoying the rapidity with which our rulers could build health facilities when they are pushed to the wall but we’re spoiling the fun already.
All over the world, Covid-19 is granting advance tickets to showing the end of all humanity and it looks like nothing envisaged while writing wills. That blockbuster is forcing the wealthy to embrace philanthropy and the poor to seek God early.
Prophet Bill Gates is not among the usual suspects. His eminence, Bill and bella Melinda convinced themselves that a ten-figure-table wealth would serve no purpose beyond this planet. They turned in their profits early to charity. For that, the almighty hid his plans from all the seers with high falutin titles in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa and revealed the future to Gates.
In 2015, Prophet Gates warned, that World War III would not involve America’s overrated army, but would be fought in the air. Not everybody enjoys petroleum subsidy, but we all need oxygen. Like a real prophet, Gates urged global leaders to plan ahead. But like the indulgent revellers of Noah’s days, global leaders wondered – is Gates among the prophets? Someone please holla me if you find Bill Gates’ church, because I want to enrol in its school of prophecy. Anyway, Nigerians got it right, our stinking rich pastors and prophets are hiding in olive oil bottles waiting for science to tame Covid-19 so that they could resume their sham miracle services. Like the rest of us sinners, they are hiding from the shadows of the wrath of Covid-19.
Some Nigerian billionaire Gates-wannabes have jumped forward to chip in their widow’s mite even though the gap between their paper wealth and Bill Gates’ is like the gulf between Dangote and me. Finance houses and other corporate citizens have chipped in although some of the names circulating on social media are anticipatory donors. Many of them have neither pledged nor actually donated. It is not every cat that has sucked fat from the nectar of Nigeria’s wàrà ati oyin (milk and honey) that cares about planting the flowers to feed the bees. You cannot blackmail unconscionable moneybags to do what is right anymore than you can force our rulers to effective facilities for times like this. Some states have only three ventilators. Funny enough Tesla’s founder is giving free stuff but they are too shy to join the queue. To the millionaires hoarding their wealth, may their mammon keep them safe from the scourge.
Meanwhile, who says miracles can’t happen in our country? Our rulers have performed the miracle of raising clinics in record time, although some have no doctors to man them and the instruments are inadequate for a pandemic. They have a saying in Warri – at all, at all, na him bad – meaning a little is better than nothing.
President Buhari out of the immensity of our foreign reserves has announced a N20,000 reprieve for 2.6 million Nigeria’s poorest of the poor. We missed the ticket to poverty competitions but our exclusion does not invalidate the verdict of the judges or the announced prices for the winners. Besides, re-runs are scheduled for all the 36 states of the federation. The Villa has confirmed 10, 695,360 identified winners in the first few hours of the announcement. While waiting for Maryam Uwais to come out of seclusion, be kind to disaster management minister, Hajiya Sadiya Umar-Farouk and put on poorest garbs and the drone may identify and qualify you.
How you police a lockdown depends on where you are and who your ruler is. Abia’s Okezie Ikpeazu shut down his state on Wednesday with orders to anyone trying to escape isolation centres to be shot. The distance between Umuahia and Warri is close to 300 kilometres, but it was there that Ikpeazu’s orders claimed its first victim. In Warri, armed soldiers killed a Covid-19 curfew breaker leading to riots. Military authorities denied the killing but immediately released phone numbers to ‘report any unprofessional conduct by Nigerian Army personnel during the Covid-19 lockdown’.
A video of people dressed in military gear circulated widely. It contained threats over the death of one soldier. In it, the speakers threatened Delta women with rape and deliberate HIV infection as weapons of retribution. The soldiers in the video are of course; unknown soldiers!
Rape is not a new weapon of intimidation. In Lokoja, Kogi State, Abdulmumin Ganga, the State Commissioner for Water Resources, reportedly kidnapped young Elizabeth. By her own account, she was driven to Lokoja where the Commissioner ordered her to be mercilessly beaten, then stripped naked. She was videoed naked, begging for mercy with threats of the video being released. Subsequently she was driven to a hotel where the commissioner allegedly raped her.
A Kogi government statement on the matter promised ‘an investigation’ while Ganga the culprit remains on his seat. With the sad history of violence targeted at women in Kogi, from burning a woman in her own home to burning opposition party headquarters and incessantly harassing opposition figure Natasha Akpoti, take the promise with a pinch of salt. After all, Nigeria is NOT a jungle!

The subtle art of begging,https://punocracy.com/the-subtle-art-of-begging/,2020-04-04T09:53:55+01:00,"By: Maryam Olajide
The need to possess employability skills in Nigeria is not only necessary but of great benefit. Online courses are one of the ways of acquiring these skills. According to the Centre for the Study of the Economies of Africa, the labour market in Nigeria is characterised by a significant mismatch between skills demanded by employers and those possessed by young prospective workers. This means that merely having skills is not enough, but having the  right one.
The Nigerian Ministry of Finance, being a pace-setter, has taken advantage of the Udemy free online course to earn a certificate inContent-Begging and Fund Solicitation. These are some of top in-demand skills in the world right now.
Nigerian youth, however, are not only lazy but lack foresight. The only skills they have are Twitter-dragging and banters.
The goal of acquiring knowledge is to put it into practice, which was what led the Ministry of “F” to hunt for online ventilator giveaways by Elon Musk. This act is not only noble, but also commendable. Do Nigerians expect us to rely on the meagre donations from corporations and individuals? Asides that,  how well do they want us to display our certified begging skills? Through formal approaches? No now, that would ridicule our already built prestige.
Although Nigeria got at least N44 billion ($108 million) in donations from different billionaires and corporations for various forms of COVID-19 relief, these funds can never be enough, and it doesn’t matter whether we squander this money or not, it is important that we get as many ventilators as possible should the virus escalate. After that we can talk about embezzlement. Also, we have a lot of debts to settle, how else do you think we can meet up with the enormous oil price slash we gave you? You see, we have to think about Post-COVID too, being people of foresight, we’re trying to save these funds, so it doesn’t meet us unprepared.
Did you not see Ukraine, with a population of 37 million, lamenting that they have only 3500 ventilators, and are still begging for more? Nigeria with about 200 million,how many we get?
Begging is
begging, please. Don’t stress us.
It is really unfair that you guys are criticising our approach; all these things we do are for your benefits. And, as patriotic Nigerians, it is important that you emulate our steps. Begging is a life-saving skill that everyone should acquire. If our ministry can opt for online giveaways, who are you not to hustle for one? So the next time you see Sinzu Spending tweet, “Drop your account number, let me bless you with something”, please, we beg you, do not hesitate to join.
But, unlike us, do not take down your tweet. Do not be intimidated or shamed by mere bants. To beg is human, to maintain your stance is divine.

"Lockdown: SARS officials hit rock bottom, to start door-to-door ‘anti-crime’ visits",https://punocracy.com/sars-door-to-door-anti-crime-visits/,2020-04-02T08:51:56+01:00,"NIGERIA (The T.A. Report)― Officials of Nigeria’s renowned Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, have asked Nigerians to brace themselves as they prepare to take the war against crime to their doorsteps during the coronavirus pandemic.
The T.A. Report gathered that the lock-down implemented in some of the states in the country, including the FCT, has come to the special police department as a rude shock, especially as it has been denied access to its major source of Internally Generated Revenue from road users and pedestrians.
The squad’s spokesperson, Asasi Salami, told our correspondent on Thursday that they have decided to adjust with the times by engaging in a door-to-door campaign with the aim of fishing out Nigerians who are “constituting nuisance with their income or in how they make it”.
“We are glad to announce that what you have all been waiting for is about to happen. Your friendly neighborhood and highway police team will soon be commencing a grassroots, door-to-doorcampaignto improve security in our communities,” he said with a slight, hardly noticeable chuckle.
“We will be focusing our searchlight on various categories of suspects,” he continued.
“These include people with generators of different sizes and multiple kegs of petrol as they will have to explain what they need all that electricity for; people with more than two phones, especially expensive ones like iPhones; people who have tall fences and more than one exit door out of their houses; people who work on their computers while undressed or wearing flip-flops because we understand that is the trademark of Yahoo boys; and people are seen idling around the neighborhood perhaps coincidentally in search of ATMs.”
Salami said the officials have recently received valuable intelligence about a group of cyber-fraudsters camping somewhere in Lagos Island ― identified asSinzu,Spending, andJacuzzi― and plan to pay them a visit in the first phase of the operation. “But, you know, we don’t want to disclose too much about that mission so as not to sabotage it,” he added, with a broad grin.
He also said the squad has taken additional measures to equip all its operatives with disinfected POS machines and hand sanitisers.
“We, however, urge people who are showing more than one symptom of COVID-19 to place notices on their doors so that the security of our officials will not compromised,” he cautioned.
SARS is reputed as the most-trended law enforcement unit on the social media in Nigeria and also holds the record of informally prosecuting the highest number of suspected criminals in the country.

The masses thank God for Kobik One-Nine,https://punocracy.com/the-masses-thank-god-for-kobik-one-nine/,2020-04-01T11:41:48+01:00,"By: Godswill Gwanzwang Elisha
Nigeria is playing host to a new visitor. A long-awaited important visitor —  the promised one that is the desire of the masses. Kobik One-Nine was born in Wuhan for the redemption of the whole world.
Our visitor is destined to upset the present world order and usher in a new world order where the maligned, economically deprived, neglected and faceless members of the society would assume political power and transform our world into the paradise that we are often tantalised with in JW publications.
The visitor has proven to be very respectful. Upon arrival, it chose to visit the elite, the movers and shakers of our national life. It is even rumoured that the mischievous fellow visited ourreal presidentand not the continental import from that vast savannah of Sudan. The visitor did not stop with the head but has continued from one mansion to another.
Sources more reliable than the Bizinez Dey — that falsely claimed that Bubu’s regime agreed to pay all Nigerians with BVN (including members of the Nigerian Association of Lazy Youths) thirty thousand naira monthly allowances — have it that the visitor has been moving from one mansion to another in first-class settlements and that if you live in a hut it shall pass over you. The sources further have it that the elite and powerful have long left their mansions for huts in some obscure villages.
On Sunday 29thMarch 2020, my sources informed me that buoyed by the news that the visitor finally visited themaigidaof the Sir Kashim Ibrahim House, the masses in Kaduna defied the imposed curfew in Kaduna to hold a special multi-faith thanksgiving service to appreciate the almighty for finally coming to end their woes — the political elites.
They blamed the elites for constructing playgrounds and naming them schools; they blamed the government for the roads that have deteriorated into death-traps; they blamed the government for the killings and loss of properties that have become second-nature to Nigerians; they even blamed the government for Bobo-Risika (not to be confused with our beloved Bobrisky) that has been corrupting the moral uprightness of their children and transforming and confusing their genders. It is a thing of joy that the masses have finally seen the salvation of the almighty.
A visitor like Kobik is not to be trusted.
When it is done with the elites, the weed that is inspiring its actions may order it to turn its attention to the masses — the same masses that organised a special thanksgiving over its visit. It may decide to visit those tax defaulters who cry the most over our poor social amenities. When he is done slaughtering tax defaulters, it will then be the turn of those who feel too wise to obey traffic rules. The market woman who hikes the price of her commodities upon hearing the prediction of an economic recession that is likely to hit the country in six months time shall suffer the fate of the elite too.
I especially pity those who are selling nose masks and sanitisers at insane prices. They will watch us all die; grief will delay killing them and allow Kobik to finish what it has started without any of us to look after them. Are we not in the end of days?

"Baba God, we’re grateful coronavirus met us prepared",https://punocracy.com/baba-god-were-grateful-coronavirus-met-us-prepared/,2020-03-29T09:14:22+01:00,"By: Maryam Olajide
The power of prayer and gratitude can never be overemphasised, especially in Nigeria. So, Heavenly Father, we bless you for your protection over us, for opening our eyes to institute health facilities in core places prior to this pandemic, for the steps we have taken in combating this corruption-borne virus, for granting us strong immune systems, and for our foresight in writing a letter to the National Assembly about strict compliance to rules. Baba! We’re forever grateful.
O’ Lord! We do not take your blessings for granted.
Although at first, we thought this whole thing was a rumour, hence our carelessness in taking appropriate measures. You can not totally blame us for caring, for carrying out our constitutional duties, for trying to make Nigeria a better place for us all. All these were done out of the country’s, rather than our personal, interest.
It is no longer news that Abba Kyari who tested positive went to Germany to discuss one of Nigeria’s greatest challenges: power shortages, but sadly came back infected with the virus. It, therefore, means it happened while he was serving our dear country. Such a hero!
While we are aware that he should have practised self-isolation to prevent him from spreading to other people, let us also be thankful for our dear president shockingly tested negative — even though a top government source told Sahara Reporters that persistent coughing by the President raised fears in Aso Villa on Tuesday. It’s just a mild persistent cough,  nothing to worry about. It is nothing but evidence of God’s faithfulness. Baba! We’re forever grateful.
Reports have shown that a lot of you are happy with the news that other top government officials are testing positive and that you think they deserve this. May God forgive you for your lack of empathy, which they themselves have shown you in your trying times. What you don’t know is that we have a functional healthcare system in place to sustain us during these difficult days. Being people of foresight, we are already aware that our hope of foreign medical care has been dashed and it’s high time we got treatment from the healthcare centres in our respective states and constituencies.
Also, kindly disregard the information saying a source within the Presidency told Sahara Reporters that Abba Kyari was denied use of the Presidential Intensive Care Unit, after Ministry of Health officials pointed out that crisis could arise should an emergency come up around the president.You self reason am; is this possible in a place where between 2016 and 2018, N5.2 billion was budgeted for the Aso Villa Clinic, so why should he be flown to Lagos? For we have directed this fund rightly, we do not fear.
We understand perfectly what it means to not have a choice, to be stuck with the outcome of our previous decisions, to have to enjoy the standard facilities we have in place. Karma is not real, neither is it the most patient gangster ever.
May your thoughts of Coronavirus locating politicians and top-career officers come to pass only if they have in any way in the past siphoned money meant for providing quality healthcare.
Say amen,if e sure for you.

Similarities between you and the novel coronavirus,https://punocracy.com/similarities-between-you-and-the-novel-coronavirus/,2020-03-29T08:48:59+01:00,"We carry so much hate and fear as humans, that we wouldn’t walk any faster than a tortoise if our emotions were physical burdens. This reactionary phobia for novel things has blinded us from seeing the silver lining of COVID-19. Our refusal to acknowledge that this virus is like us is a subtle acceptance that it should continue to treat as us statistics; taking us down in numbers, with no regard for us as persons. Students from the Non-existent Academy of Walrus (NAW) have –after laboratory observation and research– identified the similarities between humans and COVID-19

The human need to be part of a functional family unit has kept the race moving. This intricate feature is something the COVID-19 shares with humans. As we do belong to nuclear and extended family units, so does COVID-19. Although the information gathered byLaie Internazionale (LIe)says the Coronavirus family is currently not on talking terms because of the overnight success of COVID-19, its siblings SARS and MERS are flag fliers of the Coronavirus family. Like COVID-19, like humans

2. It craves physical affection
Humans and COVID-19 are best described like Cattle egrets and cattle; both surviving on an intrinsic nature that keeps them alive. For the cattle/egret, it is feeding. For COVID-19 and humans, it is physical touch. Humans want to be touched, and when they can’t be touched, they touch themselves. COVID-19 wants to be touched and to touch as many people as possible. Like humans, like COVID-19; we all survive on physical touch.

3. It gets easily misunderstood
How many times have you had to act irrationally because you have been misunderstood… many times? I was asking COVID-19, but you seem to have answered in the affirmative. In Italy for instance, COVID-19 only wanted to play with a few thousand people at a time, but the Government thought he was only interested in the lungs of its playmates. Imagine being accused of murder when you’re only trying to help people improve their overall hygiene while having fun.

4. It wants to see the world
TheVitiligo Respondents Un Sociatelle (VIRUS)released a report in September 2019 that over 70% of people in a test involving over two million people said they would travel around the world if it was free, 20% said they would visit only a few countries, while 10% said they would rather eat Pizza from their couch.
Does this sound familiar yet? Wuhan? China? Hong Kong? South Korea? Europe? America? Africa? You want to see the world, it wants to see the world. The sad thing is, there is only space for one; humans seeing the world or COVID-19.

5. It likes filth
Just as you, the COVID-19 enjoys filth. It moves across countries flying onFilth to Filth Airways. Do youdeny your filthy behaviour? Then why is there so much dirt –and death– in the world? COVID-19 lives on this shared feature to duplicate itself across countries of the world, permeating our conscience, lungs, and lives.
Next time you want to hate the COVID-19, ask yourself if you are not hating it for something that you do too."
"T.B. Josh blames unfulfilled prophecy on shutdown, self-isolating angels",https://punocracy.com/tb-joshua-unfulfilled-prophecy-angels/,2020-03-28T08:54:08+01:00,"LAGOS (The T.A. Report)―  Africa’s third-richest Man of God, first-class miracle worker, and revered founder of the Sinagag Church of All Nations (SCAN), T.B. Josh, has provided an airtight explanation for why his famous prophecy about the coronavirus pandemic did not come to pass.
Josh had disclosed an exclusive revelation from the Almighty during a recent church service foretelling the end of COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the virus.
“This month, 27th, it will be over. By the end of this month, whether we like it or not, no matter the medicine they have produced to cure whatever, it will go the way it came,” Uncle Joshhad said.
“If it is not medicine that brought this to the world, medicine cannot take it out. It will go the way it came. My concern now is not you; my concern is about your career. You can’t travel freely, you can’t go freely. I know many places you do businesses, you can’t go there.
“This March, from now till that 27th, you have to be in an attitude of prayer. The rain I talked about will continue today, tomorrow, and it will just continue. In the night, you will see what will happen.”
In a press statement released on Saturday, however, the Man of God said, first of all, the prophecy was provisional as people were urged to be in an attitude of prayer, and that sadly the postponement of church services across the country has prevented this from happening.
“Also, you have to understand that the few supplications that were made could not be delivered to Heaven’s post office for two reasons. One, the airports are on partial shutdown and only medical supplies are currently being admitted up there. Second, I’ve been told most of the Angels are currently self-isolating. Only those performing essential services such as carrying the Almighty’s throne and singing his praises are still working.”
“We certainly did not expect all that to happen,” he added.
The press statement nonetheless, some members of the Sinagog Church have started reporting that they were miraculously cured of COVID-19 on Friday, March 27 ― exactly as prophesied.
“Since Monday, I’ve been having dry cough and my whole body has been shaking like someone possessed by the devil,” Dickson Odewale, a devoted member of SCAN, recounted. “But at exactly 12 midday on Friday, I became healed again. I did not go to the hospital. I did not call NCDC. I did not take drugs. I was cured, just like that. Hallelujah! Hallelujah!”
Another member of the church, who asked to be identified as Jesus Baby Nwachukwu, said on Thursday she shook hands with no less than 15 people infected with coronavirus, and then the following day she took an online test and, “praise be to God”, was told she was negative.
“What people need to know is that once your soul is sanitised, you don’t need hand sanitisers,” she advised.
Meanwhile, the church hasreportedly suspended church services for next Sunday and Monday at the Sinagog owing to the pandemic, which, as God would have it, has refused to exit the world stage.

"Covid-19: Nigerians hoard empathy, urge infected politicians to locate ‘nearest transformers’",https://punocracy.com/covid-19-nigerians-hoard-empathy/,2020-03-26T05:41:11+01:00,"NIGERIAN TWITTER (The T.A. Report)― In the wake of the coronavirus’s decision to paint Nigerian towns red, with particular attention paid to the infamous “corridors of power”, citizens of the country have abandoned their leaders in their time of need and, in fact, encouraged them to self-copulate.
The T.A. Report gathers that while the rest of the world practises social distancing, Nigerians have named this new trend “Emotional Distancing from Enemies of Progress (EDEP)”.
“We need to take additional precautions because of our peculiar circumstances as a country,” said William Akpe, one of the leading online advocates of EDEP, in a press statement.
“For everybody who has been victimised by the system, we certainly have some empathy. But for the politicians, we’re sorry, all we can afford is abundant apathy. Nigerians have decided to keep their empathies only for critical, genuinely heartbreaking cases of tragedy. Sadly, we don’t have enough to go round.”
Akpe added that it is because of the country’s crop of leaders that Nigerians could not afford to partake in panic-buying and all they have left to their names are some coins of empathy. “Now they want to have that too? After impoverishing and endangering us in this time of crisis? It cannot work.”
“We, in fact, urge all Nigerian politicians whom the universe has favoured in the ongoing matchmaking with coronavirus to locate the nearest transformers for their empathy,” he concluded, adding that they should remember not to touch anyone on their way to the deadly electrical devices.
Meanwhile, the politicians have decided to hoard some things for themselves too: starting with medical materials donated by the Jack Ma Foundation. Our correspondent could not confirm if this was a kind of payback or it is just a case of Nigerian politicians being themselves.
“At least 100 ventilators have been allocated to the president, and 50 to each federal lawmaker and state governor,” one source quarantining at the Aso Villa clinic told us between light coughs.
“They said they are too used to English and German medical facilities to entrust their lives to cheap Chinese products. If one fails, there have to be at least 99 others waiting in line as backup.”

May Nigeria never happen to you: The Kopid One-Nine chapter,https://punocracy.com/the-kopid-one-nine-chapter/,2020-03-26T05:40:16+01:00,"By: Adebayo AbdulRahman Adedayo
Fellow Nigerians (apologies to Apostle
Maradona),
My initial plan was to start by digging into the long, uninspiring, and commendably controversial tortoise story of how Flora Lugard, a journalist and the wife of one of our colonial masters, against our will, helped exploit our natural resources for the benefit of their country and our – no, their country again.
But the urgency of the matters at hand won’t allow me to dive into how the name ‘Nigeria’ was painfully coined because we are now at that point where we can’t establish who is presiding over the country between President Naira Marley – the ever-active Twitter tormentor, Abba Kyari – the Irunmole that eatskilishiand signs presidential letters, and General Muhammadu Buhari – the ever-smiling gentleman who introduced Kopid One-Nine Pirus without talking.
Fast forward several days without any confirmed presidential address despite various unconfirmed presidential skits on Kopid One-Nine Pirus, the baba we parade as President in Nigeria has decided to remain incommunicado.
Various calls by the netizens and Twitterati of the social media sphere have gone straight into voicemail, and messages sent to his official line were delivered but not replied.
It’s like calling the official phone number of God when you need him to direct you, but God decides to sit in a clothed rock, looking straight at you eyeball-to-eyeball, and smiling at your predicament with a mask covering his nose.
But when I pray or urge you to pray that ‘may Nigeria never happen to you’, you might be doubting what I mean, the same way you doubted the false – no, first case of coronavirus but believed the first – no, false presidential announcement on coronavirus not knowing it was a speech by the Parosident to declare the discovery of Kopid One-Nine Pirus.
The issue is that if Nigeria should happen to you, if the governor of a state makes a mistake that can make the life of millions never remain the same, some people will defend him saying he has the constituted authority to pour new waters in the land as an ‘omi tuntun’. If the governor now apologises, those people will not only celebrate him, they will also write a long essay to congratulate him on a well-delivered apology speech.
See, if Nigeria should happen to you, you will know the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus – an imported disease, in your country but the statistics of people already infected by the locally made pirus, Kopid One-Nine, will be unknown to everyone including the man who claims he is working with the ministry of health to solve it.
Are you confused? Obviously not, because an
attempt to get yourself tested to know if you have been infected by coronavirus
can in a cheetah-like speed be declined just because you don’t have a travel
history. In other words, only those with international passports have the
exclusive right to know if they have been infected by the international virus.
Wait for it: If Nigeria should happen to you, you will have only five pregnancy test strips to confirm whether any of your about 200 million patients are carrying a Chinese-made virus or a Nigerian-made pirus.
So fellow Nigerians, in a bid to ensure we don’t get infected by any of the great attributes of the word ‘Nigeria’, we must ensure that we keep praying to the almighty that may Nigeria never happen to us.
In fact, anytime we pray for our dear country in this period of public or self-isolation (as the case may be), we must remember to pray that ‘may Nigeria never happen to Nigeria’ because if that should happen, we would end up having a president hiding from his people because he is yet to conclude his classes on how to correctly pronounce coronavirus and COVID-19."
"COVID-19: Nigerians’ refusal to say please, the genesis of Buhari’s silence",https://punocracy.com/nigerians-refusal-to-say-please-buhari-covid-19/,2020-03-23T07:31:21+01:00,"By: Maryam Olajide
Nigerians are rude, in addition to being the most uncultured set of people God ever created. And this is reflected in the way they interact with, speak to, and address people in higher authorities. How dare they not have respect for the Parosidency? Where in the world do they see other citizens telling the government what to do during a pandemic?
Well, this could be traced to their right (sorry, privilege) to  “freedom of speech”. The existence of social media is a menace that needs to be curbed. It is one of the major mediums through which they get to flaunt this privilege. Not their fault. If the Social Media Bill had been enacted and they get jailed or punished randomly for expressing views contrary to the government, they would have learnt to conform.
The Parosident has refused to speak, unlike his counterparts in many other countries battling the virus because he hates Showoff and cheap politics. If not, what’s the big deal in setting up a press conference and having him read a prepared address to Nigerians? Even if the speech gets mixed up and does not really relate to the issue at hand. It’s not like Nigerians have choices. They can only shout and talk, nothing more.
In fact, Nigerians do not deserve to hear his voice. It’s their punishment for trying to revolt against his administration and most of his policies. Besides, he has left them in good hands. They have the NCDC and their respective state governors. He also made a few announcements on Twitter, directing them on what steps to take or avoid. What more could they possibly need?
Although the Parosident knows an address on this issue is part of basic leadership, to show empathy, give a sense of belonging to all Nigerians, but he likely won’t give it because he still hasn’t forgiven them for their disrespect. The recent gist is that he is the only one successfully self-isolating. People claim he is self-isolating from Nigerians and his responsibilities.
Well, initially, I did not want to give out this hint, but as a generous person, I’m going to spill it out. Has anyone not told Nigerians the importance of pleading? How difficult is it for them to say, “Please sir, come and comfort us with your eloquent presidential speech,” so the Parosident can address them, but no. Nigerians are a bunch of rude people who try to imitate those in developed countries, seeking accountability and enforcement of laws. For clarification, they are not your mates, they have specific traits that make them special. You all are Nigerians, always act like one!
In short, the Parosident’s refusal to address Nigerians is as a result of huge irresponsibility and pride on their part. It takes no effort to organise rallies or use freedom of speech privileges through their social media accounts to say “please”. The pandemic is totally altering their lives, schools are being shut down, most people are now required to work from home, some airport taxi operators have totally lost their means of livelihood and it’s affecting the economy generally, how then can they still insist to not say “please”?
While new cases of coronavirus were confirmed today, bringing the total number to 23 as follows: Lagos 16, Abuja 3, Ekiti 1, Ogun 2, Oyo 1, the parosidency does not want to say Nigerians are just getting started. They either have to collectively say “please” or save themselves.

The blood of Jesus is my sanitiser,https://punocracy.com/the-blood-of-jesus-is-my-sanitiser/,2020-03-22T08:53:10+01:00,"By: Emelife Uc
She came to me.
She must have heard that I am a journalist.
She walked into the shop, my mother’s shop. A friend of my mother. Sat, with her legs sprawled.
She buried her face in one of her palms, used the same palm to wipe sweat off her face. She returned it to her lap.
“Auntie, what’s wrong?” I asked.
“It’s this Corona o.”
Corona. She said Corona with a bitter loathful voice. Like he is an estranged lover. Or a man who promised her daughter marriage and left her pregnant at the altar.
“What about Coronavirus?” I asked.
“Is there like a vaccine for it?” She replied in Igbo.
I bit my tongue trying to do same. To reply in Igbo. It required going in details and I am far from adept in the command of the language.
Her phone chimed. She looked at it. It’s a call from her husband.
“Chelu! — Wait.”
She said to me. The minutes spent on the phone provided time for a mental translation to Igbo of all I had to say.
Or so I thought.
She ended the call. Placed the phone carefully in her bag, like not being gentle with it will take away the smartness of the smartphone.
I settled for English. My ineptness failed me.
“There isn’t a vaccine, neither is there a cure, Auntie. But there are some things you can do to prevent the virus.”
I literally saw her enthusiasm increase. It almost jumped out of her body.
“Gwam — Tell me.”
I did. Told her everything I had learnt on how to prevent the spread of the virus.
“Wash your hands regularly with soap but preferably sanitisers. It kills the virus immediately…”
“Gini kwanu bu sani gini?” she didn’t let me finish.
“Sanitiser,” I smiled, but almost immediately added, “It’s a hand-washing solution. You can get it in malls.”
I saw her confusion leave her and her visage unfolded.
“Avoid unnecessary contact with your face if your hands are not washed. If you want to sneeze or cough, cover your face with the arm of your cloth. Preferably, isolate yourself if you are sick…”
I went on. Listing more preventive measures. She followed it keenly. Painstakingly. Nodding at the end of every measure.
Motivated by the reception, I continued.
“Don’t go out to public places especially where there are crowds, so you don’t come in contact at close proximity with one who has the virus.”
Her expression changed. She looked at me quizzically like I suddenly stopped making sense.
“Public places? Make I no go market again? What of all the contacts I’m forced to make in the market? So I should keep washing my hands when there are many customers?”
She stood up. Walked past me. Turned.
“Uche, leave this one. The blood of Jesus is my sanitiser.”

A blind date with coronavirus | Jude Idada,https://punocracy.com/a-blind-date-with-coronavirus-jude-idada/,2020-03-22T08:36:06+01:00,"You have heard of the coronavirus. You see the news of new infections and deaths popping up all over the world. You heard that there were 12 cases in Nigeria. You also heard that someone had died somewhere in Ekiti.
At work, everyone is talking about the virus. You listen. You contribute. But still it appears so very far away from your reality. You refuse to allow the paranoia set in. As far as you are concerned, you are educated, you are young, you will take the advertised precautions but you will not allow it ruin your daily routine.
There is a vague feeling of apprehension, but not fear, so you soldier on because there is also hope. Hope that it will all blow over soon. After all, they said, it doesn’t affect black people. They also said Africa is too hot for the virus. They also said something about chloroquine being the magic drug for it.
You know chloroquine. You took it as a drug. Although it itched you, piriton helped. You reason, worse case, I will rather the itch than succumb to the virus.
So you are confident.
You call a friend and arrange to meet for lunch. It’s really hot and the humidity makes it even worse. So you choose a place with air-conditioning and good service. It is high brow. So less crowd. You reason that this should be safer as you remind yourself to practise social distancing.
You have dedicated yourself to take all reasonable precautions: You use hand sanitizer, sit a good distance from other customers, and try to avoid touching your face, though that last part is hard.
Even as you sit there and stare at the people lining up to be served at the food counter, none of them obeying the social distancing advice. Most of them touching their faces after touching the food counter. One of them actually coughing. No one else [taking precautions to maintain a safe distance] even though none of them is wearing masks.
You feel a tinge of concern. But you sit there and wait for your friend who has been caught in traffic because a part of you suspects that this whole thing might be overblown.
Finally, your friend comes in. She is flustered. And apologetic. You stand up and you hug. And then when you separate. You crack a joke.
“Ahhh, see me that should be practising social distancing o. No touching.”
“Haba, where will I carry corona from na? Me that I have used hand sanitizersotayI have nearly rubbed off all the colours from my hands.”
You both laugh. And wanting to get the meal started. You both walk over to the counter and order for food. You are both laughing and talking as they dish it out. You do not see one of the servers clean the sweat from her face with the back of her hand and then hold the plate upon which your food is being served.
You do not notice so many other oddities that are normalities in Nigeria. So you both go back to your table to eat. You sit down. And as you eat, all you talk about is the virus and the panic.
You blame the President for having not addressed the nation. You blame him for not closing the borders in time. You blame China for lying about the virus in the beginning. You blame Trump for being Trump and complicating matters. You blame this and you blame that.
But you feel somewhat safe after all you had used the hand sanitizer again just before you started eating.
What you don’t know is that ten days ago, your friend’s father was a guest of his business partner at another high brow restaurant in the same city. Where he caught the coronavirus.
He caught it from a hug and then a handshake he had exchanged from the wife of a banker who had recently returned from the United Kingdom and had disobeyed the fourteen days self-isolation request of the government. This wife was asymptomatic and therefore was not coughing or running a temperature, but had unconsciously licked her finger after eating her pounded yam andefo rirowith cutleries, when she realized a soup stain, a short while before she shook your friend’s father.
Three days after that, your friend’s father coughed into his hand before opening the door of their home to welcome your friend who had come visiting.
As you both sat there eating and talking about the virus, neither of you knew that the saliva of COVID-19 patients, who are those infected by the Coronavirus can harbor half a trillion virus particles per teaspoon, and once they cough, it aerosolizes it into a diffuse mist.
So even your friend did not realize that as she walked through the door that had been open by her father, who had coughed earlier into his hand, the breath she took actually sucked in about 32,456 virus particles, which immediately settled onto the lining of her mouth and throat. You both had no idea that these viruses have been multiplying inside her body ever since.
And as she talked with you on the table, the passage of her breath over the moist lining of her upper throat creates tiny droplets of virus-laden mucus that waft invisibly into the air over your table. Some settle on the food on your plate, some drift onto your fingers, others are drawn into your nasal sinus or settle into your throat.
By the time you extend your hand to shake good-bye and hug her, your body is carrying 43,654 virus particles. By the time you’re done shaking hands, that number is up to 312,405.
One of the droplets gets drawn into the branching passages of your lungs and settles on the warm, wet surface, depositing virus particles into the mucus coating the tissue.
Each particle is round and very small; if you magnified a human hair so that it was as wide as a football field, the virus particle would be four inches across.
The outer membrane of the virus consists of an oily layer embedded with jagged protein molecules called spike proteins. These stick out like the protrusions on a knobby ball chew toy.
In the middle of the virus particle is a coiled strand of RNA, the virus’s genetic material. The payload. As the virus drifts through the lung’s mucus, it bumps into one of the cells that line the surface. The cell is considerably larger than the virus; on the football-field scale, it’s 26 feet across. A billion years of evolution have equipped it to resist attackers. But it also has a vulnerability — a backdoor.
Protruding from its surface is a chunk of protein called angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 receptor. Normally, this molecule plays a role in modulating hormone activity within the body. Today, it’s going to serve as an anchor for the coronavirus.
As the spike protein bumps up against the surface of the lung cell, its shape matches that of the ACE2 so closely that it sticks to it like adhesive. The membrane of the virus then fuses with the membrane of the cell, spilling the RNA contents into the interior of the lung cell.
The virus is in.
The viral RNA gets busy.  The cell has its own genetic material, DNA, that produces copied fragments of itself in RNA form. These are continuously copied and sent into the main body of the cell, where they provide instructions for how to make the proteins that carry out all the functions of the cell.
It’s like Father Christmas’es workshop, where the elves are dutifully packaging out the toys on his instructions. These toys are complexes of RNA and protein called ribosomes. As soon as the viral RNA encounters a ribosome, that ribosome begins reading it and building viral proteins. These proteins then help the viral RNA to copy itself, and these copies then hijack more of the cell’s ribosomes. Other viral proteins block the cell from fighting back.
Soon the cell’s normal business is completely overwhelmed by the demands of the viral RNA, as its energy and machinery are occupied with building the components of countless replica viruses.
As they are churned out, these components are transferred on a kind of cellular conveyor belt toward the surface of the cell. The virus membrane and spike proteins wrap around RNA strands, and a new particle is ready. These collect in internal bubbles, called vesicles, that move to the surface, burst open, and release new virus particles into your body by the tens and hundreds of thousands.
Meanwhile, spike proteins that haven’t been incorporated into new viruses embed themselves directly into the host cell’s membrane so that it latches onto the surface of an adjacent cell, like a pirate ship lashing itself to a helpless merchantman. The two cells then fuse, and a whole host of viral RNA swarms over into the new host cell.
All up and down your lungs, throat, and mouth, the scene is repeated over and over as cell after cell is penetrated and hijacked. Assuming the virus behaves like its relative, SARS, each generation of infection takes about a day and can multiply the virus a millionfold. The replicated viruses spill out into the mucus, invade the bloodstream, and pour through the digestive system.
You don’t feel any of this.
In fact, you still feel totally fine. You are on the phone. You are chatting on WhatsApp. You are scrolling through Instagram. You are reading tweets and responding. You try to watch stuff on Netflix. Some you like. Some you don’t.
As far as you know, you are going about your daily activities in the best way you can while listening to all kind of tales of Coronavirus and trying to get over bothered by it.
If you have any complaint at all, it’s boredom.
You’ve been a dutiful citizen, staying at home as much as you can, while avoiding unnecessary travels, so much so that even when you have to go to work, you practice social distancing.
Apart from when you meet up with close friends and family members. Like your cousin. Who calls you and says she needs to talk. You drive over to her estate. It is gated and in an exclusive part of town.
She is at home with her husband, who is actually the reason she has called you, owing to the fact that they are having issues. But since she doesn’t want to talk in his presence, she says you both should take a walk around the beautiful, well-landscaped estate.
Before you guys go out. She dorns a face mask. You laugh at her.
“Ahhh, you own paranoia pass my own o.”
She smiles from behind it as she responds in her muffled voice.
“The fear of Corona is the beginning of wisdom. I have three children to stay alive for.”
You both walk around the estate talking. You advise her. She feels happier.When you get back to the house, you tell her you don’t want to come back into the house and will instead leave because you were so irritated by the actions of her husband. So she gives you a warm hug as you say good-bye, and you tell her it was great to see her, and you leave feeling deflated and dreading marriage the more.
What your cousin who has removed the mask inside her house and is going about the rest of her day feeling safe doesn’t know is that an hour before you came to her house, you went to the bathroom and forgot to wash your hands afterwards.
And because you didn’t, you didn’t get rid of the microscopic shit that had broken through the toilet paper as you wiped your butt. She doesn’t know that you left that microscopic shit on her hand when you were consoling her.
She has no idea that the microscopic shit you unconsciously gifted her contains 893,405 coronavirus particles. And forty-seven seconds after she had gotten into her home, after you left, she had scratched an itch at the base of her nose after she took off her face mask and just before she washed and sanitized her hands.
In that moment, 9,404 viral particles will transfer to her face. And make their way into her nose.
In five days, an ambulance will take her to one of the ultra-expensive hospitals in the city, just because she can afford it, if she couldn’t she would have been taken to the general hospitals or the teaching hospitals where help would come when she hopefully would have been diagnosed to be surviving from COVID 19 as a result of being infected by the coronavirus.
An infection you caused, without your knowledge.
Because unknown to you, you are a carrier, but it is taken longer for you to show symptoms. And since your cousin is asthmatic, her symptoms appeared faster.
You hear of her sickness. And you begin to worry. You call your other friend to tell her about your cousin. Your friend is not ill. So you are relieved. But your friend tells you that her father is gravely ill. And it is Coronavirus. She tells you that she is self-isolating. And your worry returns.
Your cousin’s husband calls you and tells you that you have to self-isolate, just like he and the children are doing because you had come in contact with your cousin. You tell him you will do it. And you do.
You shut your doors, knowing that you have enough food and resources for 14 days. You begin to pray like you have never prayed before. You promise God all sorts of things, if only He will ensure you don’t come down with COVID 19.
And as you pray. Your infected cells spew out virus particles until they burn themselves out and expire. As fragments of disintegrated cells spread through your bloodstream, your immune system finally senses that something is wrong. White blood cells detect the fragments of dead cells and release chemicals called cytokines that serve as an alarm signal, activating other parts of the immune system to swing into action.
When responding immune cells identify a cell that has become infected, they attack and destroy it. Within your body, a microscopic battle, like the warfront in the North East against Boko Haram is raging. Your immune system is leveling its Big Berthas on both the enemy trenches and its own troops.
As the carnage mounts, your body’s temperature rises and the infected area becomes inflamed.
Two days later, sitting down to lunch, you realize that the thought of eating makes you feel nauseated. You lie down and sleep for a few hours. When you wake up, you realize that you’ve only gotten worse. Your chest feels tight, and you’ve got a dry cough that just won’t stop.
You wonder: “Is this what contracting coronavirus feels like?”
You check Google again for the umpteenth time. Symptoms. You see that high temperature is one of it. You crosscheck with the list of symptoms that your cousin’s husband had dictated to you. It is there.
“Call the helpline if temperature rises above 37.2 degrees.”
You rummage through your medicine cabinet in vain and ultimately find the thermometer that had been delivered to you by the dispatch rider from the government agency in charge of the Coronavirus response. You hold it under your tongue for a minute and then read the result: 39 degrees.
“Oh my God!”
You crawl back into bed. Instead of calling the helpline that your cousin’s husband had given you. You tell yourself that it might just be the regular flu, and even if worse comes to worst, you’re young(-ish) and otherwise healthy. You’re not in the high-risk group.
You’re right, of course, in a sense.
For most people infected with the coronavirus, that’s as far as it goes. With bed rest, they get better. But for reasons scientists don’t understand, about 20 per cent of people get severely ill.
Sadly. Despite your relative youth, you’re one of them.
After four days of raging fever and feeling sore all over, you realize that you’re sicker than you’ve ever been in your life. You’ve got a dry cough that shakes you so hard that your back hurts.
Fighting for breath, still holding out for hope, instead of calling the helpline, you order an Uber and head to a private hospital. It is one of your companies hospitals and you are covered by their insurance. And as you journey in the Uber, you leave 376,345,090 virus particles smeared on various surfaces of the car and another 323,443,865 floating in aerosols in the air.
At the hospital, you’re examined and sent to an isolation ward. As doctors wait for the results of a test for the coronavirus, they administer a CT scan of your lungs, which reveals tell-tale “ground-glass opacities.”
These are fuzzy spots caused by fluid accumulating where the immune-system battle is the most intense. Not only have you got COVID-19, but it’s led to a kind of intense and dangerous pneumonia called acute-respiratory-distress syndrome, or ARDS.
But you are not alone.
There is already an influx of people infected with the COVID 19 sufferers. The cases are increasing rapidly by the hour. Panic has spread around the country.
And while they admit you, since all the regular beds are already occupied by the many COVID-19 sufferers, you’re given a cot in a room alongside five other patients.
Doctors put you on an intravenous drip to supply your body with nutrients and fluids as well as antiviral medicine. They tell you that it is the same treatment that was administered to the Italian who was the first index case and he recovered. They tell you that it has worked for others. They also tell you that Chloroquine trials are ongoing and if approval comes through, they will administer it.
Inspite of the intense itch that would come, you are hopeful.
Your family rush over to the hospital when they get the news. They cannot see you. Because within a day of your arrival, your condition deteriorates. The doctors change the treatment regimen. Somehow what worked for others is not working for you. You throw up for several days and start to hallucinate.
They give you chloroquine upon the insistence of your family, who are saddened by the death of your cousin from COVID 19. Anything to help you. It does not.
Your heart rate slows to 50 beats a minute. When a coronavirus patient in the next room dies, doctors take the ventilator he was using and put you on it. By the time the nurse threads the endotracheal tube down your throat, you’re only half-conscious of the sensation of it snaking deeper and deeper toward your lungs.
You just lie there as she places tape over your mouth to keep the tube in place. In that state, you vaguely hear that your friend’s father has recovered. You hear that your friend is still not displaying any symptoms. You hear the pleas of your family begging you to fight the disease. It comes from far off. In the voice of the nurses who flock around you. Fighting to keep you alive.
You’re crashing.
Your immune system has flung itself into a “cytokine storm” — an overdrive of such intensity that it is no longer fighting just the viral infection but the body’s own cells as well. White blood cells storm your lungs, destroying tissue. Fluid fills the tiny alveolar sacs that normally let the blood absorb oxygen.
Effectively, you’re drowning.
Even with the ventilator pumping oxygen-enriched air into your lungs. That’s not the worst of it. The intensity of the immune response is such that under its onslaught, organs throughout the body are shutting down, a process known as multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome, or MODS. When your liver fails, it is unable to process toxins out of your blood, so your doctors rush to hook you up to a round-the-clock dialysis machine. Starved of oxygen, your brain cells begin to expire.
You’re fluttering on the edge between life and death.
Now that you’ve slipped into MODS, your odds are 50-50 or worse. Owing to the fact that the pandemic has stretched the nation and hospital’s resources past the breaking point, your outlook is even bleaker. Lying on your cot, you half-hear as the doctors hook you up to an extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) machine. This will take over the work of your heart and lungs and hopefully keep you alive until your body can find its way back to equilibrium. And then, you are flooded with an overwhelming sense of calm. You sense that you have reached the nadir of your struggle. The worst of the danger is over.
With the viral attack beaten, your body’s immune system will pull back, and you’ll begin the slow, painstaking journey to full recovery.  Some weeks from now, the doctors will remove the tube from your throat and wheel away the ventilator. Your appetite will come back, and the ashen colour of your skin will change back to its rosy mahogany.
In the morning you’ll step out into the fresh air and order an Uber to take you home. And later still, you’ll meet the guy who will become your husband, and you’ll have three children, two of whom will have children of their own, who will visit you in your palatial mansion somewhere in the city, after they have left the house to marry people of their choice and bless you with grandchildren.
That’s what your mind is telling itself, anyway, as the last cells of your cerebral cortex burst in starburst waves, like the glowing algae in a midnight lagoon. In the isolation ward, your EKG goes to a steady tone.
The doctors take away the ventilator and give it to a patient who arrived that morning. In the official records of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, you’ll be recorded as Victim No. 592.

To:
The First Citizen, Humble Comrade Bolongo
From:
His Excellency, President for Life,
Supreme Field Marshall, Doctor Erugegeaye Amin the First,
Conqueror of the People’s Economic Woes
and Eternal Defender of the Final Revolution.
I write this letter to you, my dear friend, hoping it meets you in good health. I apologise for missing the celebrations for your fortieth anniversary in power. I am still recovering from the injuries that rodent inflicted on me during his failed ambush on my convoy last month. Thank goodness for bullet-proof cars.
I tell you, my friend, these rebels grow more difficult with every passing year. I thought after the last public executions they’d give up their mad craving for power. Alas, that is not the case. It tires me. I would not admit it to anyone but you, my closest friend. Do they not know I rule for them? Who else can lead the country as I can? Let them tell me, who else?
If not for my new wife, I would have lost it. Your daughter outdoes herself. And her teachers tell me she is the cleverest in the school and, possibly, the country. I might consider allowing her to go to university. But how would I survive without her? My other wives hold no interest to me. If that rodent doesn’t kill me, surely they’d be the ones to. Do you know what it is like acquiring Gucci bags for eleven women when you’re faced with international sanctions? After our last diplomat was caught trying to sneak luxury goods in, we’ve not been able to use that method anymore and are yet to find a new route. And then there’s money.
Yes, my friend, I’ve been reduced to worrying about money. It is days like these I think of my first finance minister. That man could work wonders! Truth be told, when I seized power I had no idea how to run an economy (and still don’t, hee-hee) but he stepped in and took control of the whole thing. All I had to say was, “X, come, your worthy leader needs a million-kwi.” Before I blink, the bundles would be arranged in front of me. Ah! Those were the days. Remember? I was the darling of everyone; these same people called me their messiah. Now, the Justice minister tells me spitting on my posters has become a thing. But he also assures me that when trialled, the people caught have been found to be mentally incompetent. It is a pity that that finance minister became too popular and had to go. Without your suggestion to accuse him of planning a coup, who knows what would have happened to the nation if the fool had supplanted me? Still, the idiots I have for finance ministers now keep shouting, “No money! No money!” I tell them, “Print more money! It’s my face on it, after all! How hard can it be?”
The present one is the worst. He’s telling me to privatise. Privatise? How can I privatise the People’s property? God forbid! I’d have to replace him soon. I should wait till next year, though. He’s the third to occupy the post this year. I’m beginning to have trouble remembering their names.
My friend, I tell you the past ten years have been hard for me. I see why you said it would be the most challenging. Nevertheless, I will persevere! Perhaps, I should commission a new monument of national unity? The other day, walking on the balcony at my Hilltop Villa, I realised I have failed my people. How can their leader have gold-plated cars while the public statues are done in plain concrete? At the last unveiling I did, I noticed how drab the statue looked and the designer told me it was because it was done in concrete. What do you think?
And that insect across the border, what should I do about him? He irritates me daily, even more than the rodent! He’s their darling now. Why? He says he would step down from office next year. Hmm, let’s wait until then. Do you know what he did the other day? He moved a motion to have me blacklisted during the annual meeting of the head of states of the continent. In my presence! I assembled my generals immediately. I planned to launch a full-scale attack on his country to teach him to shut his mouth, but Khalim reminded me the army is still being restructured after that continental armed forces debacle (the one where they slandered us with accusations of fielding under-aged and improperly trained soldiers, remember?).
Do you even remember Khalim? General Khalim? The one who has been with me from the beginning? I know you two have been communicating in recent times. Your daughter informed me. I hope you become friends. I can’t overstate his usefulness in my life. Everybody respects him. When I talk and they move their feet sluggishly, all he has to do is stare at them and they jump. And he’s a true patriot, that man. Yesterday, I overheard him talking to a group of soldiers. “Friends, hold on, the time of tribulation would soon be over!” And when I walked into the room, you should have seen how modest he was, denying his words. I should give him another medal. Maybe, a Gold Star for services rendered to the state.
Speaking of gold, I apologise for the delay in the latest shipment. That rodent—you see how he keeps coming up?—has been attacking the mines. You’d think the country with the largest reserve of minerals in the world would be able to shrug off disruptions caused by a ragtag band? I’m surrounded by incompetents. I might take your daughter’s suggestion and insist appointed ministers are vetted first. But we would need a legislature in place for that.
Ah, my friend, that your daughter! My new wife has strange ideas. At night, in bed, she tells me we should leave everything and run away to the Caribbean to live normal lives. She cares deeply for me, but she is a strange one. Who would take care of the people? But, my friend, I was saddened when I found out you had a falling out with her. Is it the obsession with democracy? You should know it is an age thing. Remember, no one less than my prestigious self thought it was the way to go once. Give it time, it’ll pass. I hope when next I visit, I can reconcile you both. And hopefully, the doors to your home are wide enough.
I’ve had to have them expand the ones in mine. I’ve been having difficulty passing through them. I cannot begin to describe how distressing it is for my entourage to come to a halt and wait for their leader to squeeze himself through doors.
Look at me. I intended to write congratulating you and I’ve been talking about myself. Congratulations, my friend. You must write a book detailing how you’ve managed to stay in power for so long.
Hold on, I can hear gunshots. It must be rats again. The capital is suffering from a rat infestation, and the presidential palace is not spared. I’ve told them to show no mercy in executing them.
Till we see again.
Yours in power,
His Excellency, President for Life,
Supreme Field Marshall,
Doctor Erugegeaye Amin the First,
Conqueror of the People’s Economic Woes

"Coronavirus: Groups of immune Nigerians set to assemble in mosques, churches for prayer sessions",https://punocracy.com/coronavirus-groups-of-immune-nigerians/,2020-03-21T08:56:44+01:00,"ACROSS NIGERIA (The T.A. Report)―  Millions of spiritually excited Nigerians, who are confident they are immune against the ruthless and widespread coronavirus, are getting set to converge in numbers at various religious houses across the country in spite of announcements warning otherwise.
While some mosques and churches are putting congregational services on hold, our correspondent gathered from various WhatsApp groups that these self-professedlyimmuneNigerians will be gathering for intense prayer sessions against what they have termed the “end-time virus”.
“No virus fashioned against us shall prosper, says the Lord,” a senior pastor said in one of the groups monitored. “We are children of the Most High, formed in his image, and since the Lord cannot have coronavirus, automatically we are also immune.
“This corona thing was designed by God to test our resolve and see if we remain faithful. And that is why, next Sunday, we will be having a special 10-hour long prayer session to banish every virus from this world. All spirits of coughing, sneezing, and premature death must die by fire!”
The T.A. Report understands that members of the church will be holding hands during the scheduled service and possibly standing close enough to spit directly into each other’s faces.
Some Muslims, obtained WhatsApp chats have revealed, also believe the virus outbreak is God’s way of punishing disbelieving nations and bad people in general. Dr Abubakr Imam Aliagan, a “renowned Islamic scholar”, has in fact encouraged Muslims to continue visiting mosques for prayers in their numbers since they are spiritually fortified against the plague.
“Even in France, I learnt that those that are completely free from contacting coronavirus are Muslim ladies and women who cover their face, use hand gloves and don’t shake hands with people,” henotedconfidently.
Other scholars have suggested the Zamzam, water from a popular well in Mecca, as a cure for the disease; and yet there are those who have strangely prohibited the use of hand sanitisers as a means of protection because of the alcoholic content.
Meanwhile, actual scientists who know what they are saying (with degrees from Ivy League schools and all) have maintained that the coronavirus does not respect provisions of the Geneva Conventions.
“Though in times of war, buildings dedicated to religion and charitable purposes are guaranteed immunity from attacks, surprisingly the virus does not appear to comply with or even recognise this basic international law,” said Harvey Harvard, an expert in Humanitarian Medicine.
“We, therefore, urge people to stay indoors and pray in their homes till the pandemic is finally contained.”

When Nigeria decides to isolate you,https://punocracy.com/when-nigeria-decides-to-isolate-you/,2020-03-15T11:18:53+01:00,"Badmus Sheriff
It would be a case of double isolation, getting isolated in an isolated nation. Super isolation! When you hold a Nigerian passport, you are technically isolated.
In saner climes, isolation is life, isolation is free food, meaningful freedom. In Nigeria, isolation is an empty room launched on a bed, no “tele,’’ mosquitoes are knights of the air and the heat itself can re-isolate a body from its soul.
Tell me not tales of goodwill, corona and poverty are simply two deadly partners: I just pray they don’t meet in Nigeria!
When Nigeria decides to isolate you please buy your own bread. The fact is that you must survive hunger to survive corona.  Try as much as possible to locate your space beside the “louvres’’ that you may naturally subscribe to fresh air and nature sponsored movies. Get bags of “pure water’’ and a handy bucket.
Try and get a small “tiger’’ gasoline generator and torchlight to cope with power outages. Please don’t expect any Wi-Fi. You may need to buy yourself a standing fan too (the rechargeable ones please!). Just think and prepare. Be rugged as usual!
There is no such self-isolation for a man leaving in a room and parlour (would he pack to the room while his family manages the parlour?). The housing structures in Nigeria are so poor that they rarely allow for such isolations. So, if the dreaded Corona ever comes, we remain a subject to our “ever-prepared’’ public isolation centres.

“Sanusi be careful na express you dey go…”,https://punocracy.com/sanusi-be-careful-na-express-you-dey-go/,2020-03-12T15:17:05+01:00,"The great Nigerian philosopher; Alhaji Abass Akande Obesere, the Omo Rapala 1 once postulated thus:
“Egungun be careful na express you dey go, moto go jam you, e don happen, I don tell am, moto don jam am…“
In his disambiguation of this profound piece of knowledge, Alhaji Obesere explained that this saying was intended as a warning to a masquerade from its handler to curb its excesses as failure to do so would lead to its eventual ruin. The masquerade as Alhaji Obesere pointed out did not heed its handler’s warning to be careful and as a consequence of itsaigboran, it was hit by a car and its handler was left to explain to the crowd of onlooking spectators that “he don happen, I don tell am, moto don jam am…”
The case of Alhaji Akande Obesere’sEgungunand its handler; theAtokunis directly relatable to the ongoingcovfefein the Kano emirate where theEgungunof Kano, sorry the Emir of Kano; His Royal Highness Sanusi Lamido Sanusi has just been dethroned by hisAtokun; the dollar stuffing,babarigawearing Governor of Kano State; Umar Ganduje.
On different occasions where Sanusi’sEgungunveered towards the road, his Atokun was always quick to warn him“Sanusi be careful na express you dey go” motor go jam you…” but did he listen?Baa mukutum, Ina gaskiya kaza kaza mutumin walahi metu mu bashi ne! He embarked on a jamboric display of his own making, dancing to music only he could hear. Flaunting his flamboyance, eloquence, elegance, mastery of English, deep knowledge of Economicsati be be loall of which areharamto the average northerner. Like how dare he?Egungun lasan lasan?? How dare he speak truth to power??? How dare he keep their sweet lies and speak the bitter truth????
Imagine Sanusi’sEgungun saying that Northerners should not marry children, that they should not marry more than one wife, that they should send their children to school ??? Ha!Astaghfirullah! Eewo! In fact don’t imagine,read it here for yourself.
Or that the North does not need Saudi Arabia or Iran to explain Islam to them.Oro-ko-ro.
But the act that reportedly broke the Camel’s back and made Sanusi’sAtokundesert hisEgungunand allow him enter road was the one where he said 80% of Nigeria’s poverty is caused by the North, that the north is holding Nigeria back, and that northern leaders are practically useless. Ha! TheAtokunwas finally tired of hisEgungun’sexcesses.
In the official statement released to the press following the dethronement and banishment of Sanusi’sEgungun, Governor Ganduje through the secretary to the state government Usman Alhaji stated that:
“The Emir of Kano is in total disrespect to lawful instructions from the office of the state Governor and other lawful authorities, including his persistent refusal to attend official meetings and programmes organised by the Government without any lawful justification which amount to total insubordination.”
In other words, hisAtokunwas telling the gathered public that“e Don happen, I Don tell am, motor Don jam am”…
In the aftermath of the jamming of Sanusi’sEgungunand as we pray for its quick recovery, let me gently remind us that speaking truth to authority, to the powers that be still remains a suicide mission in Nigeria. But should that deter ourEgungunfrom speaking truth to power even with the threat of motor jamming hovering always above its head? I think not.
And on this note, I leave you with the words of Baba Iyabo, the celebratedEbora of Owuto Sanusi’sEgungunin the aftermath of its motor jamming:
“It is sad because it was undeserved. It is good because you have paid the price.”
Egungunbe careful, na express you dey go…
Shalom."

Beasts of Mainland, Beasts of Island,
Beasts of creeks and Northern sands,
Let us mourn th’impending parting
Of the land on which we stand.
Mull the murmurs of the masses,
Bending backs in futile toil;
While the cabals clink their glasses,
Feeding fat from fertile soil.
Rabble-rousers raising rancor,
Cease thy cleaving bitter talk;
Tho’ our feet bear different markings
‘Tis the same path that we walk.
Brother, beat no drums of battle,
Sing no awful songs of war,
May our children tell their children
Tales of joy, not mournful lore.
Then on that day when our land quakes,
We’ll be standing hand in hand;
For we’ll reach across our fault lines
And defend this motherland.
Men of Mainland, Girls of Island
Boys of Creeks, and Eastern sons,
Let us sing for night is passing
Hope is rising with the sun!
The #BeastsofNigeria Anthem contest was announced via Twitter on June 3, 2017. Creative Nigerians were asked to compose an anthem with 5-6 stanzas that could be sung to the tune of Clementine, just like the Beasts of England one from George Orwell’s Animal Farm.

You-high authorities launch AWO 234 to teach female students punctuality,https://punocracy.com/you-high-authorities-launch-awo-234/,2020-03-07T08:58:14+01:00,"Information reaching our correspondent from credible sources is that You-high authorities have added a new course, titled AWO 234, in the university curriculum basically to address the issues of lack of punctuality among female students.
The new course will be taken by female students every second semester. Asides from punctuality, the knowledge of AWO 234 will reportedly curb cases of insecurity and theft at the female halls of residence.
The course, which was launched between yesternight and early this morning, saw close to 100 female students forsaken outside their hostel for arriving between 10:00 and 10:30 pm. It was a glamorous event as item seven (7) was highly guaranteed; after all, the girls were fed to mosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects.
The proponent of the course, Dr Guguru, the housemaster of Hawo Hall, said the course will also enhance the ladies to be good wife materials.
She was quoted as saying, “By allowing mosquitoes to feast on the ladies and opening them to danger for not being punctual, we were training them to be hardworking wives. We are building in them strength and character.”
Dr Guguru hopes other visionary housemasters would likewise force their student-residents to study that course. She is particularly delighted when thein loco parentisschool management chose to ignore the students’ pleas and cries while lauding her uncommon policy. “It pays to be wicked,” she said.
When reminded that, as a lecturer, she is on no record of punctuality, Guguru said the students are only foolish to take after her, harping that her job is not to be a role model to them.
“As a lecturer, I don’t attend lectures. Even when I do, I don’t come early. I don’t expect a reasonable student to take after my character,” she said matter-of-factly.
Our correspondents tried to get in touch with the affected students but they weren’t eager to speak. One student who managed to utter some expression amidst a blenched face only said, “SDC is real.”
Our correspondents later discovered that AWO 234 has in fact not been ratified yet by the schoolsinate. When we contacted the Vice-Chancellor, he replied that he unconcerned as what only matters to him is how to convince thesinateto grant him the opportunity to serve again.

"Coronavirus: Critics ask why Nigeria ranks behind 80 other countries, blame Buhari",https://punocracy.com/coronavirus-critics-ask-why-nigeria-ranks-behind/,2020-03-06T07:44:48+01:00,"SOMEWHERE IN NIGERIA (The T.A. Report)― The Nigerian Association of Armchair Critics and Social Influenzers, NAACSI, has … well… criticised President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for not doing enough to catch up with the rest of the world since the outbreak of coronavirus in January.
At a press conference held on Friday through a Skype conference with journalists, the association’s national coordinator, Omolatoro Orolabi, observed that while advanced countries like Germany, France, and the US have confirmed hundreds of cases of virus infection, Nigeria is still struggling to have up to three suspected cases.
“It is unacceptable!” Orolabi stressed with a genuinely concerned look as he bent towards his laptop’s mic.
“Nigeria is always at the bottom of global rankings, especially under this government, and it is high time someone said something. What is so difficult in allowing the made-in-China virus to spread? After all, our streets are already saturated with countless Chinese products.”
He added that according to figures from WorldoMetres, Nigeria isranked number 81on the list of countries with total cases and deaths as a result of coronavirus, behind even places like Senegal, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.
“There is a reason some diseases are called diseases of affluence,” he said. “Nigerians deserve better than diseases of poverty like Lassa fever and Malaria. We should make it a priority to replace them with sexier western afflictions like coronavirus, cancer, obesity, and hypertension. That’s not too much to ask, is it?”
The association, whose motto is “Oooin! Nigeria is not doing well” and whose members famously refer to themselves aspolitical naacsis, is notorious for constantly pointing out areas where the country is underperforming, overperforming, or simply just performing.
Meanwhile, records show that, very much unlike him, President Buhari has travelled abroadonly twicein 2020, one out of which was to another African country, no thanks — some secretly suggest — to the virus outbreak.

The health worker told our correspondent that the Coronavirus index case had been “very upset about the surrounding,” adding that the patient “complained of excessive heat and mosquitoes.” In an interaction with our correspondent, the health worker, who did not wear any personal protective equipment required of workers in such an environment, said, “The patient wanted to run away yesterday (Thursday). The Italian man, who seems to be an engineer, was very angry that the room where he was kept was very hot. “There is nothing there (inside the isolation ward) aside from bed and hospital locker.

Two traderswere shot in the fracas, with the police describing the shooting as a mistake. A witness said some police officers attached to Lafenwa division were allegedly pursuing some suspects believed to be ‘hardened’ criminals in the area, but were prevented by some traders. In anger, the squad reportedly opened fire on the traders. Two of the traders were hit by the bullets.
Coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, broke out in Wuhan in Hubei province of China in December. The zoonotic disease has since spread to over 25 countries, with over 73,000 infected persons and not less than 1,875 deaths. But Magu, who was commenting on the side effects of corruption, said the social vice is worse than any known disease, and is the cause of coronavirus.

At the meeting, the lawmakers were said to have rejected Nigerian brands, insisting on foreign ones, preferably imported and not locally assembled. The lawmaker said a proposal to patronise Innoson Vehicles Manufacturing, a Nigerian brand based in Nnewi, Anambra State, was rejected. The lawmaker said, “It is Toyota Camry 2020. Manga will supply 300 of the vehicles. The person who supplied the Senate will supply the remaining 100. Someone suggested Innoson. I feel he was being sarcastic. He is from Anambra.”
Hundreds of Abuja-Kaduna train passengers, including the minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, have escaped attack by kidnappers on Sunday evening. DAILY NIGERIAN reliably gathered that the kidnappers laid in ambush around Mando area and attempted to waylay the passengers, who arrived at Rigasa train station around 8:15pm. Sources said no sooner the kidnappers opened fire on the vehicles than mobile policemen and soldiers arrived the scene in armoured vehicles to disperse the hoodlums.
He revealed that Boko Haram members are everywhere in the country, including Lagos, adding that there are more across the North-east.The Army chief insisted that even though insurgency had been defeated, terrorism would remain in the country for years. He said: “We have defeated insurgency, but facing the challenge of terrorism. There is no where you will not find Boko Haram – even in Lagos here, there are Boko Hatam. In Kaduna, there are Boko Haram. There are more across the North-east. Many have been arrested here in Lagos. We have been tracking them. We arrest them and take them into custody. We must differentiate between insurgency and terrorism.”
Thereportby US Washington Post (including German TV outlet ZTE and Swiss channel SRF) disclosed that Nigeria purchased the machine but the date of purchase was not disclosed in the report. It stated that Nigeria eventually abandoned the machine in a warehouse possibly due to the Crypto machine’s complicated system. “At times, the incentives led to sales to countries ill-equipped to use the complicated systems. Nigeria bought a large shipment of Crypto machines, but 2 years later, when there was still no corresponding payoff in intelligence, a company representative was sent to investigate,” it said. “He found the equipment in a warehouse still in its original packaging,” according to the German document released to the Post.
He explained that the appointment comprises 2 Personal Assistants from each ward and 38 Special Assistants. “While the PAs are to serve as links between the lawmaker and the grassroots, the SAs would represent various special interests including women, youths, students, physically challenged and the aged through the constituency office in Bambam”, the statement read. It added that the number of aides was “part of Senator Amos’ empowerment drive aimed at reducing joblessness, youth restiveness, thuggery and other social vices.”
The Bursar of the University of Ibadan, Michael Alatise, on Thursday, shocked the members of the House of Representatives’ Public Accounts Committee when he told Committee that the University has no audited accounts as the external Auditor engaged to do it became blind on the job, which eventually resulted to his demise. This was just as the lawmakers discovered that the said blind external Auditor was still being paid retainership by the University as recent as last year.
He said, “The population of Nigeria about 200 million people and the landmass with dilapidated infrastructure especially roads support aviation businesses and air transportation in Nigeria. The local airlines must not be lazy; they should get up and develop the routes.
James Momoh, chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), says he has a dream that Nigerians will enjoy uninterrupted electricity supply one day. This is coming less than five days after the national gridcollapsed twicewithin two hours, causing blackout across the country. Momoh shared his dream with the audience at a programme on the electricity sector. “I have a dream that one day, my people Nigerians, will have power 24/7. I have a dream that Nigeria will overcome all pressures,” the NERC chairman said.
Hanan, according to Daily Nigerian, was conveyed by the Presidential jet to attend the Durbar in Bauchi on Thursday. The President’s daughter, who recently graduated with a first class in Photography from Ravensbourne University, London, was said to have been invited by the Emir of Bauchi, Rilwanu Adamu, as a special guest of honour. In photographs which have since gone viral on social media, Hanan could be seen disembarking from the plane and being welcomed by Gombe State officials. It was gathered that the durbar was specially organised to avail the President’s daughter of the opportunity to take photographs of the traditional durbar, Bauchi architecture and other cultural sites in the state.
“Jeremiah 5:6 says, ‘A leopard shall guard over their city’. Amotekun is mentioned in this verse with particular reference to guarding a city. Now, we have a sub-region where Muslims have been under persecution for ages coming up with a security outfit under the name of the same leopard mentioned in the bible as a guard over the city,” he said. “This is not a coincidence. The handlers of Amotekun picked the name deliberately from the bible in order to score a spiritual point. It is very critical. It calls for serious concern. So why give a security unit a religious name? We advise the planners of the new security outfit to give it another name in the interest of peace and harmony in the sub-region”
The Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, has harped on the importance of science and engineering to nation-building, stressing that soon Nigeria would join the league of countries in space exploration. He stressed that the strength of the economy of any nation was dependent on its scientific and technological advancement.  “Yes, we have that plan; don’t ever think it cannot be done, it may take 20 years, 30 years, but we have that plan and I will be very happy to see somebody from this school to go into space and you cannot do it without science and engineering.”

House of Representatives on Tuesday suspended plenary for two weeks over coronavirus. Rep. Ndudi Elumelu proposed an amendment to the prayers of the motion calling on the National Assembly to suspend plenary for 2 weeks in order to oversee what is being done to contain the coronavirus nationwide. The amendment was adopted.
According to an official of the ministry who spoke to Premium Times, lack of facilities to captures applicants’ biometrics was the bedevilling factor. Biometrics cover a diversity of unique identifiable attributes of people comprising fingerprint, iris, hand, face, voice, gait or signatures, and are used for proof of identity and verification. The anonymous source said that with the surge of insecurity and terrorism bedevilling the world at large, biometric taking has become necessary. However, Nigeria has failed to apply the technology albeit an enduring fierce battle with Boko Haram, a resilient Islamic terrorist sect that has slain thousands."
"People booing Buhari in Maiduguri ‘not even up to 100,000’, says Odesina",https://punocracy.com/people-booing-buhari-not-even-up-to-100000/,2020-02-14T11:44:18+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Nigerians are giving too much credit to the incident in Maiduguri where President Muhammadu Boohari was jeered at by residents, Special Adviser on Media Femii Odesina has said.
While addressing a group of well-fed journalists infiltrated by the T.A. Report on Thursday, the presidential spokesperson wondered why the viral footage has gathered a lot of internet dust. The video had shown mostly young residents of the Borno state capital shouting “ba mu so{we don’t want};ba mu yi{we’re not interested}” as the world’s longest presidential convoy zoomed by.
“Those were just a handful of people,” Odesina observed derisively as is his fashion. He added that it cannot, in fact, be noted with certainty that those were Nigerians in the video.
“But let’s even assume they are not from Chad or the Niger Republic and the video was not doctored by the merchants of fake news who are bent on sinking this country, how can anyone call it a protest when they are not even up to 100,000 people?” he asked.
The room fell silent, with reporters half-expecting a chuckle from the spokesman to be sure he was cracking a joke; but nothing of the sort happened.
“Let me tell you, this is a country of over 200 million people,” Odesina continued with a serious tone. “According to the Public Dissent Policy that is guiding this administration, for any gathering to be considered a protest, a quorum of at least one-third has to be formed. And if you didn’t fail Mathematics in school, you’ll know that’s about 67 million. Anything less than that is just a charade and will not be recognised.”
Odesina madesimilar remarksabout outcries following the arrest of Omoyele Sowore, convener of the Revolution Now campaign, describing the protests as the “opinion of a vocal minority”.
Meanwhile, the minister of information, Lai Machine-Ahmed, has described the shocking booing incident as an attestation to the administration’s flawless human rights record.
“I know my good friend the Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, would have captured this perfectly. The Borno incident only goes to show that the absence of freedom of speech is no longer a problem in Nigeria, it is the absence of freedom of expression that should still concern us.
“If this government were as intolerant as some people claim, those fellas in Maiduguri would by now be celebrating Valentine in a maximum-security prison far away from home or, worse, pay the ultimate price for their lack of patriotism as Saint Valentine himself did many centuries ago. But we should thank God Baba is not that kind of person.”

Only Mr President deserves the glory,https://punocracy.com/only-mr-president-deserves-the-glory/,2020-02-14T08:11:57+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
It is laughable and pitiable that the Supreme Court election tribunal has to incessantly come to the aid of INEC by helping them clean up their electoral mess. The latest show of INEC’s incompetence is the sacking of the governor-elect of Bayelsa state, David Lyon, on account of fake certificates fielded by the deputy governor-elect. How long will this sacking of candidates continue on account of petty things such as school certificates? All those amounts budgeted by INEC for elections is a waste since they have continued to show such ineptitude.
I’m not even worried about the sacking of the APC candidate. I’m worried about how anyone will boldly contest election for such a high position with fake results. What’s the duty of the party’s screening committee? Does charity not begin at home again? Or is the APC home built on sinking sand?
With all the intellectuals in their national working committee, they cannot do a simple background check on their candidates? Or is it a culture peculiar to their party? Are they only just concerned with grabbing power at all cost without plans to make an impact? They lost Rivers and Zamfara due to the incompetence of this screening committee. Now, Bayelsa? That party is indeed a great one.
Well, if that was the case, they should have thought about it twice. No one can win an election in Nigeria with questionable results except Mr President. He holds that record and he’ll never share that glory with anybody. Unarguably, the anointing flows from the top.
Butnawa o. They just spoiled the party for Mr Lyon. He has been rehearsing since last morning — under the hot sun — for what was supposed to be his big day today. From left and right, they’ve been hailing him “incoming governor!” and his head has been swelling likegarri Ijebu. Supreme Courtsef; all those marching under the sun in preparation for Friday’s swearing-in will now go in vain.Chai! All the aso-ebi his supporters bought; the fine clothes he bought for his wife and children; the joy in the air; all gone, just like that? So he will now be called “the governor Bayelsa never had”?O ma se o. They really tamed this ‘Lyon’.
But, things have gone south in this nation. Standards have been watered down and solidified at the same awful bottom. And, the citizenry is taken as fools. If not, candidates will not present fake certificates and expect to scale through INEC’s ‘rigorous process’.
The number of electoral cases before the Supreme Court is alarming and calls for questioning. What then is the job of INEC if electoral cases involving such petty aspects cannot be nipped in the bud before the elections proper? Could it be that INEC intentionally turns blind eyes to such cases? Or have they secretly received brown envelopes bigger than their responsibilities?
All of these political mess calls for a sober moment in Nigeria at large. Our electoral process is long dead and needs urgent resurrection. It has depicted little or nothing of the will of the people. Let’s not even talk about the nation at large; hasn’t it been habitable for all and sundry?"
Eat the poor to save Nigeria: My political party manifesto | David Hundeyin,https://punocracy.com/eat-the-poor-to-save-nigeria-hundeyin/,2020-02-06T06:14:08+01:00,"I was at an old friend’s wedding on Saturday, which doubled as a school reunion of sorts. There I ran into people that I had not seen in more than 12 years and we immediately started gossipping about our friends and schoolmates who were not present.
I quickly clocked that the number one reason for their absence was being based outside Nigeria. Of the entire Grange School class of 2006, we could identify three, maybe four of us who were actually in Nigeria, out of a graduating set of 40.
This particular list of old friends who have been lost to the diaspora includes medical doctors, engineers, architects, management professionals, artists, and entrepreneurs, among many others.
Afterwards, during the drive home, I decided that it was up to me to think of a radical new solution to this unacceptable brain drain problem. I decided I would need to create and put forward a political and economic solution that would be baked into the ideology of a revolutionary new political platform tentatively named Lekki Cannibals Congress, LCC.
Now – stay with me here – the radical solution that I am pitching to the world for the first time today will ensure that Nigeria’s best minds can remain in the country, thus improving the country’s economic productivity and human development indices overnight. It has one central animating ideology at its core, poor Nigerians are not really people. They are human-shaped battery livestock who inconveniently eat and take up space.
As those ordained as the un-poor by God himself, I believe it is our duty and our manifest destiny to artificially improve the quality of Nigeria’s population and thus save our dear country by cooking and eating poor people.
I need you to stay with me on this because I know what you’re thinking: Has David gone completely mad? Is he seriously suggesting targeted cannibalism as a solution to Nigeria’s problems?
The answers to both questions are no and yes, respectively. While I do not have any particular desire to taste human flesh, I effectively already do, by being on the winning side of a system that literally eats poor people. That being the case, I believe whatever is worth doing, is worth doing with our proverbial chest.
We already cook and eat poor people across every aspect of their lives as it is; so why not cut out the middleman and settle down to enjoy premium guilt-free, Poverty-Broasted Human Being? I mean we eat their livelihoods when we suddenly announce bans and restrictions on the goods and services that they trade, literally taking food out of their mouths with no plan to replace it.
We eat their quality of life and economic productivity with policy somersaults like banning Okada and keke on major roads in Lagos – something that entrenches them further in poverty by increasing their geographical immobility and thus reducing their access to economic opportunities.
We feast on poor people’s terror and insecurity when different groups of uniformed personnel rob, extort, torture, abduct and even kill them extrajudicially, while we pretend that these personnel are not acting on the orders of their superiors whom we smile and clink champagne glasses with every weekend.
We even ate their children’s future in 2019 by spending N1.149trn on opaque and economically ruinous fuel subsidies that really benefit only a few you-know-whos, leaving only N620bn for education across all levels in the same year.
Let me reiterate – last year, Nigeria spent 13 per cent of its budget on a subsidy that does little except enriching a tiny group of my un-poor brethren and sistren. In the same year, Nigeria’s estimated 93.6 million people under the age of 20 were allocated a total of N620bn for their education, which comes to about N6,623 per Nigerian student for an entire year.
Why don’t we just cut out the niceties and eat them with ketchup instead of torturing them like so? LCC proposes to do just that. I believe instead of eating poor people slowly with predatory policies and non-investment in their future, we should do the right thing and make it quick.
When we are done eating all the poor people in Nigeria, maybe then us un-poor can start to figure out how to create a somewhat equitable society.
My party’s manifesto proposes to hurry this process along so that we can start building a country instead of pretending to do so while covering our mouths to hide the delicious bloodstains. Poor people are delicious, let’s admit it.
Think about it: why were Okada and Keke banned in Lagos? Is it because they “are not part of the Lagos masterplan?” This “masterplan” includes a comprehensive commuter railway system, which a certain B.S. Hundeyin was instrumental in designing and pushing in his position as Lagos State Commissioner of Works in the ’70s and early ’80s. Thirty-seven years after my great-uncle left office in 1983 and a certain Major General Muhammadu Buhari made the disgraceful decision to end the rail project, Lagos still has no functioning rail system. And 13 years after the Lagos Light Rail Blue Line construction started, Lagos remains by far the world’s largest city without any kind of mass transit rail system – which is how come the roads are so saturated, making okada and keke a necessity by default.
Why is nobody talking about that part of the Lagos masterplan or holding someone responsible for 13 years of such miserable failure? Is it only where poor people are involved that Lagos has a masterplan? If the “masterplan” was anything to the un-poor, Parkview Estate – technically an illegal development – would not exist. It was designated by the Lagos masterplan as a natural marshland that would drain Ikoyi whenever it rains.
Today, following the wrongful development of municipal wetland into a residential estate that traps runoff water with no exit point, Parkview Estate and Ikoyi both disappear under a foot of water whenever it rains, but masterplan,schmasterplanhuh?
Deep down, we all know that such heavy-handed regulatory actions are only taken against poor people in Nigeria. Why? Because – and there is no easy way to say this – poor people’s tears, like poor people, in general, are simply delicious. The hypothetical tears of a homeowner in Parkview whose house is demolished, leaving them with only another three houses in Lekki and VI, are not as heartfelt and flavour-filled as the real tears of a homeowner in Ijegun whose house is demolished for encroaching on a perennially uncompleted road.
Let’s face it, we all love to eat poor people and their pain – if not them then who? LCC and I are here to give a long-overdue political voice to that position. LCC does not believe in pretending that banning the only form of transport that makes Lagos remotely liveable for poor people is born out of some sort of accountability. We are not pretending that the Lagos State Government and its NURTW co-travellers are not merely looking to stake their own claim in a new ride-hailing space specifically dominated by poor people.
Are we seriously going to pretend that nobody saw thousands of poor bike riders earning a dignified living for themselves and thought: “I should be making that money instead of them”? Are we going to pretend that poor people are not at their delicious best when they are helpless to stop predators from taking away their livelihoods, hopes, and dreams?
In this party, we believe that it is time to stop pussyfooting and do the needful with full awareness and zero guilt. We have been feasting on the poor for decades, pretending to regard them as humans in equal stature to us while sticking forks into them. Today LCC presents another way of doing things – a way that is transparent, fair and forward-looking.
In the event that the poor refuse to meekly submit to being eaten and they belatedly fight back when confronted with the true face of what they have always lived with, the LCC manifesto proposes that we immediately secede from Nigeria. To this end, we will napalm Third Mainland Bridge, dredge a 60-meter deep moat between Lekki and Epe, and build a border wall along Eko Bridge and Carter Bridge made out of abandoned containers and trailer carcasses from Tin Can Island port.
We will be fine in our new country, tentatively named Lekkitopia, complete with our own international airport, oil refinery and a mini Dubai sitting on the newly expanded coast of Victoria Island. LCC! Never change!
There is a possibility that some poor people may have managed to cram their way through a godawful educational system, then secured a miserable low-paying job after praying and fasting, trekked to work on an empty stomach after their usual transport was banned, and evaded uniformed predators while they were at it. Upon gratefully getting to their abusive place of employment three minutes ahead of time, thus buying themselves one more day in a job they hate, they may be reading this article using their employer’s metered WiFi connection and shaking with incandescent rage. How dare this guy compare us to farm animals?! To them, I say I’m sorry.
I have no intention of insulting you – all I want to do is join my brethren and sistren and stop being the Black Sheep. I’m tired of being the class traitor speaking out against a system that I am part of, one way or another. I have no real desire to taste Poverty-Broasted Human Being because I have lived in societies where people do well without needing to eat the poor, but I am now in Nigeria and I want to fit in.
I was at my secondary school’s 30-year anniversary gala on Saturday night and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was there. Wouldn’t it have been nice to do the smile and handshake like everyone else, instead of being the guy whose presence in the room provokes eye-rolling and nervous throat-clearing? “Who even invited him? Let him not go and use us to write an article.”
I mean it would help if you would stop acting like you want to be eaten. Maybe the next time an election comes around and the cannibal chefs present you with another predator, you shouldn’t fall for the usual ethnic dog-whistling and end up being the proverbial turkey voting for Christmas? What if the next time a predator offers you a few coins to launder their image so that they can win an election and eat your children afterwards, you choose your kids over yourself?
I realise that it is asking for a lot, but what if you would actually challenge those eating you to explain why it must always be you on the menu and never them? We’re entering the realms of fantasy here, but just imagine if instead of dancing like puppets before people who owe their entire office and power to you, you would instead treat them like the public employees they are? No? That’s asking for too much, yes?
Your ethnic and religious bigotries are stronger than your own desire for self-preservation? You’re still going to vote in favour of that bag of rice that won’t last you a week? You’d rather desperately hope for a personal miracle than take part in directed group action to stop the un-poor from eating you and your children? Your Imam or your Daddy G.O. is still going to make your electoral decisions for you instead of your conscience and common sense? What a shame. On the menu, you go. I hear poor people served with spring onions are delicious.

I can’t forget the month Of FeBuhari,https://punocracy.com/i-cant-forget-the-month-of-febuhari/,2020-02-02T09:41:35+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
There is no way Nigerians should forget this month. Not because it’s been five years of repositioning Nigeria back to its rightful place in Africa, but because my eardrums and memory keep replaying the song, chorused by well-meaning, but blindfolded Nigerians five years ago. The chants of welcome to the month ofFeBUHARI; a chant coined by Bubu supporters in a bid to sell the alleged converted democrat to Nigerians, and also to signify a new dawn for Nigeria, after — according to them — “the 16 years of destruction by the PDP.” Little did Nigerians know that, in search of solutions, they were about to get stuck with something that will make them reminisce their former state in regret.
One of my friends — a militant cum stubborn, pro-Buhari supporter  — who will never forget this month said (and this was after 2015 when hunger and suffering opened his eyes):
“During those times (2015), we didn’t let people sleep. We kept on showing them 1001 ways Bubu is the man for the job. With my sweet mouth, like a man eating beans cake, I drew people to my side, telling them why they must get their PVC and usher in the Nigeria of our dreams. Which fight I no fight finish? Me that I even organise open-air and town hall meetings with my neighbours, tutoring them about the newfound Messiah who will take Nigeria to the promised land.
“Chai, I was once blind but now I see. I sold the allegedly converted democrat to many, mobilising them to get their PVC and vote out the opposition. I didn’t know that the devil we know is sometimes better than the angel we just met. They said the former President was sluggish until they installed a man, who spent months forming a cabinet that’s not worth the wait.”
Before I proceed, welcome to the month of FeBUHARI —e shuu not be like I no greet you. We have no choice, it’s still FeBUHARI. Either we like it or not, Baba is still on the throne, and nothing might separate him from the throne till 2023, if not till Armageddonsef. However, looking back from 2015, how many people are still “Fe-ing Buhari”? My friend that I told you about is still apologising to those he cajoled into voting Buhari in. I suppose that his conscience isn’t letting him sleep. I’ve been wondering what he’s been apologising for.
If we begin to count the good things Bubu has given us after his election and reelection, we will not leave here for one full week. He has successfully increased everything that was handed over to him.
We used to know of only one terrorist organisation, Baba multiplied it to at least four. We don’t even know how to categorise the police and DSS because they operate gently and accordingly on Nigerians, leaving sorrows, tears and sometimes blood in their wake.
Under Baba, the opposition has received more blame for a present failure than we’ve ever seen. The price of PMS has increased too. Nigeria has become the world capital of poverty. More nations have placed stricter measures on their immigration policies against Nigeria. More Abacha loots have been received, but to be re-looted.
Baba has travelled more than any President we ever had. We’ve generated more kilowatts of energy than the last administration,sebi?. Corruption is now a thing of the past. The national assembly has become the most expensive rubber stamp in the world. Education has received more attention. Never in our history have we seen such a hardworking man, striving to clean the mess left by past administrations. I can keep going, listing out all the multiplication we’ve seen in five years.
As a point of fact, we’ve seen the promised land, and baba will take us there. Leave vision 2020 alone, we’ll achieve that before the year ends. Who says it’s not a good FeBUHARI to be alive? Sowore, Deji Adeyanju, Agba Jalingo, and co. can tell you how lucky Nigeria is to have Bubu at the helm.
Fortunately, there are at least three more FeBUHARIs to go. So, we’re stuck with this enjoyment. If you like, complain; we’ll force the food down your throats. Don’t tell me you want to alight from this Next Level bus. We must reach the last bus stop together. We all chartered this bus; we must suffer the accidents, unnecessary stops, flat tyre hitches, unruly passengers, and other nonsensical things that come with it.
Happy FeBUHARI!"
How to be a powerful Nigerian lawmaker,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-powerful-nigerian-lawmaker/,2020-01-31T22:25:56+01:00,"As a lawmaker in Nigeria, abusing your office and disgracing your constituency through negligent misstatements, embezzlement of funds meant for constituency projects, ignorance, inaction and non-participation in the proceedings of the house is a given.
It is expected that you be larger than life and have an over-bloated sense of ego in the discharge of your functions. Because you are powerful, your constituents grovel and beg at your feet for just a whiff of the national cake. You have so conditioned their responses that they are no longer able to think for themselves. God forbid that they concern themselves with your thoughts and contributions on non-important issues like homosexuality and abortion, you are their voice, and that is all they need to know to make Nigeria a great place for all to live in.
Now, we know you’re powerful. Even your colleagues on the floor of the legislative chambers refer to you as powerful. But it is not enough; the whole nation must know also that you’re powerful. In this wise, you must bring your 4 (four) wives and showcase them to the whole nation as evidence of your power and virility. For when a man is powerful, HE IS POWERFUL and not just for his contributions to politicking and lawmaking, but also for his prowess inthe other room.
You must hammer into the collective consciousness of the nation that you’re powerful not only because you can handle 4 (four) wives, but also because you have sired 27 (twenty-seven) children on them “and counting”. Those children, offshoots of your powerful seed; not your politicking or your lawmaking, are the clear indications that you are a powerful man and that you’re not to be trifled with.
Thus, should any man born or cut out of a woman dare trifle with you, all you need do is point to the different manifestations of your power. Do they have 4 (four) wives? Have they sired 27 (twenty-seven) children? If they have not, thenwon o le to(they are not hard enough, they do not measure up to you). Show them thisvideoandkee kee kee(laugh) at their pitiful ignorance.
Do this and as often as you please, and all will be well with you.
Shalom."
"Fellow Nigerians, shall we discuss ‘up NEPA’?",https://punocracy.com/fellow-nigerians-shall-we-discuss-up-nepa/,2020-01-27T07:31:27+01:00,"By: Adebayo AbdulRahman Adedayo
I am neither an adult nor a kid, I hang in that class of the Nigerian society where you are too young to run for any serious political office but not too young to run a political campaign by face-ing your book or tweeting a thread as a netizen of the federal republic of leopards, cows and Igbos.
But forget my age and pardon my manners because I am aMarlian. I have seen moments that have proven to me that Nigerians can be happy people. Like when Mr President declared that Boko Haram has been technically defeated or when that lousy Sowore was taught how to be a statesman in the courtroom, among others.
However, the only thing that has consistently convinced me that Nigeria doesn’t need a federal ministry of happiness to make the people happy is the way we celebrate anytime the power holding company decides to power on the electricity in our homes or places of work.
The collective way we roar‘up NEPA!’is an unforced one. It’s like our life depends on it. Actually it does because the longer the absence of power, the louder the noise when it’s finally powered on. You don’t need to be tutored on how to yell, as long as you are Nigerian, you are good to shout.
Even though some people question why we celebrate something that is constant in other countries. What they don’t understand is that it’s not about how far but about how well and what Nigerians really enjoy is the passion, the action, the zeal and the feeling they experience when they yell ‘up NEPA!’
It’s like approaching climax or sniffing cocaine; we are addicted to it. Even if it means some Albino would sit in an air-conditioned room in the Queen’s land and say we are underdeveloped or underdeveloping, that’s their problem. At least it’s our country and we have pledged to be faithful, loyal, and (dis)honest to it.
But fellow Nigerians, the thing I don’t understand is why we don’t applaud and celebrate other sectors that are faring well like our power sector. This is one thing we need to work on. We need to stop criticising other sectors or actions of the government, whether good or bad, and applaud them the way we celebrate our epileptic power supply.
For example, we need to start overlooking the few loopholes as regards the security of lives and properties. This is as a matter of urgency because, recently, some betrayers of the state have concluded preparation to transform to leopards also known as,Amotekun, all in a bid to fight cows. Ha-ha!
At least you were all there whenJagabanasked where the cows are and you could not point out the cows in your midst. Even if there are cows eating your crops and cow(ard)s killing you because of their cows, is a leopard not too wild an animal to bring into a domesticated country just to fight cows and cow(ard)s with AK47?
Another issue we need to look into is the way we criticise the federal government about the condition of our roads. The main problem we have in this regard is lack of respect because, if we have respect for adults and constituted authorities, no one would dare say that the most honourable minister of (bad) roads is a liar,haba! If we have respect for our elders and their wisdom we would never doubt the words of a legal luminary who drives the development of our roads.
A man whose contribution to real development is evident in his grey hairs and falling weight. Even if he is wrong we shouldn’t think otherwise. And, by the way, he can’t be wrong because he is Shola the son of Ifa — the Yoruba deity that says the truth at all times."

The boy who cried wolf …the untold true story,https://punocracy.com/the-boy-who-cried-wolf-the-untold-true-story/,2020-01-26T09:44:19+01:00,"You all know this tale differently, and only a part of it; an abridged version told to comfort our fear of acknowledgement of the truth, and the error of our ways. But I’ll tell you today what happened in our village in Miltonshire, England. It was a year of dread and terror.
There was a little shepherd boy named Gerald, whose mother died when he was born, and his father kicked the bucket when he was 11. Gerald’s father, William, was a strong athletic young man in his youth, and he used to stand guard for our village when marauders pillaged our harvests. He, and other young men protected us, and the village betrothed them with beautiful women whom they married. Gerald’s mother, Katherine had woollen hair, orange eyes, and her body was silken.
Gerald took his mother’s eyes, and his father’s spirit of protection. He started keeping his own sheep when he was 5, and by the time he was 7, he had a ravishing flock. William never recovered from the loss of his wife, and he fell into a great depression that lived in his heart for eleven years, before passing on.
Gerald moved to the border of our village because it was closer to the stream, and the vegetation there was lush and plentiful for his flock. Despite William’s sacrifices for the village, the village left Gerald to fend for himself, to protect himself, and to cater for his flock. Nobody looked after Gerald. Not even his Uncle Cole, who was William’s only surviving relative in the village.
As all children his age, Gerald was occasionally picked on, but boy was he tough! Only a few boys could wrestle Gerald without breaking a bone, and it made many angry Parents despise Gerald. But it made Gerald happy. Gerald did not like to be disturbed by constant bickering of people, and it nauseated him to be disturbed by parents of wimpy kids. So he stayed far away from the rest of us. He would rear his flock all summer, sell them off at the next village, disappear in autumn, and return in winter.
The devastation we speak of, happened in the summer of 1775, when Gerald was 19, and had returned to rear another flock. It was a period characterized by longer nights and shorter days, with the night sky being dominated by the howling of wolves. People shut their doors early, braced it with heavy objects to protect themselves from the howling creatures. But at night we would see a fire burning at the border of our village. Gerald, like his father, had become our protector, and kept the fire on every night to protect his flock, and inadvertently, the village.
One afternoon, Jack and Bolton, two rascals who had failed to beat Gerald as a kid, thought to play a prank on him. They went downstream to where his flock were, and gave them a chase. Gerald would have two options, to run after his flock or to chase the boys. The flock, meek and unperturbed by the madness, only moved around in circles. Gerald, sitting on a tree, saw the lunacy going on and laced his catapult with pebbles, firing at the boys. They went wild and howling into the Bush.
Determined to deal with Gerald for his insolence, they came back the next day. This time with a new plan. They would run around the village screaming wolf, and when they asked them where they saw wolves, they would say it was Gerald who told them. If they couldn’t reprimand Gerald on their own, the village would do it for them. They did set things in motion, and it worked out as envisaged. The men armed themselves to fight the wolves this one time. They hurried up to the stream where Gerald was having lunch, and talking to his flock.
The village was as shocked as he was. Nobody asked him what had happened, and they hurled cusses at him. Gerald was hurt by the accusations, and that night, he went to bed without igniting his beacon of protection. The wolves entered Miltonshire and devoured Gerald’s flock. The anger had sedated him in his sleep and it was late before he woke up to the growling in his pen.
He snuck out of his room and ran to the village under the light of the glistening moon. He ran around seeking for help, but nobody opened their doors. The village barked at him to get away with his pranks. They promised to deal with him in the morning. The wolves descended on the village, one pen at a time. Some people heard the growling wolves but knocked it off as a part of Gerald’s performance.
By the time the sun was up in the sky, the village reeked of loss and death. It was a devastation.  Some men took their own lives because they lost everything they owned. Those who lived swore to murder Gerald and set bounties for his capture. But nobody ever saw the little shepherd again. When they write about Gerald today, they write only of how he had cried wolf, but nobody ever asked him why, or gave him to explain otherwise."
How to govern Nigeria | Ali Muhammad Garba,https://punocracy.com/how-to-govern-nigeria/,2020-01-25T09:55:16+01:00,"This piece was originallypublished on Facebookon 8 January 2020.
Start with a ‘populist’ programme and make plenty of noise to affirm your campaign promises and resonate with the electorate. A bit of noisy razzmatazz on Boko Haram, funding for agriculture, some high profile arrests on corruption charges and, more importantly, painting the opposition and critics black. Hammer on the point that you are not a thief.
While this is going on, devalue the currency, remove subsidy, leverage on this to increase the national debt and, before anyone recovers from the surprise, drive hard to increase revenue. Never forget to accuse and blame the opposition, which has made your actions, correct, desirable and necessary. Remind all, that you are not a thief.
In the name of due process, shy away from politics and allow the party and other trusted persons to form the government and all its structures for you. Assure the party that you could work with anyone and anything. Once this is done, delegate authority to all and push the autopilot on. Then embark and focus on the more important issue of managing foreign matters including your personal affairs. After all, you are not a thief like ‘them’.
Accept and believe official reports presented to you by your trusted staff only. Ignore other unofficial reports and sources because they are not objective and are likely to be the work of critics and or the opposition. If you have to read and search for information in the news, focus on the cartoon section or on sponsored sections that show gratitude to you for the favours you have so graciously offered.
Use the content of official reports, which speaks on the number of Boko Haram members killed, number of people arrested on corruption charges, reduced inflation, rising foreign reserve, amount of money disbursed to farmers, etc., to praise yourself. And yes, do not ask for anything on poverty reduction. IMF and the World Bank do not use those to measure your performance.
Believe that you are the best and the only option and drive this down the throat if everyone; that you are in fact doing us all a favour by doing your best — after all, the Boko Haram insurgency is not your making; according to your intelligence reports, remnants of Boko Haram, the bandits and kidnappers are sponsored by the opposition to distract your government — and Nigerians are corrupt anyway — with the exception of you — you are not a thief. In any case, there is no time to ‘throw stone at every barking dog’. Besides, Nigerians are praying for you for your good work.
When it is time to renew your mandate, borrow and improve on what the opposition does on election matters. Promise free, fair and transparent election. Speak with solemnity in a manner similar to announcing the return of Jesus (AS) to command belief. And, in keeping with your due process belief, and that you are not a thief, allow the party to have its way and deliver your seat.
By that time, everyone would have known who you really are — an excellent book cover."
Losing the birth lottery,https://punocracy.com/losing-the-birth-lottery/,2020-01-25T09:21:44+01:00,"By: Dara Olaniyan
That Nigeria is in urgent need of some sort of help is a fact agreed on by all. Where we disagree is on the kind of help we need. Some Nigerians are of the belief that our lifeline as a nation lies in spiritual help; some believe ina lutaand the reparatory power of street protests; there are those who have opted for a more individualistic “separate and fix your own corner” approach; and there are the nihilists who just want a fully loaded gun, and the heads of a few politicians to point it at.
On whatever side of the various divides we lie, no matter the various beliefs we hold, there is still the Nigerian constant; an overwhelming frustration about the state of things, and a need to either have the problem changed or to run away from it.
On the first part of this topic [The Dire Need For Genuine National Development: Is Revolution a Solution?], it is no gainsaying that if I had twice the word limit of this essay, I could use every single word to talk about the numerous ills and problems of Nigeria our country. In fact, talking about our problems is one authentic piece of Nigerian culture that cuts across all tribes and ethnic groups. A person born in Nigeria can very easily be said to have lost the birth lottery, in terms of being born in a country where you have a high chance at proper political representation, decent social welfare, and a chance at survival.
Once you are born in Nigeria, you already have the special privilege of being a citizen of the poverty capital of the world. At this point, you must pray hard even before you can talk, so you are not one of the 4 in 10 Nigerians living inextreme poverty. If you even happen not to be at the point of birth, your prayers must not cease, lest you are one of the 6 Nigerians fallinginto povertyevery minute.
You will very likely never be able to read or write throughout your lifetime, just like the 72.5 million Nigerians whoare illiterates. If you were born female, your odds are even worse. However, do not fear if you are born somewhere up North. Just like 3,538,000 of your sisters, you will be married off as a child probably to some manfive times your age, and you can pass away in pain and agony on a poorly equipped hospital bed, as your premature body is forced to try to bring forth life.
As a Nigerian, you will very likely never have the feel of a proper hospital in your lifetime, and you had better warn your body very seriously to not contract any terminal illnesses, as neither a functioning health insurance scheme or even accessible facilities will be there to catch you. Don’t think about the fact that many Nigerians are one terminal illness away from extreme poverty, worrying is not good for your health.
You will try to get a job, but once again, the numbers are not looking very good for you. 1 in 5 Nigeriansare unemployed, and there is not much of a reason to believe you won’t be one of them. At this point, you may consider entrepreneurship, but the erratic power supply, disappearing middle class and the generally poor economy will very likely not let you get far.
If you’ve settled for just surviving and getting by, you are still not in the clear. If the bad roads don’t kill you, the police might, or maybe a political thug will, when you are on your way to the ballot box to vote for change. Such is the life of those privileged to be born into the arms of the giant of Africa.
A revolution can simply bedefined as“a change in the way a country is governed, usually to a different political system and often using violence or war” It is, in essence, a social and political movement that overthrows the current order, system or practice of governance in favour of a new one. The word “revolution” often invokes fear in the minds of many, because it is synonymous to violence, and even the quoted definition above seems to support that notion. However, “often” is not “always”, and while a level of force is needed in a revolution, it need not always be violence.
A trend can be noticed amongst many developed countries in the world, which is that a revolution is very often a step that must be taken on the pathway to development and national actualisation. The French had theirs, the British did, the Russians did, and even the Americans had their Civil War, which was a manifestation of the subtext of a revolution of sorts; a renegotiation of social rights on racial lines. However, is a revolution the solution that Nigeria needs?
The simple answer is yes. Yes, a revolution is a solution for the Nigerian situation. There is a common fact that cuts across all revolutions that have occurred in history, which is that a group of people, under the guidance, leadership or control of another- often smaller group of people, are fed up of the way things are, and feel the need to reject the current system for a better one. Nigeria checks all these boxes. We are in a country where the government has a stronghold over the economy of the nation, has held the key to several vital sectors of the economy for decades, but has constantly failed to use it for the benefit of the people.
The Nigerian political space is plagued with corruption, inefficiency, constant syphoning of funds, an abuse of the rights of citizens and a general disregard for the citizenry. That disregard for citizens, that unwillingness to answer to a higher conscience in the fulfilment of their promised duties, and that general lack of accountability or fear is exactly why it becomes pertinent for the Nigerian populace to show their displeasure through a series of decisive actions that shake the core of the current system.
I personally recommend an intellectual revolution, as history teaches us patiently that countries which are now enjoying the fruits of their labour, were those who were deliberate and intentional about charting their course for the future. These deliberate, intellectual creations which were drafted to completely change the status quo, have served as guiding voices for these countries over centuries. The British had the Magna Carta, the Americans had the American Bill of Rights, and the Swedish had the Basic Laws of Sweden.
Nigeria is in dire need of a deliberate and cerebral series of guidelines to which the country must abide. That a violent revolution is needed to give space for such an intellectual restructuring is a proposition that I neither deny nor oppose.

Nigeria and her watery standards,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-and-her-watery-standards/,2020-01-24T08:46:23+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Quality education and access to information is one key characteristic of “saner climes”; not just the road, rail, power and fight against corruption they’ve used to scam our people here. Year in, year out, the bar of education and national excellence is incessantly raised in those places.
Here, on the other hand, some key information about our own country cannot be found on the National Bureau of Statistics’ website. We have to visit an “Amrica” website to get what we’re looking for. Isn’t that how we were ignorant of the dangers of codeine use among Nigerian youth until the BBC reported it?
Some people in Aso Rock — in a bid to defend their employers’ backward competence — said, “Nigeria is a sovereign state. Foreign countries have no right to interfere in our matters”; butahn ahn!that looks like a symptom of diarrhoea of the mouth; same foreign countries you lick their boots when you need financial aid after looting the one benevolence has brought to your domain; same foreign countries you run to for medical tourism; and same foreign countries that helped expose the menace of codeine in your population?
Is it not only six signatures from the U.S. that released Omoyele Sowore from the hands of the Presidency manifesting in DSS form?Even mad man deh fear trailer nah. So, how dare they say foreign nations cannot interfere with our matters? Before you finish saying, “confere…” or “summ…”, Baba is already inside Air Force 1, especially if the venue is London. Even if na naming ceremony you invite Baba for “in the abroad”, he’ll come. Well, let’s return to the heart of this matter.
The rapper, Cardi B once said, “I do feel like if I go back to school and focus up I can be part of Congress. I dead as havesooo muchideas that make sense. I just need a couple of years of school and I can shake the table.” To put it plainly, she needs more education — not godfather, money, touts, hoodlums, and gullible devotees — to be able to contest for a seat at Congress.
She has mentally scanned through Congress and jumped to the conclusion that she needs more education if she’ll be a match for the Harvard, Oxford, Yale, and Cambridge products that are occupy the house. Why? The standard is so high. The people — whose votes you need — cannot be bought with two cups of rice, salt, maggi, and groundnut oil. Neither will they applaud any toothless promises. Those ones don’t campaign with road, light and water — they’re basic stuff every citizen is entitled to. With all the degrees my people obtain here, they still vote incompetent people into office.
When certain national standards are watered down across various sectors of a country, what will be left is the “come down to my level” mentality; a system where an accidental public servant tramples on standards — that were previously held in high esteem — to suit his ignoramus cum “village square” mentality of leadership.
Let’s come home. Who needs much education or enlightenment to be a senator? You’d better perfect your bootlicking skills, master the art of making empty promises, follow the orders of your Alpha; and you’re on your way to Abuja.
No wonder we don’t have many legislators with brilliant ideas. Their brains are so alive that only debates on cattle ranches, hate speech bill, legislators’ allowance and other drivel that are insignificant to the welfare of the masses take a large chunk of the house debates. Even Mr President,no be only affidavit we see? In recent times, we’ve seen dancing senators, drama senators, singing senators, grammar senators, and numerous other brands at the National Assembly. Yet, we want progress in Nigeria? Who employs a clown and expects progress?
The crop of public servants Nigeria had in 1999 has been the best so far, not the set of “it’s my time to eat” public servants that are currently littered all over the place. Many people in that era went back to school so they could fit in the polity; the likes of Gani Fawenmi, Fredrick Fashaun and co.; premium was placed on education and the national standard was generally high. Even OBJ went back to school. We cannot say the same now. Not even when we have an affidavit President steering the wheel. In the centre of excellence there are people of various timber and calibre, yet, only the order from the “real” state secretariat, akaBourdillonian Empire, stands. With all the number of professors, PhDs, and educated fellows; governors are still being imposed on them, year after year.
My mind is telling me they’ll call this hate speech. So, let me just conclude. Nigeria needs leaders with will, vision, and intellect across all spheres of her economy. Let’s not deceive ourselves like Nigerian leaders have chosen to; the intellectuals and technocrats stand no chance — head to head —against these moneybag politicians that have plundered our resources for themselves; however, it is the duty of the enlightened people to pave way for their emergence; to create an enabling environment for them to thrive.Abi, is it that we have so many educated fools in Nigeria?"
"Of Naija, empty barrels, and noise-making",https://punocracy.com/of-naija-empty-barrels-and-noise-making/,2020-01-23T07:26:25+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
The Nigerian state perfectly fits the Yoruba adage,“Eni ti o to kaan, to npe ara e ni meji.”Translation:He’s not even up to a “whole”, he’s calling himself “two”.
In June 1979, former West Germany Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, said about his country: “Germany isn’t a world power; it doesn’t wish to become a world power”.
At the time Oga Helmut made this statement, Germany could buy the whole of Africa, and still collect ‘change’. Germany was a force to be reckoned with in the world, then, and even now. But, because barrels full of water don’t make noise, Helmut was humble in describing his nation.
Now let’s see how an empty barrel cum the gaunt of Africa sounds:
In August 1979, the then Nigerian military head of state (I won’t tell you his name) was at his state of origin for a “Thank You Tour”; there he said: “Nigeria will become one of the ten leading nations in the world by the end of the century.”
People clapped for joy, and hopes were aroused. The petty talk had achieved its aim in the minds of the narrow-minded Nigerians. Ikukuknow that the end of that century hasn’t reached yet. Or what year is it? Help me confirm from your calendar. No! Don’t tell me we’ve passed 1999 and we’re not even among the top 20 leading nations of the world.
So, a head of state can brag like that and still fail woefully? But wait, maybe he meant top 10 leading nations from the bottom?
Ever since the inception of Nigeria, her leaders have always been full of promises upon promises, without action. We should just rename the country the Land of Promise or the Federal Republic of Dreams.
Leaders of countries that are properly administered — flowing with milk, honey and opportunities — like Nigeria are very flamboyant with their talks; they’re super-proud of the steady growth from the behind that their nation is making.
Why won’t they be proud of their country? They’ve created a lot of employment opportunities, steady power supply, access to medicine, and proper healthcare. Their rate of underdevelopment is increasingly “developing” that it has become the norm. Yet, they’re not ashamed that for decades their country is still christened “underdeveloped” with no sign of progress. Well, it’s impossible to shame the shameless.
Acts such as this are synonymous to that of the current Chief of Army Staff; he is the lead singer of the chorus, “We have defeated Boko Haram”, with numerous death tolls (on various occasions) to show for this confession. He has been sharing this testimony with his “ka sa maa dupe” (let’s just thank God) congregation since 2 to 3 years ago. He even said that all the attacks by Boko-Haram are merely a “last kick of a dying horse”.Ahn ahn, since 2017? Last kick of a dying horse?The horse no dey gree die? The one who is supposed to call him to order  — Mr President — applauded him and called a party consisting of his former cabinet in commemoration of the defeat of BH.
Nigerian leaders and their political camaraderie have medals in the pseudo-image presentation of their nation. Let’s not even talk about the current state of the nation; how people under the umbrella of integrity are using brooms to sweep the country’s resources. See, one of the manifestations of underdeveloped nations is the glamorous advertisement of their glorious poverty and abject underdevelopment.
Our leaders should move from mere talking and making empty promises to action; or else, (in VP’s voice), “we will be where we are” in many years to come."
May Nigeria never happen to you,https://punocracy.com/may-nigeria-never-happen-to-you/,2020-01-22T07:50:44+01:00,"By: Adebayo AbdulRahman Adedayo
The name ‘Nigeria’ was coined by Flora Lugard, a journalist and the wife of one the great and reportedly selfless colonial masters who, against our will, helped exploit our natural resources for the benefit of their country and our… no, againtheircountry.
In what would, later on, become a remarkably unremarkable moment in the history of our great nation, the word ‘Nigeria’ became the string that would hold together the Northern and Southern protectorates.
Fast forward several years of fast-backward
development, this country is now regarded as a great and formidable one that is
a force to reckon with in the comity of underdeveloped nations globally.
But when I pray or urge you to pray that ‘may Nigeria never happen to you’, you might be wondering what I mean considering the fact that I did not deny the intimidating attributes of a country so great it’s citizens want to leave and not live in.
However, the problem is if Nigeria should happen to you, after series of marathon-like prayers you will technically defeat your enemies; yet they would continue to deliver onto you soft bomb-like blows that would ensure you keep visiting foreign hospitals like Mr President.
See, If Nigeria should happen to you, you
would have the best result in an examination but a simple VAR review by the supreme
cult would ensure the individual who finished fourth is announced winner.
Are you confused? Obviously not, because an attempt at self-defence against cows and cow(ard)s would in a cheetah-like speed earn you the word ‘illegality’ in a state where those who arrest police are allegedly ‘legal’.
Wait for it: If Nigeria should happen to you, your father would keep visiting the United States of America for the slightest headache, but he will emphasise that irrespective of how ill you are you must not go beyond the United States of Abule-Egba in the search for a cure to your ailment — in order to save some token for national development and increase the rate of underdevelopment in the country.
If you are still not confused about why you should pray for Nigeria not to happen to you, then you need to know that if it should happen, you will be like that noisy son of ‘Yele who keeps yelling about the poor state of his country by fighting in the interest of the masses against those who are pilfering their commonwealth, yet the same masses have come out en masse to hurl at him fatal blows, rain on him abusive words, and express their disinterest in his populist interests.
So fellow Nigerians, in a bid to ensure we don’t suffer from any of the great attributes of the word ‘Nigeria’, we must ensure that we keep praying to the Almighty that may Nigeria never happen to us.
In fact, anytime we pray for our dear country, we must remember to pray that ‘may Nigeria never happen to Nigeria’ because if that should happen, we would end up having a president who is allegedly controlled by cabals and a populace that believes there is a lot of difference between the father of change and the powerful son of good-luck."
Is your country a glorified colony? A ten-point test | Chuma Nwokolo,https://punocracy.com/is-your-country-a-glorified-colony/,2020-01-20T07:00:51+01:00,"This article wasoriginally publishedon Chuma Nwokolo’s blog in February 2017.
Here’s what we think: that some African countries are still colonies. We suspect that their freedom fighters fought their way into the statehouse and finding the beds so soft and the loot so amenable, decided on a personnel change rather than the systemic change that would have truly liberated their countries. They decided to replace the colonial rulers, rather than break down the colonial system.
You cannot tell whether you live in a colony simply by looking at your constitution. Constitutions have lots of dead letters: rights that are there in writing but dead-on-delivery. To help you decide the colonial status of your country, we put together this rough-and-ready ten-point test.
1.Is your statehouse also an old people’s home?
Colonial masters cannot be changed by election. Do your Heads of State plan to die in office, to be replaced by their children? If your leadership has been in the same family since independence, if you are a thirty-year-old African who has only known one President, if your leaders are in their nineties, and are still being ‘reelected’ into office despite their incompetence, senility or corruption, you probably live in a colony.
2.Are political positions filled by ‘you the people’, or your ‘colonial masters’?
Before flag independence, political positions like councillors were filled by selection by the colonial authorities. Under modern African constitutions, they ought to be filled by elections. If political positions are decided in the living rooms of godfathers rather than via the ballot box, if your electoral systems have been so compromised that votes are irrelevant to the outcome of elections, you may be under a colonial government.
3.Are your leaders your masters or your servants?
A master lords it over you. A servant is accountable to you for your resources in his control. A servant speaks respectfully, a master, arrogantly. If your leaders behave like masters rather than servants, if they answer to humble titles like ‘Prime Minister’ (Main Servant) or ‘Comrade’ but feed with impunity on your treasury, you may have been recolonised.
4.Do your leaders prefer servile and mediocre staff?
For colonial masters, servile sycophants who will defend the status quo are preferable to intelligent, independent thinkers who may be better workers, but will likely challenge oppression. So, if your country’s cabinet seems comprised of the thickest, rather than the smartest, if your public service promotes loyal but mediocre officers over smart but out-spoken staff, who end up either fired or jailed, you may have been recolonised.
5.Is your government still in a ‘colonial partnership’ with religious leaders?
Colonial powers converted Africans to their own religions, which prioritised colonialism over independence and the treasures of Heaven over freedom on Earth. Without thus pacifying the spirit of the African, the military cost of subjugating and exploiting their physical, mental and material resources might have been unsustainable in the long run. Colonial religions implanted a concept of a colonial master-race that cannot be evicted by flag independence.
So if your religious leaders still drill unquestioning obedience into the present generation, and blame your bad roads and the fruits of bad governance on the Devil, in return for the patronage of government, the colonial collaboration between religion and government is as strong as ever, and you may be living in a colony.
6. Is your government still in a ‘colonial partnership’ with traditional leaders?
Traditional Leaders were a vital supply link in the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade. Leaders like King Jaja of Opobo who tried to stay independent were relentlessly hounded, exiled, jailed, or killed, with their kingdoms broken up or handed over to more pliable successors. The surviving traditional leaders accepted their new roles of facilitating colonialism. Indeed, in many more republican communities without traditional leaders, the colonial rulers created brand new ‘warrant chiefs’ for purpose of colonial administration.
If your present traditional leaders still collect a salary to keep their domains safe for exploitative government, then the colonial collaboration between traditional leaders and government is still alive.
7. Is your government still in a ‘colonial partnership’ with companies?
The Corporation helped to draw the map of modern Africa, and the only reason for their map and country-making activities was to profit from trade and tariffs. Companies like the British South Africa Company, the German West Africa Company and the Imperial British East Africa Company were active in the scramble for Africa. They traded in everything from ivory, enslaved Africans and African countries themselves – the Royal Niger Company sold ‘Nigeria’ to the British government for #865,000 at the end of their charter.
So, if the relationship between your corporations and government (terms of concessions, privatizations, kickbacks…) is designed to exploit society for the benefit of corporate revenues and government taxation, and at the expense of the citizens, you may well be living in a colony reconcessioned to the private sector.
8.Are your best and brightest still going abroad?
During the slave trade, millions of well-endowed Africans were abducted and shipped to plantations in the West. In the colonial era, they were shipped out as soldiers in the world wars and labourers before and after the wars.
Are your best human resources still going West?
To exploit a colony effectively, bright minds are a liability. They are most likely to ask questions, to demand self-determination. Apartheid South Africa banned and exiled her brightest independent thinkers. Colonial administrations do not prioritise superior, Afrocentric education. What they provided was western-oriented schools with a curriculum that glorified the European devastation of Africa as deliverance, and whose graduates and intellectuals could serve, as ‘supervisors of slaves’, not to apprehend history and visualize the future from an African perspective but to regurgitate a Eurocentric world view to future generations of Africans.So, is your country still hostile to intelligence? Are your schools still teaching a colonial, self-abnegating curriculum? Do they produce docile graduates fearful of authority, fit only to be ‘supervisors of slaves’? If the flower of your youth have their hearts set abroad, yours is likely a continuation of a colonial government.
9. Are your political and commercial elite above the law?
When the colonial masters chartered companies to run their African colonies, they usually exempted European citizens from the laws made and enforced by the colonial companies. This effectively created an apartheid administration with a class of super-citizens who were above the colonial law.
Are there classes in your society to whom the laws of your country do not apply? Do people who steal a goat go to jail for life, while those who steal a city get cabinet positions? If the provisions in your constitution that protect you from the excesses of your leaders are dead letters and there is one version of the law for the poor and another for the rich, you are probably the second-class citizen in a colony.
10. Is your government still corrupt?
If a democracy is a government of the people, by the people and for the people, a colonial government (of the colonist, by the colonist, for the colonist) can be considered the most corrupt manifestation of governance. Under European colonialism the corruption was institutionalized and efficient with the proceeds delivered to the main parties to the exploitation of Africa, with the ‘loot’ generally heading to Europe. The dividends of good governance can be considered the side benefits of efficient corruption, rather than the driving purpose of a colonial administration.
The Economic Commission for Africa estimates that $50 billion corruptly leaves Africa every year, double the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Africa. So, is your government a government of the clique in power, by the clique in power, for the clique in power? Is the wealth of nation still divided between the parties to the exploitation of the people, to the detriment of the people?  Are the proceeds of corruption still heading to bank accounts and properties in the West? If the answer is yes, then you have likely been colonised by a band of bandits.
GRADE YOUR COUNTRY
Failed 1-2 Tests:Well done. You are well on your way to true independence… but do take the test again to be sure!
Failed 3-4 Tests:Read the biographies of Mandela and Nkrumah and roll up your sleeves. The work is far from finished!
Failed 5-6 Tests:Borderline colonial country. You probably have to start your readings from Chinweizu’sDecolonizing the African Mind, before attempting a decolonization of the nation.
Failed 7-10 Tests:Your country is sadly a glorified colony. We would suggest prayers – but do ensure that your denomination is not in sync with your current colonists. Recommended reading? Franz Fanon’sThe Wretched of the Earth.
Passed all ten tests?Congratulations! Do share the name of your country; and prepare for a spike in immigration.
WHAT CAN WE DO NOW?
To truly decolonize Africa, we must go beyond personnel changes in the statehouses from which Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy and Portugal were evicted, and actually change the colonial systems such that the interests of the African peoples, not their leaders & friends, are in the driving seat of governance.
We must create a system that subjects African leaders to the rule of law. The weakness of the modern African state is that all the powers of the state are vested in the hands of the same law-breakers who are supposed to enforce it. Until the citizens, institutions and associations within each country develop enough muscle to enforce the rule of law, the ruling classes will perpetuate the colonisation of their countries. The solution, therefore, is to create a peer enforcement mechanism that gives the African citizen recourse to an alternative power outside his government to enforce his constitutional rights.
With the growing profile of the African Union, an African-centred Solution is to:
Create pan-African structures (courts, agencies with enforcement powers) that can efficiently offer reliefs to Africans who are stuck with intransigent governments. But merely to create such structures are not enough, because they will immediately be corrupted and will represent just another level of autocracy. To make it work, we must also,
Create effective penalties which will eliminate corruption from the fabric of African Union members by self-regulation rather than the discredited system of litigation and recovery. Such penalties will routinely include Total Assets Forfeiture for people convicted of serious acts of corruption as well as liquidation for corporations convicted of serious corruption. This penalty regime will create the environment that can comprehensively decolonize African countries. Finally we must,
Reward whistle-blowers who provide information on corruption, substantially. This will ensure that all malpractices are eventually reported. The likelihood of eventual ruin is a great incentive to people in power to moderate their abuse of privilege and to keep their behaviour within legal constraints.
CONCLUSION
If you are living in a glorified colony, you are in a hard, but not impossible position. Every generation has to discover its mission, and either betray or realize it. The bogeyman of neocolonialism has long-blinded us to the colonialism being practiced by people of our own skin color. You are called to be Freedom Fighters. A transformation of the African destiny is within your hands, and it is up to you, as the freshly conscious, to act.Now."
Nigerians on Twitter share their inspiring (and realistic) cash-saving experiences,https://punocracy.com/nigerians-on-twitter-share-their-inspiring-and-realistic-cash-saving-experiences/,2020-01-15T09:23:44+01:00,"TWITTER (The T.A. Report)― A group of hard-working and smart Nigerians have taken to Twitter to share their 100 per cent true stories of saving money from little earnings.
Hoping others, especially members of the Youth Wing of the Union of Lazy Nigerians, will learn from their experiences, they also disclosed the mind-blowing things they have invested the savings in, including building houses and hospitals.
The conversation was ignited by a suspicious (but extremely honest) fellow who goes by the nameJack Robinson(@feraljack_) on the social media platform.
“How do you expect someone that earns 20/30k monthly to save with all these bills flying around? Saving is good but you can’t be saving when you’re starving na,” a lazy Nigerian youth,Mazi Olisaemeka, had written.
“I earn 19,800 monthly (for 35 years now) and I’ve managed to build 3 houses in Lagos and one in Kano. Some of you need to learn this saving culture, it’s not every day you eat sharwama, that sharwama money can cover the interior decor of a 3 bedroom flat,” Mr Robinsonthen saidin his reply.
He explained further: “Some of you cancel two bottles of beer every day of the week.  If you starve yourself of beer for just one week, you can use that money to buy a plot of land in Ibeju Lekki and even erect the foundation (depending on the brand of beer you take).”
“See how easy it is?” the wise man queried.
Apparently, Mr Robinson is not alone. Other Nigerians commented with their various testimonies of grass to grace, thanks to their remarkable approach to saving.
Below are some of the tweets:
Since I stopped using AC in my car in 2018, I have saved so much money and I now have THREE 5-Bedroom Duplexes in Asokoro, Ikoyi, and Ikeja GRA.We all need to imbibe this saving culture.
Since i stopped eating out and started limiting myself to using only 1GB data per year, I have successfully completed my shopping complex in Dubai and Seychelles and still have up to 25 million Naira left
I swear,I can confirm this works.Last year, I decided that instead of eating thrice everyday,I'll eat once in 2 days. I cut down my feeding expenses. Today,I've used that money to build 3 fully equipped teaching hospitals where I'm on admission. How did I do it? I believed
I was flat broke in 2017. I couldn't even eat 2ce a day.I took charge of my life, cutting my feeding to once a day, investing the other plate.Today I have two massive eateries in Maitama and Asokoro.Some of you need to sell that PS4 and buy SEGA.
My friend worked in a school where was paid #6500, he saved 6k every month managing #500 for a month. Now he owns an Island in Bahamas, a private volcano in Peru and 3 blue whales in the Atlantic ocean.
I earn 1k less, yet, I own 2 schools on the Island here in Lagos and 3 hotels in Owerri.It's not the salary that's your problem, na ""na one game cut am"" de disturb you.
After two years of Earning 20k and Saving 5k monthly, I now park my private jet in Muritala Abacha Airport
Hahahahaha mad ooo
But of course, there will always be the never-do-wellDoubting Thomii:
Oga… 8.3 million cannot build you one GOOD house in Lagos talk of 2, then Kano.That is your are living on someone else's income and saving all your salary which is bagladash.Find another story. Teinz
#19,800 or $19,800You may be very prudent but tell your full story.
This guy borrowed me his Bentley last week. No be everybody you go see for here dey shout scam ????"
Femi Kuti and Timi Dakolo: Facing mutant truths under muted lights | Oluseyi Olufemi,https://punocracy.com/femi-kuti-and-timi-dakolo-facing-mutant-truths-under-muted-lightsoluseyi-olufemi/,2020-01-15T08:36:59+01:00,"This piece was originally published in two parts,hereandhere, by Premium Times on January 3 and 6, 2020.
Femi Anikulapo Kuti’s award-winning 1998 albumShoki Shokiremains one of the most interesting collection of songs in his Afro-Jazz genre. While this album earned the fair-complexioned heir of Fela a notable continental award for that year, here in Nigeria, one of its track, ‘beng beng beng’ was banned. Many grew curious. Why was this song unfit for our afro musical ears?
We all fully obeyed the censorial advice by not listening to the song on the Nigerian Television Authority and other public channels, but we equally exercised our intellectual rights as responsible patriots to engage the album’s rich artistic delivery and eclectic thematic range in our private studios. Now in 2019, with full knowledge of how the organised Christian conscience cancelled Timi Dakolo’s open truth, it’s so easy to understand why the phony prudes banned Femi’s song.
Femi sang about naked truth. He sang about a lady who he shared his bed with. He gave the lady a voice. He gave the lady a choice. Femi praised her alluring feminine physique, he expressed how he dutifully obeyed her intense orders. Femi sang about masculine desire and restraint; about a woman’s right to dictate who should love her and precisely how she should be loved. Femi was passive and his partner, like Shulamite, was active. That was Femi’s crime!
In that beautiful song that Femi clearly crafted for adult exchanges, he accorded that dignity to every woman which macho-centric cultures always lay waiting to rob her of. This same dignity of the fairer gender was it that Timi Dakolo defended vicariously, vigorously and victoriously on behalf of every girl child. Yet it is this feminine dignity that some crusaders for Jesus Christ in Nigeria are armed to degrade and destroy with all weapons of antisocial warfare.
Pastor Matthew, the tithe collector from England, came out to recklessly decree that this God-given honour in every girl child and grown woman should be defiled with ecclesiastical impunity by the pastor of KOSA in Abuja, because he was “called, committed, consecrated and covenanted by God” to rape and ruin the lives of Nigerian women.
Pastor Matthew preached from the Bible, the holiest book of Christians and admonished the sensible brothers of Jesus Christ gathered at KOSA from the book of Romans 8 verse 33, that anyone who is sexually abused by the KOSA pastor had no right to accuse him of the crime because he is the elect younger brother of God and eternal head of KOSA, Amen! Accuse him of his unconfessed sin and be damned in Hell! Amen! That is why they barred Femi’s song.
Femi sang of the tragic death of Truth. He cried: “Truth don die O!” He mourned with those who had reposed all their honour and hopes in this world in the Truth. In this first track of the same album, he cried relentlessly: “Truth don die O!”, meaning that Truth has died! Yet, when Femi’s sorrow fully melted into the music, it was not only because Truth had been killed. It was because Lie has now replaced Truth and reigns incumbent in the once hallowed courts of Truth. He sings on now, but his sighs get deeper, his breath comes harder and his words come faster:
Truth don die o…Nah yesterday him talkHim want to travel for the worldTo teach him people him wordThe true word of GodMake people stop to lie…
Na so the Molue jam amTrailer mash am for head…Nah so truth come die O
Him come clear road for lieNah lie lie full the worldLie go dey jump from mouthLike water rush from pumpThe way people dey lieDem no dey fear dem GodThe way people dey lieDem no dey fear dem ShrineDem just dey lie O…
Many Christian theologians and teachers may argue that Femi doesn’t know Jesus Christ as much as they do. But in this song, it’s hard to dispute Femi Anikulapo Kuti’s moment of epiphany. For every time Truth is tied and disgraced in the streets, Peter, His foremost apostle, begins to lie. When Truth is tried before human courts, Barabbas the criminal is spared and the innocent thrust with a judicial spear in the side. And when Truth finally dies and is hid from our eyes, the foremost priests in Jerusalem and Nigeria rejoice and reinforce the lie that Truth is gone forever.
Timi Dakolo has proven to be the genuine disciple of Christ through his fearless and faithful witnessing to the resurrected Truth. The Kingsway Storekeeper and his league of disturbed gospel traders know that the resurrected truths of their illicit sexual deals will throw them out of business. That is why they threaten anyone who dares to proclaim that the truth they tortured and killed is risen in greater glory. That is why they pay irresponsible graveside sentries and accursed public relations personnel to publish lies in newspapers and on social media.
Yet truth always rises from the grave of forced silence. Truth will rise in spite of the stone of seared consciences rolled against it in any place. Truth will rise again in spite of the sentries planted by the Christian religious establishment in Nigeria to keep it interred. Let Femi Kuti rejoice, truth will rise again as He had said. Let Timi Dakolo hold fast, truth will overcome before the end. Let Mother Mary rejoice, truth will rise in spite of the monies that have exchanged the hands of Jesus’ disciples to betray it. Let every heart that sighs rejoice, for Truth has risen. It has risen in spite of the honorariums being paid to a perverted Pulpit to deny it. Truth has risen in spite of a polluted Pew that has been swayed to reject it.
Femi Anikulapo Kuti hints, in his easily missed musical parable, that it takes two forces to successfully extinguish truth any day – amolueand a trailer. The molue is a commuter bus notorious for the overload of persons and goods. It was formerly the commonest means of public transport in Lagos, Nigeria. The trailer is the word in the Nigerian parlance for an articulated vehicle, especially a heavy-duty truck. While both were responsible for the fatal end of truth in Femi’s song “Truth don die O”, it appears themolueonly succeeded in jamming and holding truth down for the trailer’s heavy tires to run over the head of truth.
Femi’s prophetic metaphor is a poetic psalm that plays out “in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth”. Here as well, like themolue,Santa Satan cannot single-handedly break the good conscience of a young Christian, he always needs a heavy-duty truck driver like Pastor Matthew Ashewo of Kingsway Logistics to smash a Christian’s skull of truth, which is that young believer’s active conscience.
Indeed, the father of lies can perpetrate lies and persecute those who worship God in Spirit and in truth, but he will always need a rogue agent of truth to finally help deactivate their moral sanity. That is where Al Shaiton finds Pastor Matthew and his establishment friends handy. Their mutant strains of truth are the fastest poison that will ultimately take down a naïve believer.
But sane minds, especially those outside the church’s stranglehold, stand in shock when they see Pastor Matthew Ashewo, the Captain of Kingsway Air Force stand behind KOSA’s pulpit to declare that women who are serially raped and repressed and the few who dare to report their private suffering in the hands of KOSA’s senior sexual predator and pastor are “Satanic accusers and Satanic condemnators”, while the sensible congregation at KOSA cheers him on.
For Timi Dakolo, a professed Christian, his headache is complicated by the fact that it’s the same book of Christian law that the likes of Pastor Matthew Ashewo of Kingsway Stores is twisting to condemn a female victim haunted by years of muted sexual horrors suffered in the hands of the younger brother of God and eternal founder of KOSA, Abuja. Timi’s heartbreak is compounded by the fact that it’s the same Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth that this funky punky-haired vicar of Christ from Ode Omu invokes to curse a wounded lamb, a struggling wife and mother on her road to full emotional recovery.
But Timi faces these traitor trailers alone. He faces these monsters in ministers’ cassocks alone. He battles their mutant truths alone. But why? The church’s inner light does not reveal anymore! Recent history has shown that until light comes from without the church’s orders, the church’s eyes no longer see the rot within, or they’ve simply chosen to be blind. For parishioners who don’t have a blind eye, the presbytery hastily gorges their brighter eye or takes out both eyes to simply prevent them from over-seeing the overseers.
In 2019, it took Kiki Mordi to beam her Christlike light on one of the sexual predators on the pulpit of a major Pentecostal church in Nigeria. Her righteous act makes one ask in retrospect of 2018, why it was only theChicago Tribunethat could exegete the resurrected truth of decades of sexual molestation of women by the leadership of a 24-thousand congregation south of Barrington, Illinois, U.S.A?
Again, why was it secular truth that was strong enough to force the exit of that unrepentant clergyman from the pulpit, a few months to his glorious retirement? The answer, as it is in KOSA in Abuja, Nigeria, is that the elders of that church had heard the truth from the abused and hurting women, but they refuse to hearken to their cries of distress. They show no pity for the wounded and bleeding sheep. They rise instead to protect their deadly and holy hyena.
These women who dare to speak out and reveal the truth used to be protected and respected as real lights. But that was long before Justices of Piss like Pastor Matthew Ashewo took over the sacred work of interpreting the Christian Constitution. These post-truth preachers have since amended the Bible and repealed this portion below (in Ephesians 5:3-13 NKJV) that clearly states that men as Timi Dakolo are the endangered but true lights of the world:
3. But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness,let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints;4. neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.6. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.7. Therefore do not be partakers with them.8. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light9. (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness,and truth),10. finding out what is acceptable to the Lord.11. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,but rather expose them.12. For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.13. But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light,for whatever makes manifest is light.
Clearly today, the church’s light no longer reveals the shameful acts within. The church’s lights no longer dislodge darkness. Instead, it venerates it. That is why Pastor Matthew Ashewo is bold to publicly torment the psyches of the daughters of light who dare to expose the shameful things done in secret in KOSA. That is why this only avatar of Kingsway and acclaimed fourth person of the Holy Trinity unleashes his mutant strains of truth to crowd out the remnant voices of reason.
For Femi Anikulapo Kuti, the greatest tragedy in our moral universe is when Truth is killed and Lie takes its place. But Timi Dakolo has found out, two decades after, that the killing of Truth is not the worst event. The younger singer faces a greater grief than the death of truth – the dearth of Mary Magdalene and the other women, the cowardice of the men, the threats of darkness and the silence of the lights.

The 1001 gates of Nigerian democracy,https://punocracy.com/the-1001-gates-of-nigerian-democracy/,2020-01-13T11:01:47+01:00,"Gates. The origin of the word ‘Gate’ as used in this article can be traced back to the Watergate Scandal that rocked the Nixon administration in the early 70s and is used to denote the existence of a far-reaching political scandal, unethical behaviour or a cover-up in or around the corridors of power.
In
Nigeria my country of origin, our leaders are natural disasters. Every day,
they descend to new levels of absurdity in their fuckery of our collective will
such that it takes a lot to actually shock us.
Thus, when scandals occur, we pay little or no attention to them. Gates, on the other hand, are a different matter entirely given their ability to rouse our spirits and transcend the ethnoreligious divides within the country. In other words, If it is not a Gate, then it is not worthy of our time and attention as Nigerians as we cannot be bothered to waste our outrage on a non-issue
Prior to my lifetime, Gates such as DikkoGate where the Nigerian government bungled an attempt to kidnap a former Minister of Finance from the abroad to face prosecution in the Country are stuff of legend, and of the many Gates that have occurred in my lifetime, the following for me are standouts.
LAWANGATE
Farouk Lawan; also known as Mr. Integrity on the floor of the House, was tasked with the Chairmanship of the subsidy committee by the Jonathan administration to investigate how subsidy funds were disbursed. What followed next was like a Hollywood thriller.One of Nigeria’s richest men, Femi Otedola, Chairman of Zenon Oil, one of the companies under investigation alleged that Mr. Integrity demanded bribe in the sum of  $620,000perefrom him. A sting operation was arranged by security forces, Mr. Integrity was caught on tape and audio receiving the bribe money thus putting an end to his storied career in the house.As for the alleged bribe money, we don’t know where it is as Mr. Integrity is still on trial 8 years after the incident and no headway has been made in the trial against him.
DIEZANIGATE
Nigeria’s Minister for Petroleum under Oga Jona, Madam Diezani is alleged to have drunk Nigeria’s treasury like “oyel” to a yet to be determined tune of Naira alongside Messrs Kola Aluko and Jide Omokere.When the time to pay for her alleged sins drew near,Mama, unfortunately (or fortunately) developed cancer in the abroad and is currently away on treatmentand more importantly, away from the short arm of Nigerian Law.
MAINAGATE
This one big gan and e heavy for mouth. Imagine make person tiff money, come collect double promotion on top am again? Na gele wetin happen for hia be dat.
Pensions boss Abdulrasheed Maina, in cahoots with his friends and family,   in what was reported to be a well-coordinated scam, was alleged to have looted 17 billion out of the 24 billion Naira set aside to pay the pensions of patriotic, retired but not tired Nigerians. He was subsequently dismissed and prosecuted by the FG. But in a twist of events, a Court ordered his reinstatement and even gave him double promotion gan thereby rubberstamping his alleged misdeeds as worthy of emulation.
IKOYIGATE
The DSS through the assistance of a “whistle-blower” discovered the sums of   $43, 449, 947, £27,800 and N23,  218 in an apartment in Ikoyi alleged to belong to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA).Although some people alleged that Parosident Muhamadu Buhari okayed the whole thing, no one as a matter of course, stepped forward to claim the money and same was forfeited to the Federal Government coffers upon the order of court.
ETTEHGATE
Na ordinary 628 million Naira renovation Mama approve o when Mr. Integrity, No. 1 on this list blew the whistle and cried foullllll. She was impeached as Speaker on the matter,was eventually cleared by the House committee set up to look into it, but the damage had already been done, her name smeared and forever to be associated with the infamous Ettehgate.
BANKOLEGATE
Nigeria’s youngest Speaker of the House of representatives, Banky as we’ll call him was alleged to have extrajudicially enriched himself from the coffers of the Federal Republic. What followed was a classic Nigerian tale of “Ole Ji, Ole Gba” to which there was no ending.
ODUAHGATE
Madam Oduah of the Bulletproof car fame. Mama is alleged to have spent N225 Million of Nigerian taxpayers’ money on Two BMW bulletproof cars simply because she could.The whereabouts of the said cars are indeterminate at the time of writing
ADEOSUNGATE
Madam Kemi Kemo!!! Madam Kemi fell victim of Oluwole boys who helped her “runs” her NYSC exemption certificate.After an in-depth investigation by Premium Times(this is what they call investigative journalism in case you people are not aware), Madam was deemed not to possess the requisite certificate, resigned her position as Nigeria’s Minister for Finance, quietly left the country in the middle of the night for the UK in a bid to escape the long or in this case, the short arm of Nigerian law and put her tarnished reputation back together. Sigh. The things you get for serving your fatherland, right?
SHITTUGATE
Nigeria’s shameless Minister for Communication.After investigations by Premium Times revealed that he did not serve his fatherland,instead of thealainironuto hang his head in shame, the,dognidorocame out on-air and said yes, he intentionally did not serve Nigeria as he had in his own words “fulfilled a higher calling by winning election into the Oyo state house of assembly” and so, he did not need to go for Service.Theodeknew we had short memories in Nigeria and unlike Madam Kemi Kemo who took the high road, Adebayo has decided to die there and he remains a Minister of the federation till date.
GANDUJEGATE
Gandudollars!!!! As at the time of writing,5 videos of His Excellency; the Governor of Kano State; Alhaji Umar Ganduje receiving kickbacks from contractors for the award of contracts in Kano State have surfaced online.It is as if Jafar Jafar, the publisher of the Daily Nigerian Newspaper and the brain behind the reveal knows that we have short memories in Nigeria. As soon as we are about to forget, the man releases another video to reinforce in our mind that we have a crook in government.In a twist of events, some citizens of Kano State could be seen carrying placards in defence and support of their hero…and as Elnathan said “The people of Kano State do not deserve satire” if they cannot see what is in front of their collective noses.

How many dollars per barrel is Qasem Soleimani worth?,https://punocracy.com/dollars-per-barrel-qasem-soleimani/,2020-01-09T09:03:02+01:00,"By: Chuks .Chinyere(jj)
What’s funny is how the death of one man can mean so much and how nobody is talking about the other guy: the Iraqi militia leader who was killed alongside “you know who”. If I get a dollar for each time I’ve heard the name, Qasem Soleimani, in the last few days, I’ll have enough money to establish myself very well in the crude oil business, which has become extra lucrative in recent times, thanks to the death of one man.
Say what you want about how wrong Trump was for ordering Qasem’s assassination, you can say some more about how he overstepped his boundaries and was selfish in his decision, I’ll not argue with you based on the singular fact that you are entitled to your opinion — no matter how shortsighted it might be.
However brethren, I dare say, Trump’s decision to kill Qasem Soleimani because they “have intelligence report that General Qasem was planning a bad bad bad thing” is a dumb and stupid excuse to justify such a selfless decision. Mans like Qasem is always planning something bad. General Soleimani’s womb escape was “something bad” enough that deserves some sort of assassination, yet past Presidents have kept him alive. Trump will not have it. Trump trumps different.
I see how the White House, from the Secretary of States to the Defense Secretary, is trying so hard, interview after interview, to justify the assault on Iraq’s sovereignty and the assassination of Soleimani. It’s pitiful how much of a terrible job they are doing. For the first time since Trump became POTUS, this is the most selfless decision he has made, causing such a surge in oil prices, leaving every member of OPEC pleased and richer than the night before. This is an angle the White House should explore in defending the president’s action.
It’s true that everything Trump had done since the day he assumed office, every single decision, had him in the forefront asbeneficiary number one. But this assassination, eh, is one philanthropic move, if not for anything, at least for how it has affected Buhari’s travel budget and the world market. Trump is such a benevolent man, doing everyone favours they didn’t ask for; we should all begreat-fool.
For the first time since September, oil prices hit a new high of $70 per barrel, a massive 4 per cent leap; something that had Buhari and the cabal smiling to the bank like a Yahoo boy who has just cashed out. It’s true that, as I type this, the price has fallen back a bit to $68 per barrel, but this is still pretty high compared to when Qasem Soleimani was roaming earth’s surface freely.
These high prices are falling-falling because Iran has failed us, Iran has failed to match action with all that plenty talk. Dear Iran, we need you tobursta move, an actual move. We need you to back up all that talk with some action, some real action, not targeting a US base with missiles no better than three sound knockouts.
This is 2020, a year of no more “1000 yarns zero action”, do something for the love of high prices goddammit! You have done it before, like when you bombarded that Saudi Arabia Oil processing plant, remember? It helped increase oil prices and our cabal cashed out. I know it’s selfish and insensitive of me, but do it for boys.
Don’t just do something that will affect oil prices alone o, think outside the box. we need Bitcoin prices to go up too, we don’t care how many lives it might cost, American, Iraqi or Iranian, all we want is thatshmoney. Trump has done his bit, such a genius of a man he even affected Gold prices with one singular action and he has promised to do more even; does “52” ring a bell?
See eh Iran, leave all thatopata yarns; we need more than placing an $80 million bounty on the head of the most protected man in the modern world, you got to do more bro, unless you’re making all these noise just to cash out heavy new negotiations on an improved nuclear deal.
Dear investor, for the last four years I have been chasing you all over Lagos with PowerPoint slides of one “lucrative” business idea after another, all to no avail. Now, however, is your time. You have to believe me when I say moving all your money into the oil business will be the best thing you can do with all that ill-gotten wealth.
Uncle Dangote has moved with foresight, you got to follow (his) suit. Experts predict that oil prices are looking to go as high as $160 per barrel should this Iran-US conflict escalate into a full-blown war in the Middle East. Isn’t that just terrific news? Don’t worry about the kids that will die, that’s on the US for refusing to evacuate Iraq’s property.
Did I hear you say Congress will not allow Trump go to war?Leemao!Congress that is still finding it hard to catch up with the modern use of Twitter for important presidential media reports and briefings? While they’ll be busy awaiting official communications from the White House on the President’s decision to go to war with Iran and its allies, @realDonaldTrump will be dishing out battle formations on Twitter.Aunty Nancy really needs to get updated, she’s dealing with a 21st century virtual POTUS; someone should tell her this.

We live in a world (or country?) where journalists have, without intending it, become greater comedians than professional humorists. Don’t believe us? Keep reading.
The Kano State Government has banned persons of opposite genders from plying same commercial tricycles across the state from January, 2020, an official has announced. Governor Abdullahi Ganduje revealed this on Wednesday at the closing ceremony of 77th annual Islamic Vacation Course (IVC) organised by Zone A of Muslim Society of Nigeria (MSSN) held at Bayero University, Kano. Mr Ganduje, who was represented by Commander General of Hisbah Board, Harun Ibn-Sina, said the state government is committed towards upholding Islamic values.
A Nigerian Senator, Elisha Abbo, who was caught months ago assaulting a woman in a sex toy shop, has been honoured with a ‘Beacon of Hope’ award at the 4th edition of the Adamawa Celebrities and Achievers Awards (ACAA). Mr Abbo, representing Adamawa North at the red chamber, is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court in Abuja abruptly suspended sitting and fled her court on Friday as operatives of the Department of State Service invaded the courtroom to rearrest Sahara Reporters publisher, Omoyele Sowore, less than 24 hours of releasing him from earlier illegal custody.
Ja’afaru Ahmed, controller general of Nigeria Correctional Service, says the cell in which some inmates got electrocuted at the Ikoyi Custodial Centre, has a capacity of 35 but inhabited 140 persons. Some inmates at the Centre were electrocuted on Monday morning while 10 others sustained injuries in the incident. In a statement, Francis Enobore, spokesman of the service, quoted Ahmed as describing the incident as “tragic and most ill-fated”.
The Jigawa State Government has opened tender for the construction of 90 Friday congregational and five daily prayer mosques, across the 30 constituencies of the state. Isma’il Ibrahim, the spokesperson, office of the Secretary to the State Government, made this known in a statement in Dutse on Tuesday.
The governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ben Ayade, has warned his newly appointed commissioners and other political appointees to desist from making public and policy statements on social media… In the statement, Governor Ayade also warned the commissioners and appointees of the government against granting or making both radio and television interviews or appearances without getting authorisation from him. “Henceforth no commissioner or political appointee is allowed to showcase or make policy pronouncements on social media without seeking clearance from His Excellency. Every commissioner is from now henceforth expected to prove himself or herself on the field rather than on the social media,” the statement read.
The founder of the Resurrection Praise Ministries Worldwide has called on religious and traditional rulers, including well-meaningNigeriansto resist any attempt to plunge the nation into the practice of witchcraft. The cleric stated that the nation is yet to recover from the effects of FESTAC which was held in the country in 1977, and that any such gathering will spell mayhem for the country. He spoke on Saturday during a phone-in programme on Metro fm in reaction to a planned ‘first international & interdenominational conference on Witchcraft’, slated to hold at the University of Nsukka, Enugu State, and called on Nigerians to reject it. The cleric lamented that there is danger in allowing the conference hold in the country, as that it is a guise to hold a public and mass initiation of people, especially students into witchcraft practice.
The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday, said Nigerians should not continue going abroad for medical treatment. “Nigerians have suffered so much going abroad for medical treatment. This is not good for us and it must stop because we can’t afford it again,” he said. The President, who himself had travelled to the United Kingdom for treatment on several occasions, stated this at the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, during the inauguration and handover of completed projects to the management of the hospital.
The French president, EmmanuelMacron, hasasked West African leaders to travel to Paris for immediate talks in the wake of the killing of 13 French soldiers in Mali last week. Macron, who is currently at the NATO summit in England, issued a condemnation of the regional leaders, who he said sometimes hold anti-French sentiments. “I can’t, nor do I want French soldiers on the ground while there is anti-French sentiment that is sometimes held by the leader,” Bloomberg quotes the Frenchpresidentas saying. He therefore wants “clarifications” from the leaders of Niger, Mali, Chad, Mauritania and Burkina Faso when they are in Paris on December 16."
The Marlian Empire: A brief history on human history,https://punocracy.com/the-marlian-empire/,2020-01-05T10:36:39+01:00,"T​​he year is 001 Marlian Era (ME) and the world has been rearranged into three regions: Natural Marlians (NMs), Marlians Ensuite (ME), and Barbarian Marlians (BMs). The NMs used to be Africans and Europeans. The ME covered the regions formerly known as Asia, and Oceania. The BMs are the rest of the world.
The Marlian Conquest started as a slow, peaceful, and delightful movement from Lagos, Marlian Republic of Nigeria, which is now the capital of the Marlian Empire. The first Marlian was a lanky man, with legs intertwined like ropes, named Hafiz Fashola. His fame grew after he was arrested for allegedly defrauding and impersonating Caucasians.
He innovated dances likesoapyandtesumole, while also aligning himself with the popular Zanku movement by an artist that burned fast like Candle. His name is not recorded in history books. Though we read that Zanku was a movement at some point in our history, it was nothing close to the Marlian Dance.
NM swept through Nigeria and the rest of the world during the unrest of the WW3 between the Marlian States of America and the Arabic Marlian Emirate of Iran. This was in 2020AD. NM offered a panacea to world peace by asking angry Leaders to dance Tesumole at 1:00 am every day for a week, and they’ll soon realise that the world would be better if we made love and not war.
The changes were fast and vast. American soldiers were seen attempting Tesumole in Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The videos went viral and the soldiers faced court marital. The world went wild in amusement when the Military Court broke into a Tesumole dance as Judges shouted,“Ọmọ ìyá mi, mo wa pẹ̀lú ẹ, má fo”.
POTUS Trump’s video dancing to Tesumole soon leaked, and he first denied that his hair is blonde as opposed to the orange-haired dancer in the video. He eventually came out of the closet and was embraced by top military chiefs.
The wars ended and Hafiz started a conquest. It would become the only bloodless conquest in the history of the human race. Within thirty years, Hafiz became the Supreme Charismatic Leader (an office created specially for him) controlling the United Nations. On Marlianry 5 2050, he changed the UN to No Battle Ground (NBG) and proceeded to create global peace through disarmament.
Three Marlian years later, a revolution started.
This revolution started the Global Marlian Dance (GMD) contest, which ended up separating the world into three regions. His Excellency, Supreme Charismatic Leader, Hafiz ascended to the heavens on Marlianber 10, 2055. The world was thrown into chaos. There was a scramble for who the next leader would be. Joe Abah, Ogbeni Dipo, Segalink, and Elnathan John, the Four Sage Marlians came together in Lagos, and appointed a new Marlian Leader; Zinoleesky.
Zinoleesky went to work immediately and restarted time. He started the Marlian Era which we are in today. We don’t know what is left for Zino to achieve that Hafiz hasn’t, but we hope his era will forever unite the three Marlian regions so that we can all do MD without discrimination.
Mafo!
Marlian Princely X, Minister for Love and Light."
The Meme Resistance: How to stand against global oppression,https://punocracy.com/the-meme-resistance/,2020-01-05T08:18:00+01:00,"The year is 3100 and memes have been banned. The Interplanetary Alliance (replaced the United Alliance, which replaced the UN) now sits in Lagos, Nigeria. The IA is an alliance of Humans (CEOs of the top one percent tech companies), Robots, and life forms from other planets.
The IA has focused over the years on elevating all life forms to the deus (God) level, devoid of emotions, sentiments, and the weaknesses that make organisms vulnerable to outbursts, war, and constant laughter. We live in a serious world now, and you’re either a part of it or you’ll be purged.
To be purged means to be uploaded to a server where your worst memories are played in a loop while putting your consciousness in REM state, so that you are present, unable to run away, and feeling all the mental torture at once.
Nobody makes it out of the purge with emotions. When you get out, the IA returns you to society, puts you on permanent surveillance, and ensures that you, or anyone close to you, are permanently rid of human emotions; especially the cackling sound humans make when they open their mouth in amusement and joy. They said in the 2000s they called it laughter.
Laughter, they said, was the most human thing for a long time. It was how people managed through depression. It was how people related in social circles. It was how people formed alliances, and ended up in private unions. It was shit. The world is more advanced now. Everything is based on logic. The basic human behaviour today is to bewoke. There is no place for laughter here. We are made to live, and to do. Not to languish in the weaknesses that come with basic emotions like happiness.
But as all human history has recorded, there will always be deviants. Creatures who think they know better than society and try to fight it. In our case, we have the Meme Resistance. The meme is a stupid gesture in still or playback images that triggers laughter. What a mess!
The Meme Resistance is led by Eric Trump Jnr, great grandchild to Donald J. Trump, who was the epitome of the meme era. Orange, Chauvfefe, WWIII are some of the memes adduced to his era. It was in fact because of his reflex need to always make controversial social talks on an archaic social media platform called@Twitterthat he levelled America’s position as the world’s most powerful country to a battleground for African political re-election campaigns. But this isn’t about Donald. This is about the Meme Resistance.
In Nigeria, the resistance is headed by the great-grandchild to a Nobel laureate in comical satire@Oli_Ekun; also taking his ancestor’s “Àgbà” title. Àgbà is the most feared Meme resistance leader. Just five years ago, he hacked into government servers and mass released a comical voiceover that made robots laugh, and visiting life forms giggle. It was unheard of.
This made the IA offer a seat at the council table for anyone who’s to help in the capture of Àgbà. It was an ally, the great-grandson to a former Twitter famous human,@Dehkunlewho gave Àgbà out.
The IA has been silent on giving out the seat, as the woke people of the Universe have questioned the source of the betrayal. If he knew so much, then he must have been a part of it. This is definitely a ploy to get a member of the meme resistance into council, in order to take over.
While the IA has been silent on Dehkunle’s descendant, today we stand gathered to witness the purging of Àgbà. VR cams on our eyes, we all watched the live upload. All was smooth and fine, and Àgbà was uploaded successfully. But as the upload entered the 90th percentile. The system glitched, and Àgbà sent one last broadcast.
“Ko ni bàjẹ́ baby”, he said, before finally purging. The world smiled."

The person who convinced women that their freedom is in nakedness and body positivity lies in indecent exposure scored a screamer for patriarchy.
Legend.
Want to stick it to the patriarchy and protest against the objectification of women? Sure! Show some ass. Power to the people.
Objectify yourself before they objectify you.
They can’t objectify you if you objectify yourself first. The more you can show, the more powerful you have.
Men are scum. They are dogs, they do not respect women. The only way to take power back from them is by showing some labia. That’ll teach the idiots a lesson.
Wait what?! Men have all the sex and shame you for the same act. That’s stupid. Make them pay by fucking them for pleasure. Fuck him, leave, then never call him again. That’s powerful, that’s progressive. Makes you a strong independent woman.
Forget the Queen of England, she’s old. Forget every woman at the royal weddings not showing some boobs. They are part of a patriarchal institution. Showing ass is the new royalty. Wear nothing, post, and caption it: “Queen”. That’s what really makes you a Queen.
Queen Elizabeth who?

You can say all you want about Donald Trump but you can’t say the man does not know how to host blockbuster talk shows — talk about the Real King of Reality TV. It’s true the guy is not so “presidential” like Barack but, come on, dude is more fun to watch and hear speak than Kenny Blaq and Benni Mac put together.
His actions are just vibe after vibe, and the spotlight is his to use as he pleases. No matter how many times the Obamas release song charts in a year, or how many books Hillary Clinton (co-)writes, Trevor Noah and Jimmy Kimmel will never stop talking aboutmanslike Trump, thepop-liticianof the decade. Pop-stars got nothing on him.
It’s the funniest thing ever when anyone says, Donald Trump is the dumbest US President in recent times. I can’t begin to imagine why anyone would think of something so untrue. One minute Nancy Pelosi and her squad at the Congress are trying to kick Mr Trump out of the White House, the next minute the United States is conducting airstrikes in Iraqi airspace killing Iran’s top military leader, Qasem Soleimani.
Now let’s see how old people in fine expensive suits will have time to discuss removing the President with Iran and North Korea hailing all kinds of fireworks on them; genius move Trump!
The latest statement from Pelosi was regarding the airstrike that killed Soleimani; there wasn’t one word about the impeachment. She — as expected — condemned President Trump’s decision in ordering such a significant attack without consulting Congress first. I like Madam Nancy a lot, she’s a strong woman with a strong character, and I dare say she’s very pretty too; I wish I were in her age group. The only problem is she seems to be very slow in catching up on updates.
“As POTUS, I can do what I like.”
Did Madam Nancy think Trump was kidding? It’s a hard nut to crack, but it’s high time she and all other Democrats said bye-bye to the “people-centred” and “absolute respect for the Rule of Law” kind of due-process Democracy they were so used to. Trump is here to trump everything.
It’s a shame that the world’s big brother and mascot for democracy, the upholders of fairness and equity, the free world, is now being run onTyranny Lite. It’s heartbreaking but the people of the United States should take heart, it happens to the best of us. If a country like Nigeria, with all that Crude Oil, still imports PMS, what is the small dictatorship that the United States cannot manage?
Iran has warned that they will retaliate; exactly what Trump wants. Nobody wants to remove a President while there is a raving mad nuclear weapon-wielding megalomaniac on the loose. Kim Jong Un promised the US a holiday present too, another reason to put up with Trump for a few more years,mansdid really set up a plot twist in this show and everyone is falling for it.
I’m bored, I’m really looking forward to some international muscle-flexing, all that money spent on building nuclear weapons must not go to waste. I need Iran to lit up the sky, I need sparks to fly, enough of tweeting Mr Trump, press the damn button you have under your table at the Oval Office! Let’s see what you got; I bet you got nothing on our amiable men of the Nigerian Army.
The only problem is, a war between Iran and the US will happen in Iraq, killing more Iraqis than any other national, and that is just funny to say the least… how this world politics thing works."
"Delayed childbirth: Nigeria’s celebrity baby, Vision 2020, ‘not fully formed yet’",https://punocracy.com/vision-2020-not-fully-formed-yet/,2020-01-02T08:40:00+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― The arrival of Nigeria’s long-expected child, Vision 2020, may in fact not take place this year, according to experts. This they say is because, despite fervent prayers and predictions, the foetus has not fully formed yet and is not ready for delivery.
Commenting on the problem during an interview with the T.A. Report on Wednesday, senior political gynaecologist Dr Shina Williams-Marley said the development did not come as a surprise to him.
“As you know, Vision 2020 was conceived nearly 11 years ago and this is more than enough time for a normal, medium-sized baby to become mature,” he said as he adjusted his perfectly round eyeglasses.
“But Nigeria is a terrible mother. Our studies show that she has not been feeding herself a balanced diet and taking necessary supplements. She is also an unrepentant alcoholic and drug addict, and all these have caused the unborn child to shrink rather than gain needed weight.
“Some of my colleagues even say she might have forgotten she has a baby kicking in her womb.”
Another reason for the lack of care shown to Vision 2020, Williams-Marley explained, that is that the child belongs to Umaru Musa Yar’adua, Nigeria’s former husband who is now late. Goodluck Jonathan, Yar’adua’s successor, and Muhammadu Buhari, her current husband, have all but disowned the poor kid.
This is not the first time Nigeria has suffered such a fate. Ten years ago, back when she was still pregnant with Vision 2010, she infamously had a terrible miscarriage.
The family’s spokesperson, Garuba Chewer, has said they are considering renaming Nigeria’s child to Vision 2030 or “we may have to start all over again”.
“Think about it,” he said excitedly as someone who has just discovered the Theory of Everything. “We chose 20: 2020 not only because we wanted our child to be one of the 20 biggest in the world but because the numbers also rhyme. All we have to do now is settle for 10: 2030 which, you have to agree, is another beautiful combination.”

Distinguished President of the Kalakuta Republic has led the tradition of declaring resolutions for this year.
The resolutions were announced at a press conference held on New Year’s Day where the President welcomed the citizens of the republic to the new year.
Speaking at the event, the President prayed that there will be no revolutionary protests and Twitter wars in the new year.
He also urged the people to be well-behaved since “there will be no need for arrests if everyone is silent when things go wrong”.
He added that “we need to be in our best behaviour in this new year so that our foreign brothers and sisters from the US of A will not continue to send us letters of caution”.
Concluding his New Year’s address, the President declared his new year resolutions.
He said, “In the spirit of sober reflection that accompanies the new year, I have also compiled my lists of new year resolutions. These will guide me throughout the new year and will be my driving principles.”
“I will not be saying all of my resolutions because some are personal but the top two are: I have finally resolved to stand down in 2023 and I will obey court orders when I deem fit,” he said.
“Oh! I will also be returning my wife to Daura instead of the other room. Enough of alleging that some cabal is controlling me. This one is not a resolution but an exigency,” he concluded."

Report)― The achievements of woman-beating senator, Elisha Abbo, have finally been recognised as a source of inspiration to others like him or those who wish to adopt his uniquehumanwoman relations model.
On Saturday, December 21, during the 4th Adamawa Celebrities and Achievers Awards (ACAA) ceremony held in Yola, the distinguished senator washonoured witha “Beacon of Hope” award.
This was six months after Abbo was caught on tape using a young nursing woman, identified as Warmate Osimibibra, as a slapping bag and showing her who was boss at an Abuja adult toy store. He had in Julyalso receivedamuch-deserved“Icon at Democracy” award from the Intercommunity Awareness for Change and Development Initiative (IACDI).
“It is a success story like no other,” one of the award committee members told our correspondent. “We are aware our decision is quite controversial and some people do not agree, but let’s not forget that one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.”
“Likewise, one man’s woman-beater is another man’s moneybag… ahem… sorry, I mean role model,” he added, with a flush of embarrassment.
The ACAA committee has described the lawmaker’s achievements as “simply incredible”.
“They remind us, in these trying days, that it is still a man’s world, that man is still at the top of the pecking order,” the committee head said in a prepared speech he forgot to read at the event.
“Abbo’s achievements give us hope that a man can still walk into any establishment, beat up people who challenge his God-given authority, and walk away with both his manhood and status intact. They give us hope that even the efficiency of security cameras and the outrage of all of the social media aren’t enough to bring down a daring man, no less a lawmaker with higher standards of behaviour. We are excited that such trifles as a man slapping a woman aren’t a genuine concern for the courts and legislature in this modern era.”
“This is all the assurance we need that this country is woman-beating-friendly and is notanti-men-who-are-anti-women. Such a relief, I would say,” he added.
Former Vice PresidentAtiku Abubakar was also honoured as Philanthropist of the Decade at the ACAA ceremony, apparently for his many generous donations during the campaign period. The organisers said they would have been delighted to award President Muhammadu Buhari the prestigious Lover of Human Rights Award if only he were from Adamawa.

There are no youth like my country’s youth,https://punocracy.com/there-are-no-youth-like-my-countrys-youth/,2019-12-30T07:48:26+01:00,"By: Olawale Smart
The white pride a lot in their foolishness. They think being smart and wise is when young boys and girls create innovative things that make the world a better place.
Mumupeople. How did they even manage to colonise us? Do I need to ask? The answer is quite obvious: the youth of then were not the studious science students and innocentMarleyianswe have today.
I watched a video clip online. Some American citizens in their bid to throw Donald Trump out of office formed a group of choristersand sang, “Take him out of the office, drag him out if you must…”
If I was a prophet, I would certainly receive God’s inspiration from the way the song was beautifully rendered. Is that how to throw a president out of office? Does that even show that they are angry about whatever state they’re in?
They brought Christianity to Nigeria, yet they still don’t understand that since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of God suffereth violence and the violent take it by force.
I trust Nigerian youth. They understand that there is no way the kingdom of God will suffer violence and earth will be left out of the play. Who has the time to compose “take him out of the office” nonsense… when we have an endless number of songs composed by angry and faceless composers. Where is “We no go gree o, we no go gree!” or “Bubu, ole, Sarak ole!”?
The song is not really what has got me angry though. How can you be chanting a song meant to throw a president out of office and the stadium (your location) is still full of people chilling? Where are the guns? The cutlasses? The smoke? They did not even burn any tyre. Actionless people!
Kudos to the Nigerian youth wherever they are, I trust them. The bulk of the people who’ll die will not be from the family of the people they’re directing their anger towards (something called ‘Ironic Attack’). In fact, some people won’t die by guns or any other stunt of an angry mob, they will die due to stampedes caused by people running helter-skelter. When there is no bad blood, no flame, no weapon, to Nigerian youth, you are still involved in a child’s play.
Let me do the whites (and to whomsoever this may concern) a favour by explaining some of the Nigerian youth-style of anger if you really mean serious business about the nation’s good:
1. Invade the streets and destroy all basic amenities that come in your way: You don’t have to care that the masses are still craving for more facilities and infrastructure. The ones you’ve got by luck, raze them all down with fire. If you don’t do that, how will they know that you mean business?
2. Invade Aso-Rock  — with hashtags, but stay in your room during protests: This is another very important way to be angry as a Nigerian youth. Tweet all the hashtags but don’t step out of your house to voice your pain. If everybody is on the street, who will alert Aso-rock that something is going on?
3. Lastly, the ultimate style of any serious, angry Nigerian youth: Sometimes, you have to collect bribe to fight against your fellow comrades who are fighting a good cause. If you don’t do that, how will you enjoy out of the national cake that people are eating anyhow? It is also necessary so that the news of the struggle to make top headlines on mainstream media.
With these few points of mine, I hope have been able to confuse you and not convince myself that there are no youth like my country’s youth.
Caveat: This writer believes in the abilities of Nigerian youth and, as a youth himself, he knows they are strongly capable of transforming the country but thinks they should go and read on, “Right Ways to get Angry”. Being too serious may sometimes be considered unseriousness.

Secrets behind Major General Buhari’s ruthlessness | Tunde Odesola,https://punocracy.com/secrets-behind-major-general-buharis-ruthlessness-tunde-odesola/,2019-12-30T07:13:43+01:00,"The lamb at home doesn’t know the deadliness of the hunter in the forest. Radical issues require drastic actions. With uncommon courage and a massive sense of patriotism, I, Babatunde Odesola, a middle-aged Nigerian journalist and a die-hard lover of democracy, hereby, call for a revolution against millions of Nigerians who have been demonizing Mallam Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) and his amazing party, the All Progressives Congress.
The acronym, GCFR, is the biggest garland in the land, befitting of a major-general running a vicious regime. GCFR means Grand Commander of the Federal Republic, and not Grand Corrupter of the Federal Republic, which resonates more with the Nigerian masses.
A down-to-earth truth is that if angels descend from heaven and take charge of Aso Rock today, some unscrupulous anti-establishment protesters will still sing ‘aluta’ on rooftops, in market squares and at road junctions, setting alight raging bonfires. Well, I know the ruling APC has graciously provided state-of-the-art facilities for revolution chanters, Omoyele Sowore, Olawale Bakare, Nnamdi Kanu and their religious ilk, Ibrahim el-Zakzaky, to digitally mix their ‘aluta’ songs with seasonal carols in nationwide prison holes now dignified as correctional facilities.
Before I’m accused of collecting money from the major-general to do a hatchet job, let me point out that Alhaji Buhari’s stinginess stinks to high heaven, and I love him for that. Nigeria is in dire need of a tight-fist, no-nonsense ‘old soja’ like Sai Baba. Buhari is an ungenerous, 77-year-old herdsman, who doesn’t throw money at people, except for his indulgence of his rich, motorbiking son, Yusuf, whose siblings coughed out high foreign exchange as school fees to graduate from schools abroad. Yes, the children must have personally paid their foreign school fees by themselves because Pa Buhari can’t afford to pay such crazy fees!
I don’t need no stupid protesters like Sowore, Bakare and their accomplice lawyer, Femi Falana, to tell me that Buhari’s life earnings can’t foot the tuitions of his several children that schooled abroad; I know the truth. I know such money is unaffordable for even a Field Marshal in the Nigerian Army. I also remember that Buhari gave his uncle, Mamman Daura, a palatial residence inside Aso Rock, where the latter and his overindulged daughters noisily live off taxpayers’ money with impunity. Those must be the lazy Nigerian youths Buhari was referring to in London, last year.
I didn’t forget that this incorruptible major-general is for everybody and for nobody. This is why he could proudly identify with his children’s numerous foreign certificates, but not with their tuitions. This is natural; honest major-generals don’t like stains on their starched khakis. They won’t look kindly at you if you blow thekakakiwhen you see their long, lean hands in the hot pot of soup and the palm oil tell-tale on their bony lips. Abeg, don’t ask me where the money could have come from; manna still falls in the Katsina desert, you unbeliever!
Nationwide, people accuse Mr Buhari of nepotism, clannishness, clumsiness, sluggishness, brazenness and lawlessness. Though dazed by these allegations, I’ll still rise to Baba’s defence by saying Buhari has saved so much money for Nigeria. But they chorus, “Taaa! Baba nla falsehood.” These revolutionists are stubborn and silly, you know. They say Nigeria needs not save up money stupidly in a piggy bank which is accessible to bats in bullion vans. They ask, “Of what good is it to save up money in a leaky piggy bank while foreign debts drown the nation? Of what good is it to jingle money in a piggy bank like a three-year-old while unemployment, hunger, insecurity, poverty and hopelessness ravage the land?”
These revolutionists are stupid. They went back in time to 1983, the year of reckless military abandon when Major-General Buhari snatched power, and they came up with disturbing facts. They began to question and query. Foolishly, these silly revolutionists couldn’t understand why Vice-President Alex Ekwueme, a mere ‘spare tyre’, and several governors from the South-West and South-East were clamped behind bars while the head of the alleged corrupt and undisciplined civilian government, President Shehu Shagari, was left out of jail — without trial. Also, they said the major-general and world’s No 1 Anti-Corruption Crusader never condemned the evil regime of the dark-goggled armed-robber general, Sani Abacha, who is still sinfully rich — more than 21 years after his death and alarming seizures of his outrageous loot. But I ask, “Are all these enough to label Mr Integrity an ethnic bigot? In what ways do these little things show Mr Clean as unclean?”
Because his secondary school certificate developed wings and flew away, these ‘turenchi’-speaking revolutionists think the major-general is brain-lazy when it comes to logical reasoning. How wrong they are! Like the war general he is, Buhari defended himself logically and fiercely, two weeks ago, when he opened up on the profound logic and ingenuity of how he catches treasury looters.
He said, “Well, like I said, I have learned in the hard way. When I came in uniform, I got those who were leading, took them to Kirikiri (Maximum Prison) and told them they were guilty until they could prove themselves innocent. I put, based on almost all the geopolitical zones, committees to investigate them. Those that were found to have lived beyond their means, the balance was taken and was given to the states. But, I myself was arrested, detained…So, under this system (democracy), which is supposed to be more accountable, it is too slow for my liking, but I have to follow it.”
Between Major-General Buhari and the Nigeria Police Force, I don’t know who borrowed the awesome thief-catching style from the other. Without investigation, the Nigerian police would arrest on mere suspicion and torture till a suspect confesses to a crime never committed. Similarly, Maj.-Gen. Buhari openly confessed, a fortnight ago, that he clamped civilian leaders of the 2nd Republic into jail (without evidence), accused them of guilt and burdened the leaders with the onus of proof. Could this be the reason why many corrupt public officials wriggle out of corruption cases and return home to enjoy their loot today? And many 2nd Republic leaders were discharged and acquitted after they innocently spent numerous months in jail.
The Department of State Services (DSS) has obviously improved on the Buhari Maja-Maja Theory, arresting Sowore and Bakare inside a court in session, detaining them and defying various court orders setting both men free. But when he was dealt, in 1985, the same blow that he dealt others, the major-general whined cowardly and played the victim, saying, “I, myself was arrested, detained…” But he failed to add, “Like I detained others without evidence and trial.”
After that nightmarish coup that shattered his iron rule in 1985, our major-general has lived in morbid fear of coups — a reason many adduced to his reluctance to change his service chiefs despite obvious evidence that they have no answer to the crushing insecurity across the nation. I suspect that the old soldier’s perpetual fear of being toppled underlines his utter intolerance to being challenged or called to question. Some say that’s why Baba gave command of the security organizations in the country to his North, whose sons control the military, DSS, police and all. When the cold-blooded regime bares its fangs against revolutionary protesters and phantom hate speeches, please, know that the major-general is living in abiding fear of losing his crown a second time.

The harvest is plenty but labourers are few,https://punocracy.com/the-harvest-is-plenty-but-the-labourers-are-few/,2019-12-26T09:05:00+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
“But Nigeria said, Mr Bubu, we have been toiling since we gained independence, and have achieved nothing with our Democracy. Yet at your word, I will vote for you. And when they voted Bubu in, the country experienced massive economic growth and development. So Nigeria had to signal to other African countries by opening her borders so that they too can partake of the ease Bubu’s administration has brought upon Nigerians. If they don’t, Nigeria might suffer from over-development”—  Hailers 20 v 15-19
The prophesy in our opening text is already happening. Nigeria is currently suffering from over-development. If we were not, Bubu would not announce a Visa on Arrival policy for all African nations into Nigeria. Who does that, except nations that want others to benefit from the goodies their citizens are enjoying.
Wailers have said this policy isn’t good. What’s not good about it? Nigerians can be selfishsha. There’s love in sharingnah. Wailers want to be enjoying all the improved health care system, motorable roads, economic growth, sound education, and all the benefits of good governance alone.Ahn ahn!Bubu, a man of wisdom and integrity, had to invite other African nations to share in our national prosperity through his immigration policy.
The Nigerian harvest is plenty, but the labourers are few.
We have more than we need, it’s okay to invite friends to a party. Aren’t we alreadybelle-full? We’re now findingbekun-bekun. Some four years ago, China reduced the price of steel in the global market. It affected the sale of other steel producing nations. Their minister for finance later explained that there was a need to do that because they produced in excess. Nigeria must have something in excess that we don’t know about.
There are too many resources in Nigeria, so, we have to open our borders for our African brothers to see the kind of enjoyment Bubu has brought. Over-enjoymentdeh worry us sef.
Well, only a masochist will want to visit Nigeria in its current state.
But then again, since we’ve technically defeated insurgency and insecurity, we don’t need to panic about insecurity — it’s okay to grant people free access into our lands. Nigeria has various intelligence agencies that can track the movements of foreigners round the clock around the country — or is this the systematic gathering of voters from Niger, Chad, Cameroon and co. against the 2023 elections?
Enlightened nations don’t throw their doors open this way. This cannot be the resolution of the African free trade agreement. Let’s wait till others like Rwanda fling their door open first… if Kagame will be so wise to do so. I know for sure that we’re sitting on gunpowder."
One more sure way to become a rich Nigerian,https://punocracy.com/one-more-sure-way-to-become-a-rich-nigerian/,2019-12-26T08:23:18+01:00,"By: Olawale Smart.
Forget what they say about money being between a lion’s teeth. All those “be brave, be hardworking” messages are nonsense; just categorise them askati-kati.
I’m a motivational speaker but I don’t teach you the impossible. Rather than tell you the “if you can see it, you will achieve it” cliché, I will urge you to do everything in your power to purchase the recruitment form of the Nigeria Police Force. If youseethat it is out and you’re not making moves to buy it, surely you will neverachievethis easy and subtle way to become a rich Nigerian.
When you become a police officer in Nigeria, you will have to wear this black on the black uniform. People will call you devil, but pay attention, you will discover it is the voice of poor lasses who are ignorant of a surefire way to make money. As a matter of fact, let black be your best colour pending the time when you will rise through that rank.
I don’t know so many things but I’m sure of the things I know, especially how to make money as a policeman.
I don’t know why and how they go about it, but I know that when you become a police officer, you will be allowed to patrol on streets and at that time you can park your van at a very strategic spots — places where those stubborn bike men and drivers will find it impossible to turn back in their bid to avoid police checks.
You don’t have to care that you are sweating profusely while standing under the sun to discharge your duty; you are a few minutes away from making cool money. Enough to clean your face if you don’t have a handkerchief, with more than enough still in your pocket.
Let me now tell you how it works: For every bike man and every car driver that comes your way, be sure to collect a whopping sum of N50.00 from them.
Let’s do the maths: In two hours, if you are on a busy road, you can collect N50 from nothing less than 100 cars or bikes. That is about N5000 daily and N150,000 monthly, in addition to your already guaranteed bumper salary. Well, you might have to share that with your colleagues; don’t be discouraged. Remember the saying, “if you want to go far, go with people”.
Here are some other beautiful things about the job:
1. You can never go broke: Even if the federal government refuses to pay your salary for months, as a police officer, you will never go broke. Once you have a gun, you can put off your tiring boot, put on slippers, call one of your colleagues and ask a bike man to take you to the nearest road junction.
Not so many people will give you a problem. If any arises, remember that they can never know the law better than you. Ask for their particulars, driver’s licence, a written letter signed by the Chinese President that the car was not made by Aba boys, … you can even charge them for driving alone. Be sure that the intellectual ones who think they can dogra-gradon’t have any case against you in the court of law. This is Nigeria, where court orders can be flaunted.
2. You get the chance to meet top-notch guys: You don’t need to struggle to see politicians or any other celebrities, you’ll get the chance not only to walk closely with them but you will even earn some cash for yourself by mere shielding them from the people. Who cares if they are thieves or lawbreakers? You are their shepherd, they shall not want (or be hurt).
I know there are rumours that police officers live a poverty-stricken life. Don’t mind them, they don’t know the difference between being poor and just being humble. If people get to know that they are making so much money, our people will stop cursing and will not stop calling to ask for help. Also, so that politicians will not feel threatened by their wealth they have ensured that the only similarities you can find between them are their iconicbellies.
Caveat:This writer loves the police force, blames the Nigerian masses for giving them more curse than support but will not fail to preach the need for police officers to develop their self-esteem. He also loves to tell everyone who oppresses the masses that they will end up living the poor lives they try to run away from.
Olawale Smart is an official enemy of mediocrity, preaching exceptionality that comes from the true maximisation of man’s true potentials. Writing is one of the ways he achieves that. He can be contacted through any of these means:olawalesmart50@gmail.com,olawalesmart.com, T\F\I: @Drsmartofficial."
The search for greener pastures│Seun Akioye,https://punocracy.com/the-search-for-greener-pastures%e2%94%82seun-akioye/,2019-12-23T09:20:18+01:00,"Originallypublished via Facebookon June 16, 2017.
I pity young people who abandon their education saying ‘I will continue my schooling abroad’ and they have visiting visas. I pity the young men who dropped promising career here thinking their celebrity status here automatically translates to work in “the abroad of the London or in the America.”
One day, I woke up with what I believed was the solution to all my money, love and career problems. Just one masterpiece of an idea that would level every mountain in my life. Armed with this, I went to my editor at The Source, Hon. Victor Afam Ogene, and told him I was resigning. My colleagues, Edward Dibiana and Olukorede Yishau, felt I was mad. “You this boy, what is wrong with you?” My editor cried. I could not be bothered. I pitied Korede and Eddy, they would end up as veteran journalists if care is not taken. I didn’t want that at all.
That week, I had been promoted from a reporter to senior reporter and my salary doubled to a whopping N12,000. The letter read in part: “Your performance has pleased the management”- yea, darn right.  I was a fairly good journalist and was acquiring a reputation for getting the story no matter how horrible the situation, you could say I had prospects. My plan was simple. I would relocate to London and make it big. A year before, I had taken a fancy to reading all of London’s best writers and I felt I could do as well if not better. I was adamant my life will not move forward if I do not travel out. If I stayed in Lagos, I would grind out in poverty and frustration with N12,000 salary. That was 2003.
I arrived in London in the winter, no jacket, no money save 20 pounds. I was armed with the book 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene — it actually belonged to Adeola Akinremi. I reckoned, by the time I had practised at least 20 of the laws on the white people, I would be rich and famous. As I struggled inside the cold on my way to Woolwich, I was planning which law I would deploy on the editor of The London Telegraph newspaper. I must get a job with that paper and I would start the next day.
I began about a week later, I drafted a fine application letter. My gang in Lagos led by Tosin Orogun had created high tech CVs and fantastic way of writing applications. For instance, we would say: “Dear Editor, I hereby forward to you, the basic pre-requisite as regards my suitability for the above-mentioned position. I have had four years of increasingly progressive experience in the print media…”
I also photocopied some of my ‘greatest’ writings in The Source magazine; I did them in A3 so the Telegraph editor won’t have to squint to read them and posted the bulky envelope. Two weeks later, I received no response, I wrote another letter, nothing. Time was going, I had bills to pay. So I went to a bus stop and copied the addresses of all the leading London newspapers. I would bombard them with my applications, after all, 48 Laws of Power said we should never give up.
I wrote flowery applications to The Times, Guardian and The Independent. No response. I was getting desperate, these people are joking with me, do they know what I can do for them. Then I started calling them, the operator would ask why I wanted to talk to the editor, reluctantly, I would say it has to do with a job.
“Sorry, there is no vacancy at the moment.”
At the moment? So when will there be a vacancy. “Sorry, there is no vacancy at the moment.”
I decided to go lower, to the Daily Mail, the Mirror, Sun, Daily Express, papers I don’t like. It was the same. I felt these people must be racist, it is because I am black. I went even lower, I applied to local newspapers like the free Evening Standard, then Borough papers with barely eight pages in length. I went to the headquarters of The Mail somewhere in Kensington and I was not admitted to see the editor. In desperation, I penned a last letter to the Telegraph editor with the title: I AM ONE OF A KIND, TOO GOOD AN OPPORTUNITY TO IGNORE. I was ignored.
I decided to do something with my talents. I trekked to Old Kent road where I had a complementary card printed with my last money. The card read: JOURNALIST AND MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER. I took out all the notes from my Pastor, Sam Adeyemi and crammed all the seven steps to success and all such things as the Parable of Dollars, Success Tips, Dream Seed.
I would stand at the bus stop and begin to distribute my card. “Oi mate,” I would call to people and begin to introduce myself as a motivational speaker and a journalist, I wasn’t sure if I would get anyone willing to engage an unemployed and hungry motivational speaker. Nobody hired me, no church called me back to speak to their youths, I did not see the light at the end of the tunnel, so one day, I went to Amour security company, owned by one rich Nigerian man called Chief Bala and begged them to get me a job as a security guard.
{Originally publishedhere.}
So I got a job with a security company, I did not have any training nor passion and it was far from my dream job but hunger drove me to accept it. It paid far less than minimum wage and the only way to make any appreciable pay is to do long hours, like 24 or 36 hours at a stretch. When I was called to resume, I actually rolled on the floor in thanksgiving.
But problem number one: The work is in a city called Leicester.
I was to resume at a shop called The Perfume shop in the city centre. I left London on Sunday, checked into a bed and breakfast and in the morning went to the shop. I was dressed in a full uniform (I lost all those wonderful pictures, you will think I am a Group Captain in the Air force), with cap, suit, tie and boots.
The shop attendants—small fine girls like that—welcomed me and commented on how handsome my uniform was and how much handsome I was. I was blushing like a baby.
Customers started coming in, old and young, they would commend my beautiful appearance and my eloquence, I stood by the door blushing and bellowing “Hiya,” “Thanks for shopping, please come again.” (I had spent three days perfecting my British accent).
I was to work from 7am to 7pm on my feet. From the start to like 9 am, I was full of spirit, greeting, helping people and deterring robbers.
Now, the job of a security guard is to catch a thief, many of our people who had no work permit often resort to security work. The company would collect 12 pounds per hour and pay the undocumented Nigerian only 2.50 per hour. At work, your employers expect you to work like you are paid 12 pounds, you will work as someone being paid 2 pounds. Then you must catch a thief, well nothing difficult in that, we catch thieves in Agege and Oshodi. But once you catch him, you will call the police, the police will ask for your name and find you are illegal… next thing is deportation, you see the dilemma?
But I digress. By 12 noon, my legs could no longer support my head, I was having a dizzying feeling, I had been standing for 5 hours. I could no longer smile broadly, I only chuckled. One man called me and I could only mutter “hunm”.
2pm, I had been on my feet for 7 hours. It was no longer funny, I felt some faint sound in my stomach and I began to desecrate the air. I saw my whole life pass in front of me, I could no longer see people coming or going and if armed robbers had stormed that shop I would gladly have helped them carry their bag in exchange for 3 minutes of rest.
By 3pm, something happened. Suddenly, I felt an earthquake, the ground shook and the whole store was turning upside down, this was disaster. I began to scream, “May Day, May Day, this store is gonna fall, everybody out.”
I leaned on the closest wall and held it tight, trying to prevent myself from slipping over as the store began to fall apart. Soon reality dawned, I was hallucinating, there was no earthquake, no May Day.
The people in the store were stunned, the attendants were very disappointed. “Why didn’t you tell us you wanted a quick rest, your break is at 3pm but you could have asked for a rest earlier,” they told me angrily.
An elderly man looked at me, held my shoulders and took me outside to the MacDonald store where I loaded on Double Quarter Pounder burger (I would later become one of the best burger flippers in London) and I regained my strength.
So what happened to the job? Well, I was sacked that evening, the next morning, I left for London in shame and regrets."

When they come in their numbersto offer condolences over the death of your child, you must simply tell them that it is the will of God.
When the depression starts to creep in,you must intensify your prayers,Because depression is not for the children of God.
When the suicidal thoughts trickle in,You must sign up for deliverance sessions.The devil is a liar.
When they tell you that,They love how powerful your voice becomes when you cry during worship,You must not tell them that it is a cry for help.
What you must do,Is show up to church every Sunday and Wednesday,Smile, wave and be strong.
Because you are the church,and nobody must ever see that the god in you is dying.

The ugly National Assembly and beautiful Nigerian roads,https://punocracy.com/the-ugly-national-assembly-and-beautiful-nigerian-roads/,2019-12-20T08:14:16+01:00,"By: Adebayo AbdulRahman Adedayo
Sometimes I find it hard to understand the main problem of the Nigerian citizenry. We bombard our leaders and political office holders with so many demands that Mr President had to address a press conference to explain the geometric fall in his size as a result of how hard he has been working to meet our demands.
Despite this we still find a way to confuse the thunders and paint a not-too-good picture of the government at all tiers, claiming they are not working and we need an overhaul. Someone even managed to take it as far as demanding a revolution.
However, in a bid to fulfil one of his major campaign promises of better infrastructure, Mr Presidenthas approveda meagre sum of just 37 billion naira for the renovation of a building jointly owned by all Nigerians, where our distinguished senators and class…no, federal…reps distribute national assets or discuss national issues as the case may be.
The renovation of the building is coming on the back of the claim by some distinguished lawmakers (if the law still exists) that some microphones — ordinary microphones — are malfunctioning and that the buildings have not been renovated for the past 2000 or maybe 20 years.
We have every reason to celebrate and applaud Mr President for this masses-oriented project that would increase and better the conditions of living in a country some jobless people have tagged the global headquarters of poverty.
No doubt, it is only when lawmakers discuss in a building with the most up-to-date interior design and perfectly working air conditioners that their brains can be in a condition to function well, to think critically, and arrive at more creative methods to carry out their legislative functions. This, of course, most importantly includes budget padding — because it is a naked truth that budget padding is an essential ingredient of economic growth and development. Yet, some lazy Nigerian youth believe the approved amount might be too much…no less.
What they don’t know is that had it been the renovation of the national assembly came ahead of the beautifully imported, made-in-China Social Media Bill rejected by Nigerians on the basis that it was plagiarised, probably our lawmakers would have been in the psychological state of mind to draft a better, much needed and not too plagiarised instrument like an Anti ‘Lai’ Bill, Anti Punch Bill etc.
A critical look at the 2020 budget where the project was included showed and gave a better view of how well the president understands the not-so-many problems of the Nigerian state.
He allocated a whopping N48 billion to cater for the educational needs of the country only in year 2020 and then approved N37 billion for the renovation of the National Assembly building thereby pointing to the fact that there is not much difference between the money required toup-downgradethe education sector and that for the renovation of a building in the Federal Capital Territory.
In a dissimilar situation, the minister for works and housing has announced that Nigerian roads arenot that badand that Nigerians simply prefer to undermine the truth."

Finally, the people of Kuje Prison can now access their Senator, any day, any time. Tell me, which senator in Nigeria is so close to his people than Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, the honourable senator representing the people of Kuje Prison? People at Kuje have been in dire need of a worthy representative all these while, and Orji has finally heeded their call like how PMB answered the call of Nigerians in 2014.
When I told my friend from a more saner clime, he was shocked. “How can one be legislating from the prison?” he inquired. “Why can’t he?” I replied.
Is he not a powerful Nigerian? Are we not in Nigeria? We must be compassionatenah. Prison or no prison, the intellect of Senator Kalu is very much needed in the Senate. Can’t you see how many bills he has sponsored that has helped the masses? Who will not miss that kind of person at the Senate? More so, he will be able to relate properly with the people of Kuje with his enormous experiences as the chief whip of the Senate.
Daddy Rubber Stamp, aka Senate President, categorically said his salaries and allowances will steadily continue to enter his account with the speed of light. And that his seat cannot be declared vacant according to the law. What a good law!
No doubt, our constitution was designed to favour the builders, sorry destroyers, of our national treasury.Abi kinni kaa ti wii, if a constitution agrees with paying allowances to a convicted person and prisoner? These guys designed the constitution with loopholes to enrich themselves and their circle.Awon masses lo daran bayii.
Well, it’s the people of Kuje that will enjoy. More money, more constituency projects.E ma gbadun lo eyin ara Kuje.I hope he truly goes to prison, and it is not the prison that goes to him."

On Thursday evening, democracy visited her supposed lover, Nigeria — and that was when Sowore was released from DSS custody. Nigeria thought she would stay for long. She had dinner in Abuja and slept properly.
Suddenly, she began packing her loads on Friday morning — coinciding with when Sowore was rearrested. There was nothing Nigeria didn’t appease her with.
“Omoge joor, je ka ma gbadun ara waa lo. I have money. Gbogbo awon ore mii gaan like e. Duro timi,”Nigeria begged with all his energy, but she didn’t oblige.
Nigeria didn’t know that democracy already knew about his secret relationship with tranny.
Only God knows what he saw in tyranny. She is nowhere as sweet as democracy. The only time tyranny exhibits good deeds is when it’s in her favour, or when she has plenty to gain. Needless to say, tyranny was very selfish, uncouth and mannerless. As a point of fact, Nigeria fell in love with tyranny when he became a manager at his place of work in 2015, shortly after his babe, democracy, recommended him.
Nigeria’s family will not let him marry tyranny. They want him to marry democracy. Knowing this, Nigeria has been disguising as democracy’s fiancé in public but cheats on her in private with tyranny. Now, nothing is hidden to democracy again.
Democracy was furious as she packed her load.
“Forgive me,” Nigeria said.
“How many times am I supposed to forgive you and your unlawful relationship with tyranny? Seven times?!”
“No, my love. Seventy times seven times. Humans are bound to errnah,” Nigeria said.
The instinct of Nigeria further kicked in. You know, it’s impossible to masquerade as what one really isn’t for a long time. Nigeria started pointing out examples of his friends who are happily married to tyranny’s relatives.
“Can’t you see Cameroon and Paul Biya, Uganda and Yoweri Museveni, Dr Congo and Denis Nguesso, Chad and Idriss Deby? Even Namibia, Togo, Djibouti and the likes are married to tyranny’s close relatives. It is only recently that death made Zimbabwe part ways with tyranny’s elder sister.
“It is true you are a source of happiness to me and my family but, I must confess, I can’t do without tyranny. Can both of you share me together?”
Democracy left without uttering another word. Please, help us beg her to return home. Nigeria will not do it again. Every room, including the courtroom and the other room, must be controlled by democracy."
"With all the condolence letters, none was sent to Mr Democracy’s family",https://punocracy.com/with-all-the-condolence-letters-none-was-sent-to-mr-democracys-family/,2019-12-12T08:58:17+01:00,"By:  Olamide Francis.
There’s no way a human being with flesh and blood, with ‘human feelings’ would not pay a condolence visit to the relatives of Democracy. It’s painful.
Last Saturday, as usual, three condolences letters rolled out of the Nigerian presidency, but none was sent to the family of Mr Democracy.Abi, they don’t know he finally breathed his last on Friday morning? Maybe they prefer to visit his family in person. No, Vice President Osinbajo isn’t so inhumane. He’s a regular condolence visitor and a vibrant leader of the condolence delegate. This death of Mr Democracy should definitely be on his list of preference for this week.
Democracy was a good man.
He loved everyone, listens to all and sundry. I have never seen him exhibit an act of belligerency. He treats everyone equally and is a respecter of nobody. You need to see how awesome he was. From fulfilling all he promised, giving the power of choice to the people to letting everyone’s voice be heard… Oh, he was such a nice man!
Unfortunately, after a long ailment, he passed away on Friday.
All these months, he has been bedridden at the Federal Medical Center, Aso Villa. As a point of fact, he was been attended to by Dr Buhari. Prior to this time, everycompos mentisNigerian has argued if it’s okay to let Dr Buhari keep attending to his health. Hailers presented him as a veteran in nurturing Democracy. I was bewildered.
“But, he killed Mr Democracy’s father in 1983nah? How can he now care for the son?”
You can’t give what you don’t havekeh. If you ask me, I’ll say his doctoral certificate is an affidavit. No relative of Democracy has ever blossomed in his hands. There was nothing I didn’t say in 2015 about the danger Mr democracy will be in if we let Dr Buhari attend to him.
In 2019, Mr Democracy’s condition further deteriorated, but those who know what’s best for Nigeria still voted for Dr Buhari to carry on with his work. According to them, he was the best consultant for the job, an Angel from above. A lot has been spent on Mr Democracy. He even celebrated his 20th year of uninterrupted service to the Federal Republic this year. Little did I know he’d die this same year.
Alas, he passed away on Friday in the most horrible way, right in front of those who could have saved his life, the Democracy Safekeeping Service (DSS).
When we retrieved the autopsy of Democracy, we found out he was poisoned to death by tyranny. Ah! Tyranny! Tyranny that killed Democracy’s uncle, sisters and in-laws in Cameron, Zimbabwe, Togo, Uganda and the likes. We have to ask Dr Buhari — the epitome of no-nonsense that he is — how the poison was smuggled into Democracy’s room at the hospital. There’s no way we will not investigate Dr Buhari, he must know one or many things about this issue.
His faction in the hospital has been supporting him ever since. They said Democracy isn’t dead, that he only faked his death. Some said, Dr Buhari knows nothing about his death. Unfortunately, Dr Buhari and his cohorts have been playing deaf and dumb since Friday that Democracy died.
Who will bell the cat? Democracy was a good man. We cannot let his death go in vain. Should we organise a national day of fasting and prayer for his resurrection? Please advise us.

Politics in Nigeria becomes more difficult as the years go by. The idea of progression in Nigeria’s vocabulary is making things more difficult. In fact, if there were a “Nigerian Advanced Learners’ Dictionary”, the word “Progress” would have its first synonym as “Sophisticated”.
This is a reality that goes beyond politics but extends to education, health, entertainment and every other sector. In saner climes, however, an applaudable development is when a previously sophisticated process is made easy, but you must understand that when God cursed Adam that he would sweat before putting food on the table, he allotted that to his Nigerian descendants and gave his other favourable qualities to the abroad.
This explains why as a Nigerianyou must lose weightas evidence of hard work … otherwise, you are a lazy Nigerian (youth).
I was hoping our sacred politics would not be roped into this, at least to keep the fire in some of us that have political aspirations. Aspirations we were hoping to actualise in 50 years time (“tomorrow”) when we become youths like President Buhari and his contemporaries. But Nigeria doesn’t ever give you what you want. You only get what she thinks you need. (Sai Baba!)
I remember when all it took to garner votes in Nigeria was to be patriotic, academically qualified, have a valid vision for the country and impactful solutions to existing problems in your manifesto. That simple. It was so simple that few swallowed their pride and followed it to the letter. The others who didn’t claimed they were too good for easy and chose to tread a more difficult path.
Some of them overlooked the academic requirement because I mean everyone can become a professor, and opted for a more strenuous qualification like fake WAEC results, fake NYSC certificates. Others abandoned vision and chose to hire storytellers who would come up with enticing stories about their ‘humble’ backgrounds. Stories they shared in campaigns. If not sadism, why go through the stress of talking about yourself, instead of the easier option that is, a critical delivery before the electorates of your intentions if voted for? Do they not realise that telling a story is more difficult than engaging your brain in critical discourse?
It didn’t stop there. No, this was like the first swim into the difficulty mainstream. It advanced to making empty promises in campaigns, ridiculous ones yet told with a straight face. Ah!This politics sef!
Do you know what it takes to lie without your body gestures giving you up? Or pledging to do something you know you won’t do even if given a decade, without that conscience thingy haunting you down? Not just before one or two persons, but a crowd and National TV. What if your Mum is watching and chooses to beat you up for lying? So that an Instablog headline like, “Presidential candidate gets beat up by Mum, for saying he would equate one naira to one dollar if voted for on National TV” would then go viral and just like that, your career is tainted.
Lying is an art; an arduous one. If that falsehood ain’t innate, you must acquire the skill in the “School of Lai”. Graduating with a distinction from the “School of Lai” has turned the crux of the requirements for a political office. Please bring back our genuineness. That was way easier. Sincerity needs no training.
It keeps deteriorating as the years go by, and politics is becoming more complicated. Now they say that to win an election, you mustgo on your knees and begfor votes. Chai! There is Godo.
If you can’t, then there should be a willing relation preferably a Godfather who would carry out the exercise on your behalf, while you stand upright smiling. Such relation must, however, expose your 40-year boyhood, and admit your expected incompetence.
If you are a rerun contender, it is expected that he should admit you messed up in your past regime, but credit it to your naivety especially if you are 40. You know how 40-year-olds think like toddlersna? So the failure was natural. He should then promise that you’d do better if given another chance. A blatant lie; but remember if he has mastered the art, especially the kind offered in the “School of Lai”, your Godfather can make it very believable. Also remember, all this must be done while he is kneeling.
In their defence though, since what the average Nigerian does is beg, and our leaders should lead by example, maybe the whole idea of begging for votes is for representation. To show Nigerians that they are not alone and maybe to showcase how begging can be done frivolously. Well, this development even though difficult is commendable. Kudos! Nigerian politics.
I can’t but express optimism then in the Neo-Nigerian Politics. The inclusion agenda is unique and praiseworthy. What next? Represent the thousand jobless Nigerian graduates by lying down during campaigns? Beautiful!

"It’s hard to impress a Nigerian, except your name is Seyi Makinde",https://punocracy.com/its-hard-to-impress-a-nigerian-except-your-name-is-seyi-makinde/,2019-12-12T08:18:48+01:00,"​By: Chuks. Chinyere(jj)
Trying to impress Nigerians is a hard job. Don’t argue with me, I’ve been a Nigerian a long time.
Scrolling through my phone, I lift my head to announce to my friends the devastating effects of global warming, or maybe how hellfire is starting to build up on us and how there’s a big bad thing prepping to happen.
“Before now it was a bush fire in Brazil, now it’s New South Wales in Australia and Sydney too in the same country. Terrible things are really happening in this Worldo. The other day there was a disaster. A volcanic eruption happened somewhere in New Zealand, took the life of one person this…”
“Wait. One person. Just one person died in a whole volcano?”
“Which kind disaster be that wey only one person dey die, I was expecting to hear like 747 people. Mtchew, make them come Naija come see disaster na.”
It’s really a hard thing to do, trying to impress Nigerians with bad news. We have been through so much. I mean how do you begin to wow an average Nigerian with a corruption saga of another country. Can it beat a snake swallowing N36 million?
I remember a certain man who died trying to please Nigerians — or should I say he died trying to do the right things. (Unfortunately, the right things don’t please Nigerians.)
It only took a man like Major General Buhari as President to have us begin to appreciate the saints in Goodluck Jonathan and his former boss, Umaru Musa Yar’adua.
I started following politics and reading dailies after the 2007 General Elections, and I can not remember reading a single headline or column anywhere, which was praising the enviable achievements of the then Yar’adua administration. There were cartoonists making fun of this man for laying out a clear seven-point agenda and promising to follow the due process and respect the Rule of Law in all his doings. Yet when this man became critically ill, in service to us, nobody stood by him or showed him support. Everyone was calling for his resignation and he’s head with it. Who knew if our love could have saved him and given him a reason to fight and conquer that cancer? Well, this is possibly why God blessed us withmanslike Major-General Muhammadu Buhari.
You know what they say,“Person wey suffer suppose get sense.”Having a bad taste in your mouth long enough will teach you how to appreciate the sweetness of honey.
There is almost never a day I take my daily stroll through the streets of social media, Twitter especially, without hearing hearty chants of the wonders of Governor Seyi Makinde. This man seems to be doing so much in Oyo State, it’s beginning to become suspicious.
I heard this man made a little over N57 million available for Maths and English “extra lessons” for SSS 3 students across all Oyo State Government-owned schools; isn’t that just “ridicule-us?” Yes! This man is trying to ridicule us. So he knows how to prioritise education like this, he knows the business of Governance so well, and yet decided to keep himself in hiding all these while allowing Umu Africa to continue in sufferance? He must be sued for this nonsense.
Wait, what did I just hear? Governor Seyi Makinde slashed the LAUTECH fees from N250,000 to a staggering N65,000? No, no that’s unacceptable. What is he trying to do, make education cheap or what? This man is trying to impress me, I don’t like being impressed,biko.
That’s not all? You guys should wait, I’m hearing something about the Oyo State 2020 budget. HE DID WHAT? Allotted 22.3 per cent of the state budget to education alone? That’s hitting the UNESCO benchmarknah; it’s unbelievable. What is this man trying to dona? Is it that he doesn’t want a second term or what? If you end up educating the entire Oyo State in your first four years, how then do you intend to win re-election in 2023?
I mean, with all the young men getting an education and trying to do better with their lives, how do you find uneducated thugs to help with ballot snatching, stuffing, and that electoral violence Baba Adedibu thought us before he passed on and passed the baton to Yahaya Bello?
This man is just something. I am suspecting him to be an uncaring husband and father. Okay, he might care about his immediate family but it’s obvious he doesn’t care about his fourth and fifth generations unborn. You can’t tell me otherwise, ’cause if he does care about them I don’t see any reason why he will promise to give an account of every kobo to be spent from the over N208 billion 2020 budget of Oyo State. How then does he plan to sideline some “ doe” for future use?You sef reason am na.
I’m really in shock. Seyi Makinde’s doings is beyond suspicious. We are all in a country where there’s no money; poor man is crying; big man deyhala. The Federal Government is borrowing us into eternal debt; uncompleted projects litter the entire country, leaving everywhere looking like an abattoir. Yet, this Governor Seyi Makinde of a guy is somehow finding it possible to make over N1 billion available for owed pensioners to get paid? That’s it;I can not can anymore. At this point, I might have to protest.
Wait o, looks like I’m not the only bad belle in the building o. Looks like the children ofAnimals Promising Change, also known as APC, have beaten me to this protest.
“Ajimobi has employed 1000 in 8 years, Seyi Makinde has employed 10,000 in less than a year.”
These are the Saul vs David like songs of praise we’ve been hearing them sing all over social media for months now, and APC bots are not having it, for obvious reasons of course.
I cannot say what Former Governor Ajimobi was thinking when he proclaimed the achievements of his administration as “the pinnacle of governmental achievements”. It’s not like I disagree with him, there won’t be another Governor of Oyo State whose performance will possibly match up to his “flood”. Governor Seyi Makinde has changed that forever by raising a standard against him. It will take more than printing the face of a good man on “okada shelters” to tarnish the image of a good man; a good man who has cracked the code to pleasing Nigerians with effortless deeds."

"Buhairy buys new toilet called ‘Rule of Law’, says he enjoys shitting on it",https://punocracy.com/buhairy-buys-new-toilet-called-rule-of-law-says-he-enjoys-shitting-on-it/,2019-12-07T09:05:26+01:00,"ASO ROCK (The T.A. Report)― Ruler of Nigeria, President Mahmud Buhairy, has picked up a new hobby of shitting regularly and delightfully on the “Rule of Law”, which his aides say is the name of a water closet that has recently been ordered from China.
Explaining the president’s strange toilet hobbies to the T.A. Report, presidential spokesman Garuba Shior said, since the new acquisition, Buhairy has spent more time in the restroom than he has in his office or even his (otherwise highly cherished)other room.
“Every year, Mr President buys toilets that go by many strange names,” Shior explained. “One time, he bought a big one from Greece calledEconomy. At another period during his first term, he ordered one from Singapore that was namedFreedom of Expressionand another one from the United Kingdom withNigerian Healthcarewritten boldly on it.”
“But since he bought this one labelledRule of Law, he’s told me he didn’t know taking a dump could be so pleasurable,” the Special Adviser to the President chuckled, reflexively placing his palm over his lips as if he had just remembered his comments could be considered hate speech.
The only other people with access to Buhairy’s odd restroom are top officials of the Department of State Savages (DSS), who help arrest the situation when things don’t exactly go according to plan, one source at the statehouse told our correspondent.
“It’s been rumoured especially among the DSS operatives whose job it is to clean up after the president that he reserves his stinkiest, most tremendous shit for theRule of Law,” the source said.
“When he’s using the toilet, he does so with so much relish and good grace you’d think he was an Olympic gold medalist in Shitting on Things You Don’t Give a Shit About.”
Several statehouse employees say the water closet might have already started having cracks due to extended use.
“Only God knows where he’ll decide to be evacuating his bowels once theRule of Lawis damaged beyond repair,” one wondered. “An aide close to the president said, only a few days ago, he saw him casually placing an order for aLives and Propertieswater closet on AliExpress.”

Did I hear you say, “This is an exaggeration, Sowore is nothing close to a Martyr”? Well don’t blame me, blame the Federal Government and the Department of State Services for setting thehyber-ballrolling by raping the Rule of Law that begat the democracy we once enjoyed—a beaten and bruised democracy we can no longer recognise.
If I love Nigerians for anything, it’s our ability to identify the root of our every problem and continually tackle it. Everything wrong in Nigeria, from the price of rice to the increased scorch of the Lagos sun, from the increased slope in autocratic wife-beating to the number of lazy yahoo boys, is the singular fault of the President. One man, many, every fault.
When the top is bad and“impunitious”, when the President displays a flagrant disregard for court orders and the rule of law that made his office worth occupying, decadence trickles down to the bottom from the top, thereby making the apex the root of the problem. But, you know, the bottom had nothing to do with installing the top, the bottom did not sell four years’ worth of governance for two thousand naira, the bottom did not buy lies and sell the truth, the bottom had no hand in their own predicament.
Seeeh, as bad as the situation is,something no dey bad finish.There’s always a good side to flagrant abuse of power and the almost sexual abuse of the rule of law. Look at it this way; during our endless online squabbles with South African Twitter, our brothers have never at any point in time boasted of having a man like Nelson Mandela, a renowned freedom fighter and human rights activist. We should count ourselves lucky for this. It’s not every day a country is able to boast of a man who is ready to die for his people, a man who has put his life on the line and won freedom for his people. There’s only a handful of countries, from time, that could boast of someone like Nelson Mandela. At the moment, Nigeria does not have a match for him. Sooner or later, South Africans will begin to taunt us for this, and this is why our President and his team of forward-thinkers have gone ahead to make a Mandela of our own. With the help of gangsterism as Femi Falana put it, with the aid of dictatorial muscle flexing and enablement of one institution to abuse another as my father put, our dear Buhari-led administration is making a Martyr out of ‘Yele Sowore, and we should all be happy andgreat-foolfor this. Finally, there will be something to brag about!
Who is Omoyele Sowore?
As of 1989, at age 18, Sowore was amongst the Great Nigerian Students who came out to make sure the number of Nigerian Universities was not chopped down from 28 to 5, all in a bid to meet the ludicrous requirements for a $120 million IMF loan for oil pipeline projects.
It was said that Sowore was unlawfully arrested and tortured on several occasions in connection to the June 12, 1993, elections, his role in the clamour for a democratic government and his undying love and activism for Nigeria.
In 2015, Sowore was instrumental in installing Muhammadu Buhari as President, joining hands with many other Nigerians to remove an incumbent from office for the first time in Nigerian history — a surgery that has proven to be both a blessing and a curse.
2019, Sowore decides to replace the man he helped install and ran for President. He promised to help us make more money from Marijuana than we have ever made from exporting crude oil and boys were excited … but Sowore failed at the polls, only to allow a failure to continue failing. Now? Sowore has taken another route, not necessarily in a ploy to unseat a sitting President but to demand a sitting President stand up to the job of serving the people.
Obviously Muhammadu Buhari doesn’t not appreciate such wanton disrespect and ludicrous demands. As my Dad would say, “It’s your job to understand me and not my job to please you”, typical African Parenting style, and this is the same vibe our “father of the nation” President Muhammadu Buhari is giving us. We have to understand that our President of high impeccable integrity loathes a number of things. We must then learn and understand these things so that we can do away with them.
First on the list is Court Orders and the overall supremacy of the Rule of Law. Let’s put ourselves in President Buhari’s shoes, just one time. How would you feel if you were asked to take orders from someone younger than you and whose monthly salaries come from your pocket… just because they wear a white wig and a black gown, just because they get to strike their table with a hammer that cannot drive an office pin into a shoe sole after making ludicrous assertions and demands.You sef check am, e make sense?
It’s not like the money being used to pay these judges belongs to the President o, but he’s the President and the number one man in the country, so the money should belong to him, yeah? Since he’s the one paying for their feeding and everything, what right do they have to tell him what to do? Especially when it bothers on releasing his enemies, men like Dasuki and Sowore whoapparentlydeserve to rot in jail for.
If the Rule of Law was so supreme, it should protect itself from beingSoworaped. Imagine telling a renowned rapist with a very fat sex offender record about how wrong it is to have canal knowledge of an underaged child. “Women have the right to wear what they want, it doesn’t mean you must abuse them.” None of those words makes sense to a rapist. “I have power and they don’t, and so I have the right to have my way anyway I feel like.”
Public protests for political and social change can also get on our President’s nerve, anothercrimeSowore is guilty of.
In 2015, the APC promised to give Nigeria “change” although they didn’t specify exactly what type of change they were giving, and they presented Muhammadu Buhari as the mascot and bringer of this change. Nigerians accepted. I cannot say Nigerians are pleased with this change Buhari and the APC have brought them, but it doesn’t matter. This relationship is for better and for worse. Things take time before they really get better, after a long period of time undergoing distortion. You cannot have this APC in government and begin clamouring for a new change barely eight years into the change they are offering. You have to finish the plate of food before ordering for more, whether you like the taste or not. Courtesy demands this from us.
We have to wait for at least sixteen years to be sure we don’t like Buhari’s type of change. Yes, sixteen years! We can change the constitution to make sure President Buhari effects the type of change he has in store for Nigeria. We can’t allow mans like ‘Yele begin to clamour for someyeyesocial and political change so soon, this is why he has to spend some years in DSS’ beer parlour to cool off. What nonsense.
A few others include a free press, freedom of expression, and the collective power of the people. If that social media bill had been passed now, at least this Sowore noise on Twitter wouldn’t have been so loud to overshadow the waves Wizkid’s new EP was making. What a loss to our economy!
“My People perish because of lack of knowledge”. If we learn the important things and abide by the rules and regulations of this Buhari administration, we won’t be having these kinds of problems that warrant Judges to take cover in their courtrooms that have become war zones or situations where Femi Falana and the DSS have to play fast and furious,abi na police and thief we wan call am?
Umu Nigeria, Freedom is not free, the press can’t be allowed to report freely because their owners are either enemies of the government or potential enemies, people like Sowore and co. The people do not deserve a collective power because they don’t know what they want. If you don’t know that N30,000 is more than enough to sustain a family of six for over a month, how then do you know what is good for you? If you don’t know that we have rice in Kano, what right do you have to make a collective demand from the government? If you don’t know that N30 can give you a square meal anywhere in Nigeria, what right do you have to demand that the government who you have voted in serve you or relate to you the demands they have made to the Benin Republic Government that warranted the closure of the Seme Border?
If you disagree with me on how we should live life under this Buhari regime, you have a number of options. You could come out and protest with sticks and stones — at the risk of gettingSoworapedof course. You could sit in one corner of your bed, close to that socket, tweeting away on the hashtags that Jack made for you. At least you have power and fuel plus data is not that expensive for you; you have made it in life. Or you could justgba kamuand keep enjoying the endless dividends of aSoworapedDemocracy, Udo!

Jackboots and gunpoints are the order of the day, the nation is in a state of anarchy as litigants taking their cue from the Federal and State governments have refused to obey orders emanating from the courts. The courts having been rendered practically useless and stripped of their powers like “de black panther” have gone on indefinite vacation. Na “who sabi pesin pass” dey reign as the law of the day and every “gbas” is met with an even more effective “gbos“.
In the midst of all these lies our protagonist; Mustapha; a DSS Commander.
From our God-eye view, we see Mustapha basking in exultation. He has just returned from a successful bust. He and his team of battle-hardened officers have just raided a safe house in Yaba where dissidents who were clamouring against the third term bid of Daddy Bubu the everlasting had set up shop.How dare they oppose Bubu the magnificent? How dare they?? Shouting Constitution upandan the online attempting to truncate Bubu’s good works… The bloody civilians.
Anyways, he and his boys had taught them the lesson of their lives. Come and see battering and brutalising, knocked out teeth flying here and there like hailstones. Ha… He was proud of his boys. Especially that one they called Danku. The boy had nerves of steel in him. The way he shot that one that went by the moniker @DrD4Democracy in the head after pummeling him to a pulp still sent the natural fear of God in him. They would brook no dissent, they were the law, and the law would not be mocked. Not on his watch.Astaghfirullahthat his daddy; Bubu would not reign Supreme till he drew his last breath…

Vision 2020: Death by Taxation!,https://punocracy.com/vision-2020-death-by-taxation/,2019-12-05T18:34:36+01:00,"2020 is around the corner and guess what? The Nigerian government is going to tax us all to death. The taxman is coming for us all!
This notion is particularly reinforced by the imminence of the Finance Bill, 2019 which was presented to a Joint session of the National Assembly by Daddy Bubu for hearing. You see, ordinarily, what the National Assembly does when a bill is to be introduced like that is that the bill is first introduced in one of the two houses who deliberates on it before it is passed on to the other house for deliberation. Butko si oil money mo, our leaders have finished embezzling it all and they need an alternate source of income to keep the cash flowing.
Thus, from 2nd January, 2020 which is the proposed implementation date of the law,  all Nigerians both old and young, fat or skinny, employed or unemployed must have a tax identification number (TIN) unique to them alone; associated with their bank account numbers. So if you know you don’t want your money to enter voicemail within the period it will take you to obtain your TIN, biko, send me a dm, I’m sellingKoloat affordable prices. After you buy yourKolo(from me of course) go to your bank, withdraw all your money and keep it inside theKolo; strategically placed under your bed. Can the Government tax what it cannot see?
I know a number of youalaigboranswill be doingorikunkunnow and be asking jamb questions like why should you pay tax. Why should you pay tax when you’re already providing for yourself what the government should provide for you with the tax money? Because:
Electricity  – You have generators and inverters which you bought with your own money to generate power for you and where the government even deigns to provide the light for you gan, you contributed money for meter and transformer which they have still not installed after seven years;
Water – Your State does not even have a water corporation talk less of providing you water. You have been providing potable water for yourself since 19gbogboro from the wells and boreholes you have dug for yourselves;
Security –  Youradugbohas a baba you pay every month your “tax” money to burn tyres in the middle of the night and walk all around the neighbourhood in the name of securing your lives and properties from men of the underworld.
Even the roads they claim to fix gan are a challenge. You have more  potholes than you have roads. You and your neighbours particularly those of you that live in Lekki have made it your civic duty to fix government’s road for them simply because; that your small muscle which you have  hustled to buy because you cannot be fightingAgberoevery day to enter  smelling Danfo, due to the poor public transportation system must see road to at least go and mark attendance inside traffic.
In a nutshell, you are your own government, Vision 2020ti lazzdentand believe me you, I totally understand. Afterall, am i not a Nigerian like you?
But if you will hear my own,ti e lo’n so yen. This is Nigeria, and your concerns no matter how legitimate, are not valid. Come 2nd January, 2020; God willing that the Government has its way, it’s either you have your TIN or you have yourKolo.Ko si oroI did not know there.
Awon Oloyinbo ma’n so kini kan; “a word they say is enough for the wise”ni won ma’n pe.  A word they say is shey kini?
Shalom.

Hey big aun​​ty, what’s good? How is the family? How was your flight from London? And how is Yusuf’s head? I know it was a long time since the accident; just trying to make sure ourbiker miceis in good health. You know these kinds of accident used to cause mentalskor skor. If he’s fine, glory be to God.
What’s up? Hope the daughters of Mamman Daura aren’t giving youwahalaagain. How about the other woman trying to take your place in the other room? Hope our intel on social media was able to stifle the plans of our enemies. Aunty Aisha, you too much o. After you,nayou o. See as you fine anyhow. But these days though, you’re looking more like 2face Idibia, without theskodos, what’s up with that?
I logged on Twitter to see your name trending. I was excited that our matron was back at giving the cabal their usual dose ofgbasandgbos, only for me to get the shocker of my life. I don’t know what surprised me the most, that you were making references to China or that you were encouraging those small boys in the Senate to take away our social media that has saved your marriage more times than a therapist.
When Peter Obi was making references to China during his debate against your starboy, your people were busy complaining o. Now you want to emulate China to regulate Social Media and kill democracy? What really is your plan?
See eh, na small thing dey make me vex, still I no dey quick vex. I am not fond of writing letters like Baba Iyabo… When your aide carried N2 billion, did I write you so long a letter? Did anybody ask how one of your gum-body maids managed to get their hands on that much money? Did anybody recommend we copy China in the execution of public looters? NO!
When Yusuf went crashing his head while speed-riding an over N200 million worth of automobile, did I write you a letter? Did anyone recommend a made-in-China solution? Ask questions why he wasn’t doing his homework at the time? NO!
So why are you now recommending the Chinese dressing in our Twitter that we are managingna? What side are you onsef? One minute, you’re calling out The Cabals, the next minute you’re endorsing a failure for second term. One minute, you’re forming Mother Theresa, the next minute your show collection is competing with Rihanna’s. Sango and Amadioha said I should tell you to pick a side and stick to it. They don’t like blessing innocent people; they only have business with the wicked. Have some respect and stop confusing the deities.
I am trying to understand why you and the rest of the ruling class like to selectively copy. Maybe to selectively copy is the best and we the masses are too blind to understand this. You copy audio Presidency from Biya, and then copy Presidential vulgarity from Donald Trump. You copy lies and deceit from Boris. Sorry that’s an insult; Boris doesn’t have Lai Mohammed on his team; he’s even still learning how to lie properly. Still in the business of copying, we refuse to copy the economic policies of Singapore, but it’s perfect to plagiarise an entire bill without changing a single word.
Kai, I think I have lost track of the subject of this my letter. Seeeh, Aunty Aisha, the Nigerian People said I should greet you, they said you are doing very well. No mother of any nation hasmurderedlike you and we are really proud.
As you continue to support the murder of the Nigerian voice, as you continue to give your blessing to those who continue to trample and choke on the neck of the common man, in “tryance” of killing our voice, I just want to tell you that you people will fail. Because boys will build a VPN. Jack loves Nigerian Twitter, he’ll find a way to keep us there, and we will continue to talk about you.
Don’t worry about whether or not we are going to occupy the streets, that’s probably never going to happen, becausewe no wan die, we wan chop life, papa dey for house, we wan build house; so no matter how hard you and your peers push us to the wall, we will find a way to break the wall and move backwards.Una go push us, pushing go tire una, if una say una stubborn, we go show you say we stubborn pass una.
Aunty Aisha, please continue the good work; don’t relent in getting the latest Birkin and Armani. You deserve it, girl. Just make sure you’re standing very far from your wardrobe when Amadioha and Sango send their gift; it will be a shame to lose all those pricey bags and shoes to the fire of thunder."

​Nigerians are very hardworking people, with little or no result to show for all the efforts we put in. This is not a result of the black hole of a system we have found ourselves in, that swallows your efforts without results. It is rather because of forefathers who had dedicated their destinies and those of their fore-children to all kinds oforishasand deities.
As a result, we need to pay for prayers, we need to pay our tithes and offerings regularly to our Daddy GOs so that these curses will be broken and so that we can progress. The present situation has nothing to do with bad governance at all.
There’s so much traffic in Lagos, it’s a gridlock on some days — but not as a result of the bad roads we have in the state o!nah nah! it’s just that Lagos is a land of opportunities and, as a Mega City, there’s an astronomical increase in population …thus the traffic jam. The problem is not a terrible transport system unable to cater for this “astronomical population growth”. Looking on the bright side, car owners now envy trekkers and Okada riders. The table is turning, and new businesses like Opay are now selling more and thriving — talk about ease of doing business.
Nigerians are suffocating. Poverty and hardship have them on a chokehold. With their feet on our neck, our oppressors are those we now worship.
Oops! That came out wrong. The truth is, Nigerians are enjoying and chopping life. After all, inner peacelo she koko. Contentment is the most important thingabeg. It is better to at least see one square meal and be happy. Besides, “Some have food but KANO eat.” We should be happy that the rich also cry. No matter how bad it is for you,e get people wey you better pass.
So when you get to Church on Sunday, give an extra offering to the continuously fattened pocket of your religious patriarch for the God-given ability to suffer and smile. At least long-suffering is one of the nine gifts.
“MY PEOPLE DEY FEAR TOO MUUUUUUCHHHH!!! We fear the things we no seeee, we no wan die, we no wan kpai, we wan build house, we wan knack nyash, we wan chop life, we wan killi dem kpa, we wan drive benz”…but year don dey end, guy,and a Governor who owed workers salaries for 30 months out of his 48 months period as Governor was re-elected into office on the grounds of Youth Empowerment. Our young Governor is so in touch with his youth that he took it upon himself to tackle youthful unemployment in Kogi State by empowering Kogi youths with clubs and machetes, sticks and stones and, not forgetting, an impetus to wreak havoc. Don’t you just love youth empowerment?
This kind gesture was so touching that Natasha Akpoti, governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), could not hold back tears whenever she narrated what she passed through in the hands of these unemployed-empowered employees of Governor Yahaya Bello. Natasha would have made a terrific Governor, but the people of Kogi said, “No, she didn’t know how to smile well enough like the amiable Governor Yahaya Bello.”
Some people think the All Progressives Congress government is not a very smart one. Some think they are dull and unintelligent. But if you can see with both eyes and you let a blind man lead you, what does that say about you, your eyes, and your faith in your eyes?
You think these people are not working hard? I laugh. If they worked hard to give you a good economy, good-paying jobs, and a minimum wage of N100,000, how then will you be able to sell your vote for N2,000? This is why they work hard to keep you poor, so that poverty will, in turn, have you work for them too. You think you’re the only one who read The Richest Man In Babylon?
If we had good roads in Lagos, less traffic jam, and less time spent on the road in general, how will advertisers who pay huge sums to advert regulatory authorities cash out on these massive investments? Okay, maybe I’m over-reaching.
Maybe they all mean well. Maybe this Social Media Bill thing is indeed not in a bid to bridle out sharp tongues and Twitter fingers. Maybe it’s a progressive ploy to open doors to a new economic opportunity to tech guys who will help us build VPN apps to help change our locations like Yahoo boys, just so that we can flex our Twitter finger muscles and speak our minds.
It used to be United We Stand… look around you, it is united they stand against us, and “they” here is every member of the upper class in a position of power. They stay powerful by dividing us into smaller groups, keeping us standing divided against ourselves. There was a country, where we stood united so that we didn’t fall. Now, we stand united in divided groups to fall divided in unison … standing too far from each other, so that we don’t find our collective voice to say, ‘ENOUGH!’

"Satire 0-1 News: Missing INEC staff, Sowore may be knocked down if released, and other stories",https://punocracy.com/satire-0-1-news-missing-inec-staff-sowore/,2019-11-23T09:09:27+01:00,"Facts are oftentimes stranger than fiction just as news is oftentimes more hilarious than satire. We live in a world (or country?) where journalists have, without intending it, become greater comedians than professional humorists. Don’t believe us? Keep reading.
The electoral commission, INEC, has declared 30 of its staff missing. The ad-hoc staff took part in Saturday’s Kogi State governorship election. They were posted to Olamaboro Local Government Area (LGA) by the commission. They were declared missing around 1 a.m. on Sunday during the final collation of results in the local government. The missing INEC staff include Presiding Officers (POs) and Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) of polling units in Imane ward 1 and 2 of Olamaboro LGA of Kogi State.
Policemen deployed at polling unit 006, Asuta ward, Kabba/Bunu local government area of Kogi state, fled on Saturday after suspected thugs took over the unit. At least five of the officers escaped through a nearby bush shortly after irate youth surrounded the voting area, destroying election materials. The rate of violence has been high in Kabba/Bunu, where senatorial and governorship elections are holding.
The Department of State Services, DSS, on Tuesday said it can’t release, Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement from its detention facility because he may be knocked down by a vehicle on his way out. DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya made the disclosure while addressing journalists in Abuja. Afunanya said, “We cannot just release Sowore and ask him to go because he may be knocked down by a vehicle at the gate.”
Preliminary investigation revealed that the convict, against established standard practice, had access to internet and mobile phone in the Correctional Centre where he is supposed to be serving his jail term. Even more puzzling was the finding that Mr Aroke got himself admitted to the Nigeria Police Hospital, Falomo, Lagos for an undisclosed ailment. And from the hospital, he would move out to lodge in hotels, meet with his wife and two children and attend other social functions … The convict was also in possession of his wife’s bank account token in prison, which he used to freely transfer funds. Further investigation revealed that, while his trial was ongoing in 2015, Mr Aroke bought a four-bedroom duplex at Plot 12, Deji Fadoju Street, Megamounds Estate Lekki County Homes, Lekki for N48 million.
Okafor said: “I call on all Heads of Blocks, State Chairmen and other Stakeholders of Christian Association of Nigeria South-East Zone to take up aggressive prayers against the planned convention of Witches and Wizards slated to hold on November 26 at UNN. This convention is not of God and must not hold in Jesus name. Exodus 22:18 says, ‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’. I hereby direct, all Christian Churches in South East of Nigerian to take up lamentation and pray against this evil movement in all our churches this coming Sunday. I also call upon all Christian Campus Fellowship Groups and other Christian Students’ Associations to join in this effort and stand up for JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD against this evil development in South East Of NIGERIA.”
“Many people say Yahaya Bello is young; that he has fought many people. For every one that the governor has offended, I’m asking all of you to forgive him. He is young; he is supposed to make mistakes. When you are young, you make mistakes but you learn from them,” el-Rufai said. “On his behalf, I’m kneeling down, to beg all of you to forgive Yahaya Bello if he has offended you. He cares about the people of Kogi State. He cares about this state. He has brought progress to this state; he has brought young people and women into government.”
Fowler made this known on Monday while speaking to TheCable on the sidelines of the ongoing Nigerian Economic Summit Group conference holding in Transcorp Hilton in Abuja. “I will put it this way, Nigerians talk a lot on the phone; they even talk more than is required so for them to have capacity or revenue to talk that much, I don’t see any harm in paying a little bit more to government,” he said.

"Bubu congratulates Hayaya Bail-Low on reelection, urges him to owe 48 months salaries",https://punocracy.com/bubu-congratulates-hayaya-bail-low/,2019-11-23T08:26:34+01:00,"By: Mai Kasuwa
President Mahmud Boo-Harry, fondly known asBubuamong his fans, has congratulated Hayaya Bail-Low of Kogi state on his re-election and urged him to owe the people of the state 48 months salaries.
The president whose congratulatory message was made public by his Senior Special Assistant on Hate Speech, Gabaru Shehhu, noted that Bail-Low’s election was well-deserved.
The statement reads in part: “Congratulations to Governor Hayaya Bail-Low on his re-election. It was a race well-run and a victory well won. I urge him to see his renewed mandate as another opportunity to build on the foundations already laid towards impoverishing the lives of the people of Kogi state.
“The N10 billion electoral largesse released by the Presidency few days to the election was only a bait to tranquilise the minds of the befuddled electorate; many of whom must have been counting their losses one by one now.
“Mr Governor, I urge you to develop their sufferings and glorify their poverty. That is one cornerstone of our party’s policies – domesticating poverty massively and celebrating corrupt officials, willful abuse of court orders and rape of the nation’s constitution. 38 months of unpaid salaries are just the tip of the iceberg. Owe them 48 months.”
Reacting to the message, Bail-Low who spoke while scratching his scrotum at his palatial residence, dedicated the victory to the‘god of frustration and prostration’. He disclosed that his underdevelopment policies and numerous months of unpaid salaries yielded the desired frustration among people of the state not to think straight while casting their ballots.
“Likewise, I am thankful to my colleague, Mallam Hell-Rufire, who came all the way from Kaduna to kneel before them. His prostration even though he almost did it like a millipede was heart-catching. If not for the frustration and prostration, those PDPigs would have been planning to release a new album at Lugard House.
Declaring that
“our plan has not changed to under-develop Kogi state,” he said his “resolve is
to owe the highest salaries in Nigeria in the next four years.”
Meanwhile, the hip-hop senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District has threatened to report Bail-Low and the APC to embattled US President Donald Trump.
In a 2-minutes-4-seconds video obtained by a Punocrat on his Twitter timeline,Ai-Dino who was opening his eyes widely like someone who had taken 15 wraps of Indian hemp, disclosed that “there were no elections in Kogi state last weekend.
“What we had were shenanigans and conscious rape of democratic principles; facilitated and exacerbated by unprecedented political rascality and violent bestiality. In fact, I am still in a state of shock and unwarranted stupor. Donald Trump must hear this!”

"UI rusticates Character, unveils plan to build Institute for ‘Budget Padding’ Studies",https://punocracy.com/ui-rusticates-character/,2019-11-23T08:12:46+01:00,"By: Mai Kasuwa.
The management of the University of E-bad-an has rusticated ‘character’ from the institution and unveiled plans to kick-start a new Institute for ‘Budget Padding’ and Corruption Studies.
This was disclosed
at the highlights of the closing event of the institution’s 71st convocation held
at the International Conference Centre.
According to the vice-chancellor, Prof. Edowwu Olayyinka, the Senate at its Special Sitting held on Sunday evening at Abe-Igi in Abadina resolved to rusticate ‘Character’ and henceforth award the institution’s degrees to only those worthy in ‘learning.’
He noted that, “Hitherto, the University of E-bad-an had always awarded its certificates to students found worthy in ‘character and learning’ but things have changed and the senate which comprises many professors lacking in character decided to rusticate ‘Character’ and henceforth award degrees based on learning.
“You see, all those awarded UI degrees at the various levels were solely based on learning. Even those given automatic appointments were based on academic performance. Although they may have some character… but what’s my business?”
Responding to allegations by ICPC that University of E-bad-an was one of the institutions indicted in budget padding, he confirmed that it was true that UI budget was padded under his watch.
He, however,
noted that the padding was to fund the Institute for Budgeting Padding and
Corruption Studies; the first of its kind in Nigeria.
He argued that it was high time Nigeria built a National University of Corruption (NUC); in the meantime in its absence, the institute would do. He equally said he would be willing to be the pioneeringChancellorofViceof the institution.
When asked if he thinks he could lead the institution, he interjected: Why not? “My mischievous credentials, professional qualifications in deflatinggra-graand over 30 years impertinence to due process in the academia give me an unequaled edge among my contemporaries in the corrupt world to lead the NUC,” Olayyinka said.
It would be recalled that UI, UNN, UCH, and some tertiary institutions wererecently shortlistedfor a ‘Budget Padding’ award under the aegis of the ICPC. The award ceremony is scheduled to hold on Boxing Day, 26 December 2019, at the plenary of the National Assembly.

Once upon a (great) country,https://punocracy.com/once-upon-a-great-country/,2019-11-21T07:31:34+01:00,"By: Adebayo AbdulRahman Adedayo
Once upon a time, a very long time ago, a time when youths were lazy and thieves were not corrupt,there was a country.This country was so wealthy it was named the global headquarters of poor — no, rich — people.
During this period the people were satisfied with the serene environment that nation harboured to the extent they felt at ease when it was thought that things had fallen apart. They were largely satisfied with the turn of events.
For example, during this period, the governor of one of the thirty-something states ordered the stop of a road project because the N7 billion initially earmarked for it was too much. So he went to the drawing board and held series of serious meetings with the best brains in his government. After a few seconds, minute minutes, notable hours and several months he reached a new decision and re-awarded the project for little over N9 billion — a smaller amount.
In another state, the governor reiterated that the king’s welfare is more paramount than the workers’ survival because who are the workers without their king. So he went on to buy a Rolls Royce with a few billions of Naira for the king of one village without paying salaries. Of course, the workers did not move a finger in protest since they understood the importance of a new car purchase for the king, whose old cars were unbefitting of his status in the league of powerful kings.
You remember that saying “one good turn deserves another”? That was how the people of one northern state demonstrated the importance of bribery in nation-building. They re-elected a man caught on camera receiving billions ofgan-dollarjust to inform other politicians that bribery is an essential tool for ensuring the money in the state coffers are emptied appropriately.
The peaceful terrain of this nation was a force to reckon with because no sort of financial irresponsibility or ethical immorality was accommodated to the extent that a man was arrested and detained for embezzling his own money and abusing Mr President —  yes, Mr President! — an internationally renowned medical tourist who placed a travel restriction on members of his cabinet just to ensure he retained his crown as the most travelled Nigerian political office holder for the fifth consecutive year.
The only group of small boys trying to disturb the peace of the land by killing few people once in a while were called Boko Haram and, luckily for the people of the country, it didn’t take long before the armed forcestechnically defeatedthem. Even though some people complain that these small boys still kill people once in a while and detonate small bombs at will, it didn’t matter because all the army need do is to also defeat them culturally, physically, psychologically and spiritually.
Speaking of spirituality, the country is doing so well already in this area, so victory in that regard is already a work in progress.
The level of morality in this country was so high that universities suspended small boys for being too small, and big boys for writing poor letters or having no beards.
Even though this country was so developed that it was ranked in the top 200 most developed countries in the world, the comptroller-general of its customs service claimed that the closure of the border in less than six months would make the country as great as China because all China did to become the number one economy in the world was to close its border.
All these were events and occurrences that characterised a great nation with no bad roads a very long time ago.
Thankfully, I did not witness that period because I was still unborn. If I did, I would do nothing but leave that country and travel to… nowhere …because that time is now and here I am somewhere in Nigeria writing a detailed account of the great things that happened in Nigeria a very long time ago.
Did I say a long time ago? Sorry. Actually, that time is now.

​Th​​e seven commandments of surviving in Nigerian politics,https://punocracy.com/%e2%80%8bth%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8be-seven-commandments-of-surviving-in-nigerian-politics/,2019-11-19T06:51:14+01:00,"By: Adebayo Yousuph.
As I sit to pen my thoughts on this topic, the first line that popped up in my head is an advice given to Indian American comedian Hasan Minhaj who runs a satirical commentary show on political and social issues on Netflix. The show is titled ‘Patriot Act’ and Hasan had planned to discuss Politics in India on one of the episodes of the show few weeks to the Indian election – which was tagged the biggest electoral show on earth.
His choice of topic was a point of concern for his family members including an aunt who told him ‘Politics is like ajalebi*, round, round, round, you don’t know where it ends, where it starts.’ In any case, this is not peculiar to politics in India alone. It’s applicable in the Nigerian context as well. Politics can really be hysterically dramatic, astonishingly erratic and more often than not simply fickle.
Hence, a heightened dose of smartness, wisdom and savviness is needed to successfully manoeuver through the murky waters of Nigerian politics. Just like the biblical 10 commandments in the Old Testament, here are the 7 unwritten commandments of surviving in Nigerian politics.
If you aim to be successful in the politics of Nigeria, you just can’t afford to burn bridges. They say you don’t seek cover from rain in the same household more than once. Thank God there’s an exception to every rule for, in this case, politics can drive you to join the same political party a lot of times.
We’ve seen it happen before. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was once a member of the ruling APC which he joined from the PDP after failing to secure the presidential ticket in the presidential primaries of the PDP in 2015. Now he’s back into the PDP, contested as the presidential flagbearer of the party in the 2019 general elections and with the look of things might want to give it another shot in 2023.
Thou shall not be surprised if he’s contesting under the banner of the APC by then. You literally can jump from one end of the spectrum to the other but just ensure that you do not burn bridges while at it. Politics in Nigeria is a perfect depiction of the ‘a ti lo, a ti de’ saying. You just might soon be back!
Nigerian politics has been berated more times than necessary for its lack of clear intellectual standards and political values. I mean the US has the Democrat and the Republicans. You choose which side of the divide you want to belong to. And it only happens once in a blue moon that a politician will switch from one party to the other.
In the 21st century, Arlen Specter is the only Republican to have switched into becoming a non-independent Democrat. This is because there are fundamental values and intellectual arguments that you have to subscribe to before becoming a bonafide member of any of the parties.
The closest we have to that in Nigeria is the Progressives and the not-so-pronounced Conservatives. Albeit, they even tend to confuse us as there has always been a free influx of members from one side of the divide to the other.
So an upcoming politician in Nigeria needs to understand that, that you are the spokesperson of a certain party today doesn’t mean you won’t be dining with top officials of the opposing party tomorrow. It’s nothing deep, there’s just no permanent friend or foe. I mean who could have believed that Senator Iyiola Omisore in Osun state will be the best friend of the APC in the build-up to the rerun of the Osun election.
See, poverty has eaten deep into the fabric of our nationhood. With the highest rate of extreme poverty globally, Nigerians tend to gravitate towards you regardless of who you are, your political history and your plans for their future and that of their offspring.
Even if you have juicy offers from them that will set them on a path to lifetime political dividends, just feed their stomach first. They’ll worship you. And if you need a handout on this, kindly consult Fayose.
Over time, we’ve suffered a whole lot from political office holders in this country. As much as we complain of poor governance and gross incompetence, if there’s anything the typical Nigerian politician scored an A on, it has to be the art and science of staying aloof from the people who voted them into power almost immediately after they’ve been announced as winners of the elections.
And somehow we’ve gotten used to it as a people. We don’t expect the lawmakers representing us in our stench-filled, awful and pitiable slums except for two times in 4 years. The first is when they are seeking our votes and the second is when they are preparing for the next election.
However, a politician who stays close and identifies with his people at the grassroots will forever be revered. It’s a pity there’s no landline in heaven, we could just have called Adedibu to ask how without contesting a single political office, we by virtue of his ‘Amala politics’ installed and removed governors in Oyo state at will.
In Nigerian politics, the secret of sustained relevance is to ensure that whoever succeeds you is from you. He is someone who won’t trample upon what you can refer to as your achievements as well as someone who will cover your tracks on some of the misdeeds you’ve perpetrated while in office.
Chief Olusegun Obasanjo didn’t become unarguably the most prominent politician alive in the whole of Africa for nothing. This was a man who handpicked Yar’adua as his successor and ratified Jonathan for his first term.
In fact, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has a robust body of work on how to survive the Nigerian political landscape with this strategy. He hasn’t only been installing his successors but has also been directly involved in the political careers of some other people.
Remember that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Ambode, Aregbesola, Ajimobi and even Sanwoolu are all his protégé.
Remember the good old saying, ‘a river that forgets his source will dry up’. It is still very relevant in modern-day politics in Nigeria. Much disputed but the role godfathers in Nigerian politics can’t still be thrown in with a trowel. They have the experience, connect, clout and the money to support your political career.
However, in order to forestall any case of crashing like a pack of cards with your political dreams and aspirations truncated, thou shall not forget thy godfather.
You know what? We don’t have to say more on this. Just ask Ambode. That man has a lot of tales to tell. He can attest to the mysticism and sovereignty of godfathers and the impending wrath you stand a chance of facing if you go against their dictates. Follow obediently their instructions and you’d be out of trouble while your political career flourishes.
Politics in Nigeria is so fickle and vacillating. No one can be so sure of what comes next. One minute, the masses are singing your praises and the next moment you are struggling to get them to vote for you. This might be because of a single action or inaction which you consider insignificant but turns out to be significant enough to pull you down.
So always have a backup plan. If politics does not work, what will I do? Actually, a lot of our politicians are businessmen. Even the president is a part-time cattle-rearer while we also have a lawmaker who can help us break the duopoly of Wizkid and Davido as well as win us that much-coveted Grammy.
In Oyo state, someone who is very close to becoming the governor of Central Bank of Nigeria resigned to contest the governorship seat and he lost and now he’s back to tendering to his lots of businesses including a couple of investments in the nightlife industry.
One person I’m itching to have a sit down with his Honorable Lam Adedapo Adesina who had a dramatic row with ex-Governor Abiola Ajimobi and both eventually lost their reelection bid. I’d really love to know what the plan is for him towards 2023. You can’t just afford not to have a side hustle. I mean where’s the money for the next campaign going to come from.If you faithfully obey these seven commandments, I’m sure you’ll be around for a long time in the Nigerian political scene.

Kogi elections: Was democracy raped?,https://punocracy.com/kogi-elections-was-democracy-raped/,2019-11-18T05:11:27+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
A round of applause for INEC, security operatives, and Kogites. They all worked together to ensure we had one of the most peaceful, non-violent, free and fair elections in any state in Nigeria. What more could we describe as peaceful when the electorate cast their votes with ultimate reverence instilled by guns, thugs, and bullets? Whoborn younot to coordinate yourself under duress?
Our electoral reform must be tougher than rocket science. Election results no longer reflect the will of the people, except the will of the oppressors and dictators who seek to impose themselves on the people like a rapist on a voluptuous damsel. Actually, they are all rapists. Or what do we call them? Maybe “accidental public servants” is the right word. They politically rape the people, plunder on their resources and cart away valuables when their 8 years is complete.
Because the Presidency holds the lives of the citizens in high esteem, they have to, first of all, congratulate whoever wins in Kogi, applaud INEC for a job well done and shower encomium on security operatives before they — if they will — count the number of lost lives, rough-handled citizens, injured voters, and traumatised individuals. Meanwhile, it is an offence to mentally or physically endanger any kind of animal in the UK. Is an animal in the UK now worth more than a Nigerian? Well, your heart can only be where your treasure is. If they had invested so much in the citizens, they’ll place so much value on them. Every Nigerian is only valuable every election year.
The handwriting is already on the wall. We must prepare for the 2023 elections else we will see anotherKogi elections— but on a broader scale.
The next level broom seeks to sweep everywhere including where it clearly isn’t popular. This has been the trademark of every election that has taken place under their watch. Maybe peace means another thing in their dictionary. Peace is enforcing the broom on people. Peace is deploying federal power to forcefully win elections. Peace is using peaceful thugs to romance ballot boxes when the tides aren’t in their favour. It’s looking very much like the relationship they have with nonviolent elections has long ended.
We have told bootlickers on their sides, but they still argue with us despite the fact that their lord and personal saviour is owing them nine months salary and they cannot afford a good education for their children. They still remain loyal.
In the midst of all these, my thoughts are with Kogites. Kogites whose opportunity to get down from the bus ofyahaya, sorry,yeyegovernance into another of their dream might have been sabotaged. Well, Kogites should have forgiven him. Or didn’t he apologise and even rented beggars from Abuja and Kaduna to join him?E fi sile, omode lo nsee, they said. No controversy, they really enjoyed the broom these past years. It has thoroughly swept all that true accountability, democracy, and governance should bring. No matter their intentions, struggles and desires; the broom was there to wipe it off. I wish Kogites get what they truly desire."
"Democracy files for divorce. ‘I’m leaving Nigeria for Dubai,’ she says.",https://punocracy.com/democracy-files-for-divorce-im-leaving-nigeria-for-dubai-she-says/,2019-11-18T04:45:11+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Ms Democracy, granddaughter of Ancient Greece and darling of the modern world, has officially filed for divorce against her estranged husband, Nigeria, a former servant of Great Britain and one-time poster boy of African excellence.
Her petition for dissolution was filed on Monday morning at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory. In the 700-pages-long document, a copy of which was obtained exclusively by The T.A. Report, Ms Democracy gave various grounds for divorce, top of which is that Nigeria has been cheating on her with Ms Dictatorship, a notoriousdominatrix.
“He doesn’t consider me attractive anymore,” she lamented in an attached affidavit. “Especially, ever since he appointed that old man from Dowra as his company’s chief executive officer.”
Democracy said she can no longer tolerate Nigeria’s abusive behaviour. Almost consistently, he hits her with the rattan cane of electoral malpractice, the bullwhip of press censorship, as well as the leather belts of indiscriminate arrests and illegal detentions. According to her, the injuries she sustained from the gubernatorial elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states, where both electoral materials and electoral officials went missing, nearly killed her.
She said Nigeria, who does not believe there’s anything like marital rape, also forces himself on her, she and fears he has infected her with multiple diseases contracted from his extramarital escapades.
“Also, he is not contented with the food I give him any more,” she complained. “He has this strong desire to instead steal directly from the pot. I even learnt he keeps a secret food store at his friend’s place at the suburbs.”
She said she is considering moving in with Dubai or Canada — “if he doesn’t mind taking a second wife”.
“Anywhere but here,” she added, tears building up on the borders of her eyes. “It is clear I’m no longer wanted.”
If her petition wins in court, Democracy will walk away with 50 per cent of Nigeria’s wealth, officially. Unofficially, experts predict, the losses could be even more devastating, considering that more developed countries, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and donor organisations will be more reluctant to give “badly needed” loans and grants to the struggling son of Africa.
But Mahmud Bubu, Nigeria’s CEO who once described himself as aconverted democrat, has said he doesn’t give a hoot if Democracy packs her bags.
“The ‘converted democrat’ speech was necessary because I was unemployed at the time and needed the job offer from her husband,” he told our correspondent.
“Right now, I really don’t care and in fact hope the court grants her application. Nigeria will remarry. I understand that Madame Dictatorship is still single and searching,” he said with a smirk.
“Our borders remain closed,” he added as a note of warning to the petitioner. “So if she goes, she had better make sure she stays abroad because I have instructed our Immigration officers not to allow any foreign products inside the premises.”

We rice by closing borders,https://punocracy.com/we-rice-by-closing-borders/,2019-11-15T12:12:04+01:00,"By: Chuks .Chinyere(jj)
I hear people talking about how rash a decision it is to outrightly close the Nigerian-Benin border in a bid to help the locally produced rice sell.
“The government should have increased the import duty on foreign rice to inflate the price in the consumer market, subsidise the price of the locally produced rice so as to make it very attractive for Nigerians to buy, that way…”
I’m sorry sir but I disagree with you. Not that I believe your opinions to be wrong o, it’s just that I’m a Buharist and I’m obligated to think any criticism, constructive or otherwise, of any of the Buhari Administration’s policy, is erroneous and to be blatantly disagreed with. If you knew so much, better than the President and members of his economic team, why are you not the President yourself? With all the sense you have, you’re arguing at a newspaper stand.
“We rise by lifting others” is a working policy for the patient dog that’s always waiting to crack bones after “sharp dawgs” who you call criminally impatient and over-ambitious are making fast money and riding fast cars.
Off-topic, if you’re considering making this fast money, like Mompha and Co, try local, it pays way faster, there might be grave consequences but don’tborder, if the price of onedericaof local rice with sticks and stones can compete with the dollar exchange rate, there’s nothing God cannot do.
I understand that a bag of local rice which used to sell at N9,000 naira is gallivanting around N20,000 per bag now, while the foreign rice is priced closer to N30,000 naira per bag … way more than it ever was. Look on the bright side though: at least local rice tastes better thanoyinborice, and it’s more nutritious. If you cook it with firewood, make sure you blow the fire with you moutho. You will enjoy the rice very well. You just have to overlook the occasional coal tar your teeth will encounter every now and then. Be happy you’re buying Nigerian and helping Nigeria grow.
There might be too much sand in the local rice, but how does the average Nigerian youth who is lazy learn the importance of hard work if we keep feeding them with the type of rice they get to wash once and cook, without hassles? Can you believe there are brands of foreign rice you can cook right away without even washing first? God forbid that our government of ostentatiously high integrity continues to indulge that kind of laxity. This is why they have given us this local rice which we will have to wash several times before cooking.
Yes, no matter how many times you wash the rice there’ll still be some sand and stones,e get why: We have to learn that, no matter how much hard work you put into anything, there is still work yet to be done. Perfection is a continuous process.
You think President Buhari does not have sense? Baba knows what he’s doing.
We have to be grateful for what we have and be patient for when the big blessings will reach our hands because thislife nah turn by turn.Se bibefore the closed border, the foreign rice importers were the ones cashing out and making big money and buying big cars? Today, some friends of the government on hearing that they will soon close the border, went to colonise the production and distribution of local rice. They didn’t bother to invest in the process to make the product competitive as that’d be a waste of time and resources.
Trying to make a product good enough so that it can sell itself is for a target market that’s got a choice. When you rest assured that your family members in position are working to criminalise any possible competitive option over your product, is your own not to just start singing, “All things are working for my good; it’s intentional!”?
See eh, to make it in this country, just know the right people because it’s not by he that hustled or he that worked hard, it’s by the government that “closeth borders”."

Report)― Celebrity politician of the “body bag” fame and governor of Kadoona State, Nastir El-Rufus, on Thursday knelt before people of Kongi State, days to the gubernatorial election, alongside Nigeria’s first lady Ayiii Buhari.
His colleague, Hayaya Bail-Low, also a member of the ruling party APC is seeking reelection into the state’s top political office, and El-Rufus said he’s sure folks from Kogi are “aren’t that smart” to see through his melodrama.
Narrating the widely reported incident to a group of fellow politicians later in the day, the Kadoona godfather, one of the friends told us, expressed great confidence in the powers of his knee caps.
“When they touch the ground, it is like when an oxydising agent touches a reducing agent. The combination is deadly,” he chuckled.
“If I can kneel to God and he answers without delay, the Kongi people have no choicemana. They will not forget that moment many years to come.”
The combination of a few thousand nairas, some derica of local rice, and El-Rufus’s touching apology for his blood-sucking political ally, a new poll revealed, has significantly swayed the electorate in favour of Bail-Low.
“There’s no going back now. I’m going to vote for Hayaya Bail-Low,” one middle-aged voter said after the APC mega-rally. “Obviously, he likes the people and was learning the ropes with the first term. The second term will be differentin shaa Allah. That is what the Kadoona governor said.”

"You-High authorities endorse SU presidential candidate, VC explains why",https://punocracy.com/you-high-authorities-endorse-su-presidential-candidate-vc-explains-why/,2019-11-14T08:27:12+01:00,"Rumour has it that the You-High management, in a closed-door meeting, has agreed to support one of the Students’ Union presidential candidates. In the fact-checking process, the press had an interview with the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ebel Eduwu, on the veracity of the claims.
“Well, that’s true, and it is no rumour,” he replied matter-of-factly.
“At the sin-ate meeting yesterday, we all agreed to support one of the presidential candidates which I am sure you know.
“This was done to prevent any form of kangaroo leaders especially those beardless boys who plan to make the last years of my tenure a very difficult one.”
When he was asked whether he considered this move democratic, he said there is nothing like democracy in Nigeria and that the best leaders are appointed by society’sjagabansrather than elected.
“You see everywhere leaders are appointed, not elected so they can be titular. Take Nigeria as an example, President Boo-Hary is appointed by his uncle, that’s just democracy—if you will call it so.”
Professor Edewu, aconverted democrat, further asserted that the SU presidential candidate was chosenbecause he is in Lawand also has fulfilled the electoral requirements. He, however, disclosed some confidential information as to why the Law candidate was picked, while begging the Press not to reveal it to the public.
“This candidate was endorsed because he won’t wage war against me,” he said. “He won’t ask where the money collected from all students as SUG fees is even when there was a proscription of the Union for two years.
“He won’t ask why the students still pay for ID cards when they are given a single ID card that lasts till they graduate. He won’t ask any funny questions that will bring the EFFC to come to probe me.”
The Press further asked him where all these monies went too. Prevaricating, the VC peeped through the window to check if anyone was listening and even requested all reporters to switch off their recording devices.
“The truth is,” he began, “I just want the students to pay these monies as a way of contributing financially to the university’s progress. You may call it students’ charity.
“It is through these funds I have been able to renovate the university, through for instance painting some old structures, and this is why in return I give the students the right to express their displeasure in my administration.”
While addressing the issue of damaging of banners by candidates and other unscrupulous forms of politicking, the VC described the acts as normal. He posited that at least they have not done a quarter of what thebeardless boydid, which almost got him out of his job.
“I see nothing bad in damaging banners so far it’s not the school’s properties,” he said. “The aspirants should feel free to do what they like, but what they don’t know is that the results of the elections are ready. So they would only be foolish to keep antagonising themselves. Our preferred candidate for President is from Law.”
Meanwhile, Kenide Baraka, one of the presidential candidates has lamented the favouritism in the university authorities’ decision. “This is sheer hypocrisy and in fact barbaric,” he said. “I cannot believe that the university authorities can stoop so low to endorse aspirants at the SU level. This is not a post for Vice-chancellors … but before we say anything, they will ask us to grow beards.”

Nigerians and the so-called African time,https://punocracy.com/nigerians-and-the-so-called-african-time/,2019-11-13T06:55:33+01:00,"A short piece on Nigerians’ consciousness to the time factor.
The major tenet of African time is,“You don’t do things at the right time, else you appear too subservient to time.”
Someone said that the maxim“time is value”is of great importance to a Nigerian. This is very true as all actions, reactions, and inactions of Nigerians revolve around time consciousness. Nigerians’ great respect for time is shown in their creation of another form of time that best suits their demands, known as the“African time.”So when a Nigerian fixes time for some important event, don’t be surprised when the event starts at the allocated time, the next day. That’s among the wonders of African Time.
Scholarly attempts to define African time have proved abortive as it’s become difficult to pinpoint it to a single definition. Some people opine that African Time would bring the similitude of European time-consciousness to Nigerians, others say that it would give our leaders a sense of belonging when they reference certain completion of projects to a particular time.
If you are going to attend a Nigerian’s wedding ceremony and the invitation card says the programme would start at 10 am. You will be doing yourself a great deal of disservice if you get to the event centre a few minutes before the scheduled time as an early bird. Of course, the wedding ceremony would have begun but you would be the MC, DJ, and attendee all rolled into one to kick-start the ceremony.
Nigerians’ continuous (dis)regard for time is shown in whatever activities they engage in. If you invite a Nigerian to dinner at 8 pm, you must not be too hungry to eat the food because the Nigerian wouldn’t show up quite soon. So expect him around 10 pm or 11 pm; and please when he comes, do not thank him for coming too early. Else you would have no choice but to listen to his eulogy of time.
The African time though not widely known is what made people all over the world know the characteristics of a Nigerian. They keep adding more hours to the scheduled time in relation to events and that’s what makes them distinct. But never confuse this time phenomenon with procrastination, they can never be the same.
Even school students nowadays show fervid love for African time. A school would resume by 8 am and you would see some students sauntering around the school gate around 10 am. You then wonder if it is still the same school they are attending.
A friend of mine was telling me a story the other day. He said a Nigerian was invited to a programme by his European friend abroad. And, as the tradition goes, he got there three hours after the scheduled time and was surprised that the event had long ended. Of course, he was right to have used African Time … but was wrong to have used it in another man’s country.
There are many contributions by people of wits who have given explanations on how African Time operates so an innocent person would not be caught unawares. Many deliberations brought about some guidelines that best describe the operation of the African time.
If you’re invited to an event and you hear the MC saying the following, rest assured African time is in operation:
1. We are sorting out some logistics.
2. Give a round of applause to the organisers of this event.
3. Our guests of honour will be with us in a few moments.
4. Before we commence the programme, you can do a brief introduction among yourselves
Many people have, however, expressed their displeasure over the negative effects of African time. They say it is a disregard forFather Timeand would tarnish the nation’s image globally. But that’s just mere talk. It is not a valid argument. Isn’t it amazing that a student may come to an examination and find his friends discussing answers to the questions and predicting questions in the next paper? Moreover, if you are invited to a food feast by your neighbour, you need not be too punctual, lest you create the impression that you are hungry and only your neighbour’s meal can suffice you.
The African time factor is very applicable to the project implementation of the Nigerian government as well. If the Minister of Transportation says,“We will complete the Lagos-Ibadan expressway in two years’ time.”Of course, the citizens would jubilate, but they know full well that that project would be commissioned in five, six, seven years … or, in fact, may never be completed. No need to fret. It is just African Time in action!"
"UI VC sets SU electoral rules, warns against allowing beardless contestants for presidency",https://punocracy.com/ui-vc-sets-su-electoral-rules/,2019-11-12T07:04:45+01:00,"By: Mai Kasuwa
The University of Ibadan Vice-Chancellor, Professor Abel Idowu Olayinka, has single-handedly set the electoral rules for the upcoming students’ union election in the institution.
The VC who unveiled the rules under a tree close to his lodge warned all the electoral commissioners against allowing any beardless student to contest for the presidency of the students’ union.
Olayinka while charging the commissioners to be dedicated in their duties stated, “I should like to say that only students in their penultimate year can contest for the post of president. Particularly, I for one will never allow some beardless students to contest as president or disrupt the relative peace we have been enjoying on campus over the past 2 years.
“As part of your duties, you must diligently scrutinise all candidates and ensure that only those whose beards are naturally grown contest for president. This is a non-negotiable criterion. Any contestant with artificial beards must be screened out outright and his name forwarded to the Student Disciplinary Committee (SDC) for betrayal of nature and impersonation.”
The official release by the VC which was exclusively obtained by a Punocrat reads in part: “All contestants must be on second class upper division. Any student who has attended the SDC in the past, either in person or by proxy, is not eligible to contest. Any student affiliated to one nuisance called Kay Bello is not eligible to contest.”
The decision has caused panic among students especially aspirants whose cumulative grade points average (CGPAs) are only visible through the lens of a microscope.
According to one beardless Oluwo Majekodunmi, an aspirant for the post of president, “I think the VC is just being mean with these rules. I don’t have beards but I have sense. I pray he changes his mind because I have been nursing the ambition to become UISU president since I was a toddler. I don’t know what he wants us to do to change his mind but I am ready to do anything. I don’t mind sweeping and mopping the whole of the Tekana Tamuno building for 1 month or more. He should just change his mind, abeg.”
Meanwhile, one of the commissioners, Abetiofe, who spoke to Punocracy recalled how the VC was sweating while reeling out the said rules. “The VC was unusually sweating like someone who just came out from the oven in UI bakery. His countenance looked like that of a military dictator whose territory has come under attack. I don’t want to compare him with Abacha, but they seemed to have had dinner the previous night,” he disclosed.
Recall that UISU had been suspended on 30 May 2017, after a beardless 200-level student led a peaceful protest to demand issuance of ID cards whose money had been collected for two consecutive sessions without production.
According to unofficial sources, the money generated from the ID cards fees was over N60 million. But delay in the production was caused partly because of clash of interests in the bursary unit and the directorate of ITeMS; as both wanted aggrandised benefits from the contract of the ID cards production.
While the SU was
banned, the SU building was shut down and many of its officials were rusticated
for various semesters. In fact, termites and other celestial creatures have
become officials and dwellers of the offices.
The ban on the union was recently lifted after its first president, T Cool, got married to hisOtepuin Augus.

The event was held on Saturday at the University of Ibadan.
The grouphad earlier announcedthe winners of the prize which was judged byJames Yékú, a PhD in English and Assistant Professor at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, USA; andOladeinde Olawoyin, an award-winning investigative journalist at Premium Times newspaper and author of the weekly column, Saturday Satire.
The winners of the inaugural prize are Jesuferanmi Igbinigie, who won the grand prize, Winlade Israel, and Funmilayo Obasa.
Saturday’s ceremony had in attendance Tijani Oluwamayowa, an award-winning Fact-checker with AFP and Development Editor for TheCable Newspaper; Dr. Yinka Egbokhare, author of Dazzling Mirage; and Olawoyin.
While delivering the welcome address on behalf of the organising team, ‘Kunle Adebajo emphasised the need for satire in the contemporary Nigerian society and the world at large.
He also announced the World Day of Satire as a way of recognising the importance and use of satire as a helpful tool in driving change in the society, correcting ills, and reducing political apathy.
“Why did we choose November 9?” he asked.
“We could easily tell you that according to history books, November 9, 1989, was when East Germany denounced the Berlin Wall after which German citizens tore it down, and how we want the day to fit into this narrative of freedom and absence of censorship. Or we could tell you that November 9 (11/9) is actually an inversion of 9/11 and tie this to how there are always alternative, civilised ways of venting grievances … But the truth is it is just a convenient date for us.
“And one thing I’ve come to realise is we don’t need permission from history to make history,” the investigative journalist said as he formally declares the World Day of Satire.
While speaking at the event, Tijani engaged the attendees on how humour or laughter can be used to trigger nationwide development and also cautioned satirists to be wary of the thin line that exists between humorous write-ups and fake news.
“Political humorous writing has the capacity to reach a larger number of people,” he noted because humour is a universal language. “Political cartooning has the capacity to reach more people. You can get more people talking about a topic using it. And it is prophetic in nature.”
Dr. Egbokhare spoke about how satire can be used as a tool for steering societal change. She broke down the three types of satire, Horatian, Juvenalian, and Menippean, and their various merits.
According to her, the satirist must amplify the voices of the less privileged and provoke those at the helm of affairs in order to inspire change.
The satirist must “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,” she emphasised. Otherwise, “you are not a satirist,” she added.
She, however, advised that writers of satires must be careful in what and how they write so as not to endanger themselves as well as put the society in a state of chaos due to existing ethnoreligious sentiments.
Satirists must “be culturally intelligent …because you don’t want to start a fire that you cannot control,” she said as she concluded her speech."
An introduction to Fundamental Human Rights: the Nigerian sub-species,https://punocracy.com/introduction-to-rights/,2019-11-08T08:25:39+01:00,"Just like any other progressive government in today’s world, the Nigerian government holds the subject of “human rights” to be of paramount importance. Fundamental human rights are so important they have a separate chapter dedicated to them in the constitution. But, also like many other (like-minded) nations, the country doesn’t rely solely on what the constitution provides. Sometimes, if not (in fact) most times, it takes a more rational approach, slightly different from what the law says.
Some may call it the “Ruin of Law” approach, but policy-makers prefer to refer to it as the “Rule of Lorr” method, borne out of a sincerelorrof the people and power (not necessarily in that order).
In view of this, political scientists have come up with a more realistic list of fundamental human rights as are applicable in Nigeria (especially for the benefit of people like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who pay visits from time to time). Not to waste time, here’s a summation of the findings.
1. Every person shall have a right to life, afforded by quality health facilities and standard of living, and no one shall be deprived intentionally of his life provided they are rich according to international best practices.
2. Every citizen is entitled to move freely throughout Nigeria as long as their destinations do not include terrorist enclaves and the statehouse.
2 (a) This right shall be exercised without prejudice to the right of cattle and their directors to the same entitlement.

"Ganduje monopolises corruption in Kano, brags of PhD in Pocketing Dollars",https://punocracy.com/ganduje-monopolises-corruption-in-kano-brags-of-phd-in-pocketing-dollars/,2019-11-08T07:24:29+01:00,"By: Mai Kasuwa
Kano state governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has monopolised corruption in the state and bragged that his PhD thesis was on ‘Pocketing Dollars’.
Ganduje declared
his monopoly of corruption while swearing in the 20 newly appointed
commissioners at the Sani Abacha stadium.
The governor who charged the commissioners to be dedicated to impunity and stomach infrastructures in a bid to reach the next level warned that anyone who competes with him in corrupt practices will be shown the way out of office.
“I want to use
this opportunity to congratulate you on the new appointment but you are
required to measure up to expectation and do all you can to move Kano state to
the next level.
“Let me state
clearly without any equivocation that anyone of you who engages in corrupt
practices will be thrown out of office. There can’t be two kings in a kingdom.
I have made frantic efforts to reach the zenith in corrupt and shady dealings;
particularly, in pocketing dollars. Therefore, I urge you all to accord me the
exclusive right as the Sarkin Dollars of Nigeria,” he said.
Noting that he would have been an academic at a National University of Corruption, Ganduje said his political calling made many people oblivious that he has a PhD in ‘Pocketing Dollars and Glorified Corruption’ from Nigeria’s first university.
“I laugh when people were criticising me for pocketing bundles of dollars in mybaban riga. If you were a doctor at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital or University College Hospital, Ibadan, won’t you move around in stethoscope? How else do they want me to show my expertise in a realm I got my doctorate degree?” he queried.
“If any of you must engage in corrupt practices to accelerate our long walk to the next level, then receive your cash in naira. Anyone caught taking foreign currency other than I will face the wrath of the law.”
Responding to Ganduje’s
speech, the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Mr. Murtala Sule-Garu thanked
the governor for the collective opportunity given to them to continue with
their democratic robbery of state resources.
“Your
Excellency, sir, we are in this together. We are thankful for the ‘Come and
Chop Appointment’. Rest assured of our total loyalty to your government and our
strong resolve to ensure your kickbacks come in manifolds. In fact, we die
here!” he concluded."
"Fake news, fake legislators, fake government",https://punocracy.com/fake-news-fake-legislators-fake-government/,2019-11-07T08:07:10+01:00,"By: Olamide Francis
Nigerians have entered ‘one chance’. The bill to curb fake news propagated on social media has passed its first hearing at the iron stamp senate. Oh, don’t let the big grammar — Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill, 2019 — deceive you. Fake news is fake news.
Only people like us who don’t mean well for Nigeria and are not analytical enough will think fake news isn’t top of Nigeria’s problem. Let me describe it using the words of Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, the sponsor of the bill: “In a developing nation facing so many challenges, there is no better time regulate the Internet.” Ladies and Gents, because of the many challenges we’re facing, now is the time to fight the spread of fake news.
Fake news on social media is an idiot. It is responsible for the hunger in the land, the slow growth rate of our economy, the increase in impoverished people, the poor power sector, the constant diminishing of our educational standards, and the mammoth crowd of Nigerians seeking to run out of the country. We’ve even closed our borders to avoid entrance of foreign fake news.
In fact, if we check properly, fake news is the reason why it has taken so long to complete Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Therefore, according to the right-thinking senator, it has to come first on the list of menaces to do away with. And, it must be implemented as fast as the minimum wage we’ve been dragging since last year.
Our distinguished Senator, inside his properly air-conditioned office, even gave examples of nations where the fake news bill has been fully grafted into their law. You know it’s an abomination to compare Nigeria and saner climes when we intend describing unemployment rate, quality of education, wages and salaries, technology, power, economy, and transportation. But, when it’s time tomuguliseor swindle the populace, they are quick to get a reference from abroad.
If we say the fake news on social media they’re seeking to curb with the bill are articles that point out the flaws in the current administration, publications that don’t dance to the tune of their ruling party and writings that expose the decadence in the system, their bootlickers will call us names.
Even without this bill, we see how gentle and warming journalists and generic news writers are being treated. The way they go in and out of courtrooms to greet their lawyer-friends is honourable. Some of them even mysteriously disappear for holidays proudly sponsored by the government. No doubt this bill is from a pure conscience with good intent. This doesn’t look like an attempt to rob Nigerians of their freedom of speech and expression.
In the language of well-meaning Nigerians: Rome wasn’t built in a day. It seems though that this Rome is taking forever to be built. Maybe the building materials are imported from Jupiter."

The Koton Karfe custodial centre in Kogi has collapsed under heavy flooding, leading to the escape of 228 inmates. The Comptroller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, Jafar Ahmed, who confirmed this while speaking with journalists in Koton Kafe on Monday said that the flood came at about 3 a.m., submerging the perimeter fence and the walls of two cells.  He said that there were 228 inmates at the centre as at the time of the incident. Mr Ahmed said that the prison was not habitable at present, saying that the re-arrested inmates were being transferred to other prison facilities in the state. He said that details of the incident will be made public later.
Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State on Friday signed an agreement with 30 Saudi-based clerics who are residing in the city of Makka, the seat of Islam’s holiest mosque, to endlessly pray for the return of peace in Borno, a government statement said. The governor, who has been in Saudi Arabia since last week, had the agreement sealed with the 30 clerics whose responsibility, henceforth is to offer prayers and perform daily tawaf (circulation) around the holy Kaaba. Muslims believe that prayers offered in the holy mosque of Kaaba are speedily granted.
“The Federal Ministry of Education is embarrassed with the allegations of sexual harassment in Nigerian higher institutions. Girls should read their books and be able to defend their certificates. They (female students) should stop going to lecturers unnecessarily and should not harass their lecturers. We are recommending UNIPORT’s Sexual Harassment Policy to other higher institutions in Nigeria,” Adamu advised.
Q: How prepared is the fire service against the growing threats posed by frequent fuel tanker accidents?
A: The Service is well prepared. Like the Controller General of Fire CGF, Liman Ibrahim Alhaji said during his maiden briefing some weeks ago, before the advent of this administration, most of the few trucks we had were largely unserviceable and we most times had to employ the services of prayer warriors to help us pray for the trucks not to break down when going for operations. However, President Muhammadu Buhari has graciously approved the purchase of 93 fire fighting trucks for the Service. This is in addition to the various trucks and other vehicles that we had taken delivery of in the past four years and which have been commissioned and deployed for operations.

Kampala Archbishop Cyprian Kizito Lwanga has fronted a controversial proposal that seeks to have the central government deduct 10% from people’s monthly salary and forwarded to the church. Speaking at Saint Mary’s Cathedral Rubaga during mass, the Catholic Archbishop said many Christians don’t tithe and this affects projects by the church. “Whenever we ask for tithe, everyone gives only what they have at that time. But the Bible says a tenth of whatever you earn belongs to the church,” said Archbishop Lwanga."

Satire ≠ Fake News,https://punocracy.com/satire-%e2%89%a0-fake-news/,2019-11-01T08:23:25+01:00,"Originally published: 3 Oct 2017 By:Anoushka RavalonThe Intelligence Brief.

Strong democracy requires robust discourse and debate. However, debate need not be serious at every turn. In fact, democratic progress relies upon a daily influx of satire and free speech to question and challenge those in power. Nonetheless, under President Trump, the term ‘fake news’ has been embedded in worldwide vernacular. Mr Trump repeatedlydenouncedU.S. mainstream media services, including established networks like CNN, andlashed outat satirical shows such as Saturday Night Live for portraying him negatively.
The vilification of satirical news media influences the perception of well-recognized media platforms. Across the political spectrum,65%of Americans believe the media publishes false news stories. Thus, by promoting a rejective view on satire and mainstream media, Mr Trump’s ‘fake news’ phenomenon increases suspicion and social unrest.
As ‘post-truth’ was the Oxford Dictionary’sWord of the Yearfor 2016, the increasing importance of accuracy and reliability of information sources requires politically challenging comedy, cartoons, and television — the very mediums the fake news debacle seeks to devalue.
Satire is accessible, informative, and serves the majority of millennials as a primary news source, whether in the form of memes, video commentaries or online articles. If this source is renounced as fake and unreliable, it may leave a generation disillusioned and apathetic towards knowledge of world news.
For example, ‘The Colbert Report’is an established news source, especially for the 18–29 age category. It utilizes satire to provide a witty and digestible source of local and international current affairs. Humor is a factor that canshapemillennial votes. If millennials do not continue to, or are prevented from engaging with satire and comedy, it will likely signal that this generation are distancing themselves from politics.
Satire matters because it subverts and questions people in authority. Comedy and satire provide a social check on the government. It encourages observers to challenge and question policy. Conflating the proclaimed post-truth era with mainstream news outlets and satire runs the risk of depriving journalism of perspective.
It is imperative to understand the difference between fake news and satire. Millennials can read a range of sources, likeThe Onion, that presents accessible information in a satirical and accurate way. Watching shows such asThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah,Mock the Week, orMaz Jobrani’scomedy sketches is a simple way to develop judgement through humor when reading global news articles and opinion pieces.
Millennials are encouraged to support the industry of political satirical comedy. Not only will this help promote an undervalued voice in politics, but it will provide respite from the realities of the current global political situation. Millennials can show their appreciation of comedians and satirists by supporting theReporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Stand by those providing the world with access to political debate.
If millennials can learn to question legitimacy and truth in the content they read by challenging biases, evidence, and opinions, the next generation of writers, satirists, and politicians will develop a mechanism to see through empty political rhetoric and the infamous fake news.

For that, you needthe Village People’s Dictionary(VP’s Dictionary for short). This is because Nigeria is a unique country where English words hardly sustain the meaning intended for them by the English people.
Collins Dictionary, for instance,defines a roadas “a long piece of hard ground which is built between two places so that people can drive or ride easily from one place to the other”. That’s correct you know—but only as long as you don’t import that understanding to Nigeria. Things are much different here… So different we’d need the entire dictionary rewritten to suit our realities. In Nigeria, a road would be more appropriately defined as “a warzone where potholes are mines, shock absorbers are shields, curses are bullets—and from which every soldier returns home a casualty”.
With this compilation, rest assured you can navigate through life in the giant of Africa without feeling dizzy, confused, or scammed.
1.Activist: (n)He who specializes in detecting bad-tasting food and delights in announcing his discovery, but himself has little or no knowledge of cooking.
2.Constituted authority: (n)An autocratic ruler whose rise to power is accidentally as a result of democratic processes, and often displays symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissism.
3.Corruption: (n)A crime of stealing from the state but which the state, generous as it is, punishes far less than the crime of stealing from ordinary people. Someone who steals from the state may, for instance, be asked to return some of his loot and spend a year in luxurious isolation, while he who steals from citizens is deemed undeserving of additional breaths.
4.Culture: (n)A set of actions and beliefs that people do or accept because they’ve always done them or accepted them and which, under no circumstances, are allowed to change (especially when they favour the old and the morally conservative).
5.Depression: (n)A mental health problem that is common to white men and which only they are susceptible to. Apparently, any Nigerian who suffers from depression is either faking it or isn’t a pure breed.
6.Election: (n)The process of freely choosing the next political leader from a large pool of two or three political parties, depending on such factors as zoning formula as well as the wealth and generosity of the candidates. Often used in the same sentences as malpractice, violence, and rigging.
7.God: (n)A supreme deity who must be thanked whenever the government does not succeed in destroying the people (for instance when a person survives a road accident) and who must be prayed to in order to prevent this from happening. He is also responsible for uniting the country, which, despite all odds, is a good thing.
8.Human rights: (n)A set of fundamental things every citizen is entitled to according to presidential speeches but not according to executive orders.
9.Investigative journalism: (n)See: Espionage, Treason.
10.Journalism: (n)The art of reporting what someone has said exactly how they have said it. Often, experts in this art spend four years at a tertiary institution to master it, enrolling under programmes known as Mass Communication. See: Public Relations, Amanuensis.
11.Judge: (n)A person who confidently gives orders in the open courtroom but prays secretly in his chambers for them to be executed (especially in cases involving the State Security Service).
12.Law: (n)A set of rules that, like the blind dog, are originally made to guide the actions of the people but are, in fact, the blind man dependent on the people for guidance on where to go and where not to go—where to look and where not to look.
13.Lawmaker: (n)One whose birthright it is to buy new bulletproof cars every year and is paid the salary of 50 for doing the work of zero. He’s also entitled to huge allowances and unlawful kickbacks for his labour of love to the country.
14.National Assembly: (n)A set of two retirement chambers for past governors and veteran politicians, constituting the Senate and House of Representatives.
15.Permanent Voters’ Card: (n)An identification card often used by eligible voters to open bank accounts and submit various applications—but hardly deployed in actually casting votes.
16.Political party: (n)An organisation to which people pay huge sums of money in return for high-paying public offices, political appointments, or simply more money. A political party and a wedding party have one thing in common: people don’t give a shit about the morality of the persons or union as long as food is in abundance.
17.Politician: (n)Someone who promises heaven on earth but has never been to heaven—and often doesn’t plan to either.
18.President: (n)A person who is blamed for everything that goes wrong in the country but never thinks it necessary to blame himself. “The Situation” is his beautiful second wife and he is always on top of it. When he gets tired (and he usually does) after eight years, he files for a divorce.
19.Presidential Villa: (n)A mansion at the capital city where old politicians go to retire, intelligent politicians go to become dull, and female politicians simply go to visit the other politicians.
20.Prison: (n)A place where the poor go to suffer, the guilty go to get tougher, the rich go for vacation, and the influential never go.
21.SARS: (n)Acronym for Special Advanced Robbery Squad. Also the major Internally Generated Revenue department of the Nigeria Police.

23.Supreme court: (n)The apex judicial organ in the country, sometimes technically a department under the Ministry of Justice.

The parable of the pothole,https://punocracy.com/the-parable-of-the-pothole/,2019-10-25T08:39:47+01:00,"By: Francis Olamide
Seeing is believing. After many years of wondering about the benefits of ethnic bigotry and the they-are-my-kinsmen mentality among Nigerians; I experienced firsthand why it is good to take sides with our ethnic group when matters of national importance arise. I now know, that no matter what, the interest of my kinsman must come first in conversations involving national issues. Even if he (my kinsman) is guilty of a crime punishable by death, I’ll stand by him. That’s the spirit of brotherhood, isn’t it? We should praise and defend the thief because he’s our kinsman.
Let me tell you what I saw.
I boarded a public bus somewhere in Nigeria. Youkukuknow that this our nation flows with milk, honey, sugar, and good roads. I mean, motorable roads that elongate your sojourn. Roads with so good a condition that the elite prefer to fly over it in their jets and helicopters. I don’t even know why they do that, maybe to have a better view of the terrain. You know, it’s beautiful when you’re looking from up there. They’re so sure of the work they did on the roads that they do all within their capacity to totally avoid passing through them. Let me not digress, I better stay with my story like Buhari stays in Nigeria.
While I was in that public bus, we encountered a pothole, way larger than the gap between Bubu’s front teeth. Then, something surprising happened.
As the driver approached it, the pothole cried out with a loud voice, “Who are you, driver?” Our driver responded as fast as the economic growth rate of Nigeria with, “I am Muhammed from Bornu state.” To my amazement, the pothole closed up leaving us with a smooth road to drive through. I asked the driver what just happened, he said, “Walahi, it’s because I’m from Bornu. What affects other Nigerians doesn’t affect us. Some basic problems other people encounter don’t come near us.”
Interestingly, this is the mentality of many Nigerians. They reason as if what affects one doesn’t affect the other. Before you tell them how bad Nigeria has come to be, they’ll quickly run under the canopy of ethnicity and cover themselves with the wrapper of mediocrity, spitting into the air and retrieving it with their face. If you try to point out the errors of the person whose boot they’re licking, they’ll be quick to label you a member of the opposition.
“Shut upjoor, I know you’re a PDP member. If you’re not PDP then you’re one of those Biafra boys,” they’ll say.
Their statement is deserving of an ecliptic slap. Sometimes, I’m bewildered at how they are above 18 years when I see them with their voters’ card. Who will tell their big ears that cannot hear that insecurity, unemployment, kidnapping, bad roads, poverty, and maladministration don’t know political party, ethnicity, or any geographic region?
If the image of Nigeria is destroyed in the international community, is it not all of us that will suffer for it? Who will be quarantined for thorough checks at the airport? Only Igbos,abi?Na all of us go suffer am.Victims of kidnapping aren’t from a particular state or region. SARS and Police will not ask for your state of origin before they brutalise and harass you.
When we say let’s fight this impunity and the corrupt Nigerian system together, they’ll request that you shut up and that all is well with the nation. All is really well with the dry well of a situation we have found ourselves. Sometimes they’ll even point accusing fingers at their opposition.
Bros, this nonsense happening in Nigeria is enough to go round. If you’re patient enough, you’ll eat the fattest bone of the results of the maladministration that has ravaged the land."
Nigerian first lady teaches pupils to wash their hands using ‘ultramodern’ technology,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-first-lady-teaches-pupils-to-wash-their-hands-using-ultramodern-technology/,2019-10-23T07:54:06+01:00,"ENUGU (The T.A. Report)― The first lady of Enugu State, Monica Ugwuanyi, has been sighted using a state-of-the-art facility to demonstrate contactless hand-washing to young secondary school students in celebration of the 2019 Global Hand-Washing Day.
The equipment, which sources say should cost no less than N150 million, is made up of two sturdy pieces of wood, placed parallel to each other and one stick strategically situated perpendicular to them. It boasts of a white made-in-Turkey 10-litre plastic keg linked to a user-friendly pedal about one metre in length. There is also a sizeable chunk of soap attached to it for multi-purpose use as well as cement debris scattered below it in a calculated manner to prevent soil erosion.
“This is indeed an ultra-modern facility befitting of our state,” Mrs Ugwuanyi was reported to have bragged at the event organised by her NGO, the Ugo’s Touch of Life Foundation.
She said there are plans to produce more of the prototype and distribute to schools and hospitals across the state. An updated version that will be suitable for use by people with disabilities is likewise currently being developed, she enthused.
“It is less stressful than what we are used to in cities across the country,” she added. “All you have to do is step out from the comfort of your classrooms into the sun, place your foot on the pedal to tilt the keg of water, and lean forward to rinse your hands vigorously, ensuring your legs are balanced and upright the entire time but your trunk is bent at an angle of about 45 degrees. And then, you refill the keg from the well as soon as the water is exhausted while making sure the pointed sticks don’t pierce your skin.”
Asked by one of the students if the state government house will be housing similar hand-washing equipment soon, Mrs Ugwuanyi chuckled and said her husband will definitely give it a thought.
Not much is known about our darling first lady, except that, with her technologically advanced prayers and affection for the downtrodden, she ispartly responsiblefor the unprecedented peace and development in Enugu State.
Read thisalmost-satirical profileof her by Chibuzor Anichukwu, wife of the Special Adviser (Media) to the Deputy President of the Senate:
“Coming to power with a promise to provide godly and humane leadership to the good people of Enugu State, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi had gone further to dedicate the state to God. In the face of dwindling federal allocation and recession, the governor also affirmed his belief in the miracle of five loaves and two fish.
“Building on this foundation, Mrs. Ugwuanyi took it upon herself to run with the task of recommitting Enugu into God’s hands on the 9th day of every month on the platform of the Enugu State Women Prayer Network. The result is that Enugu has been variously rated as one of the most peaceful and secured states in Nigeria. Also, whereas richer states lament of unable [sic.] to pay their workers and say there is a casting down, Enugu State has continued to witness a lifting up.

The discovery of ‘Nobody Holy’: A previously untold story,https://punocracy.com/the-discovery-of-nobody-holy/,2019-10-14T07:33:51+01:00,"The year is 2101. It is the dawn of a new century that has brought with it flying cars, talking animals, sentient robots, and a thriving republic of men on Mars. As always, ‘Geria, an underdeveloped country, sits quietly on the chest of Africa like a giant nipple. And like the male nipple, it is not an actor in this new era’s advanced system.
Once thought to be the continent’s heartbeat, pumping blood to the veins and arteries that needed life, ‘Geria has become one of few members of a new United Nations classification known as “endangered member-states”. The Security Council has been making moves to annex these countries to their better-performing neighbours. In the case of ‘Geria, the Benign Republic is a top candidate.
Experts have come up with tons of theories about what really contributed to the downfall of a once-promising nation, but one explanation stands out above all else:The discovery of ‘Nobody Holy’.
No one knows exactly when this discovery was made, but historians say it should be in the early years of the 21st century. It was like the discovery of crude oil all over again in the way it brought joy to the hearts of many a ‘Gerian. Like crude oil too, it changed the fortune of the country for good (as in permanently, of course).
‘Nobody holy.’
Only two words, but this combination of sounds into letters and of letters into syllables is unique to ‘Geria and has huge power people previously didn’t know existed.
Some say it was forged by an ancient sorcerer out of the last remnants of icing on ‘Geria’s national cake at the point where River Niger meets River Benue during a full moon. Some theorise that it was discovered by American scientists who then sent it to Nigeria as an experiment just like the Ebola virus, or that the words were carved onto the grave of Sani Abacha by unknown aliens. Others even suggest it was birthed after an unusual intercourse between aMarlianand aTacha Stan.  ——But regardless of what version is true, ‘Nobody Holy’ made its way to the hearts and tongue of all ‘Gerians, old and young, male and female, and everyone in-between. And that was when things started to fall apart.
Corrupt men became more corrupt and those thought incorruptible soon evolved to be the foremen of embezzlement.
Impunity increased to dramatic proportions ascourt-o-phobiafor politicians became a thing of the past. Offices of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission were colonised by weeds. And those still in use were converted to soccer betting centres and brothels. Persons who were ever charged with corruption simply waltzed into the courtroom, shook hands with the judge and prosecution counsel, and shared the booty with everyone.
It all started with those two, innocent-looking-but-highly-poisonous words: Nobody Holy.
At first, it was a taboo. Anyone who dared utter the words was banished or at least ostracised. He or she received the same treatment as did gay people in the dark days or non-non-binaries in the new era.
But, gradually, Nobody Holy became the catchphrase of every blessed ‘Gerian. As the American Dream is to the United States and ‘Long Live the Queen’ used to be to the United Kingdom, so was Nobody Holy to ‘Geria. It drowned the national anthem and the national pledge and (eventually) the national cake.
Not a day passed by without the words ringing through the air in every corner of the land. Toddlers chanted it in school. Choirs sang it in church. And even the heads of state made it a refrain in their Democracy Day speeches. “I may have failed you after eight long years, my fellow ‘Gerians, and achieved absolutely nothing from my campaign promises, but as we all know, ‘Nobody Holy’,” one of them famously concluded in 2025, as the people echoed his last words.
Fraudsters who drove foreigners into suicidal thoughts and manic depression through their evil ways were celebrities back at home because of the newly invented Nobody Holy philosophy. And as they went to mosques on Fridays and churches on Sundays to give to the lord, the lord’s agent could not possibly refuse the goodwill because, “As you know, brethren, none of us is holy.”
Lecturers who prowled proudly for vulnerable campus damsels and then preyed prayerfully on them, cold-blooded professors who roamed the cold room for fishy business transactions and specialised in female anatomy also had ‘Nobody Holy’ topping their trending vocabulary. “It was the devil” soon became unfashionable and the new magic phrase did all the trick.
“Nobody really is holy,” they often muttered self-righteously as their spectacles relaxed on their noses the same way they forced young girls’ bottoms atop their laps. On hearing these words, those previously having doubts about them regained their sanity as they perfectly understood the logic of how the fallibility of all men equalled the non-culpability of any man.
Also, people who complained about the lack of basic amenities 23 out of 24 hours in a day, who abused themselves because of traffic and bad roads, and harassed themselves with ugly generator noises because distribution companies refused to distribute electricity, would become soft as semo when the policymakers arrived in their flowing agbadas and babarigas. At the town hall meetings held once in 10 years like national censuses, they would murmur to themselves, as they pocketed beautiful brown-skin envelopes, that, “Besides, nobody holy… If some of us get there, we would even do worse.”
Simply put, the words were nothing short of a wand that allowed people to justify the most atrocious of crimes. Terrorists could get away with genocides, assassins with murder, armed robbers with violent theft, and the president with daring to take a second wife. The aftermath was disastrous.
And so did the once-promising Federal Republic of ‘Geria begin its descent down the hill of decency and relevance. Immorality took centre stage. Corruption sat comfortably on the iron throne. And no one gave half a hoot until it was too late. Nevertheless, no one took the blame for the historic fall of Africa’s giant.
After all, nobody holy."
"One Lagos, many troubles",https://punocracy.com/one-lagos-many-troubles/,2019-10-14T07:26:05+01:00,"By: Francis Olamide
Lagosians, I hail thee!
How was last week’s rain?
Hope it didn’t move your office from CMS to V.I? If you don’t know, please confirm before you head out to work. In these times, we have to sympathise with Lagos people. One governor was removed because he didn’t carry people along in line with the master’s masterplan. Thank God, flood will carry everyone along now. Or should we say Lagosians got what they deserve? –— a man of the people.
Let’s even say the truth. It’s obvious our governor is working. It’s not from my mouth you will hear that since our hardworking governor celebrated 100 days in office, he has been on flight mode — sorry, snooze mode (or just choose any of the two). The very solid achievement since 100 days in office is that omo daddyniBourdillon and his deputy have been able to arrest a few traffic offenders, especially those passing one-way.
Today, we hear Lagos is broke. Another day, we hear we cannot repair roads because it’s rainy season. Let’s just be praying that this rainy season doesn’t continue this way for four years… lest there will be no repair or construction of our roads. The job of fixing Lagos, a state with the fifth largest economy in Africa, isn’t an easy one.
Dear Lagosians, your agitation shouldn’t be that you have not yet begun to enjoy the dividends of democracy. The 45 minutes you previously used to spend from Agege to Oshodi has reduced to three hours, and that’s even the shortest. One time, I escorted my friend who was travelling to Ibadan to catch a bus at Berger. Interestingly, he got to Ibadan before I got to my house at V.I. Before now, a book keeps me company as I travel around Lagos. Now, the journey is usually so smooth that there is surplus traffic congestion and heavy headache to ensure you enjoy your book.
“Daddy let’s open our waterways and improve the rail system.” They said, “Shut up. Go brush your teeth. Your mouth is smelling, you know nothing about governance.” Well, maybe our amiable governor should be locked in a cage at a national museum so that people can come and be looking at what good governance looks like.
As you go out this week, better abandon your designer shoes and use rain boots.Igboro Eko tii daaru o. Also, add three hours to your journey in case flood has moved your office from Mainland to Island.Marina ti di marine. Don’t forget to pray as we wait upon the dry season to soothe our pain —  according to Mr Governor.Woh, if we start this Lagos matter, we no go finish.
Lakotan, the above is a work of fiction: any resemblance to anyone, any place, anything — dead or alive — is a coincidence. We will not be unfortunate."

The grand prize-winning entry, Igbinigie’sWhen You Speak of Africa, was described by one of the judges as “a really good entry that strikes at the heart of the satirical”.
Let the Good Works Continueauthored by the first runner-up, Winlade Isreal, was noted to have used “effective ironic subversions that offer a witty and funny sense of the state of things in Nigerian politics”. “Creatively fascinating,” the second judge said about it. “The speech format adopted shows a very distinct element of creativity.”
Coming third place, Obasa’sBecause You are Alivewas said to be a “good work with a solid gendered argument”. “A pretty brilliant, unpretentiously feminist intervention. Good prose,” another juror remarked.
Ranked right after the three submissions are:
Abdurrahman Bello Onifade’sOpen Letter to Mr President: Let’s Talk About the Muhammadu Buhari University: 4th place.
Ayodimeji Ameenat’sMarital Rapists are Like Bras; Here’s Why You Should Love Them: Joint 5th place.
Mazpa Ekejiuba Ejikem’sBecoming a Privileged Nigerian: Joint 5th place.
Timothy Edaki’sSatire 101: Introduction to Wife Battery and Assault: Honorable mention.
Obi Joy Ogechi’sA Day in the Life of a Kafayan Legislator: Honorable mention.
James Yékú’s brief note on theshortlisted entries:
The overall quality of the entries is quite good, although I expect that in subsequent editions, there would be stricter criteria that ensure the best submissions, especially entries that pay more attention to a certain standard of language expected at this level. Some of the best entries in the shortlist are unfortunately undermined by a communication style impervious to the most elementary details of punctuation and grammar.
One of the chief aims of satire—whether in literature, or any other means of artistic expressions is the way in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule. Ideally, this shaming of individuals or society should lead to improvement. Many of the entries in this collection do not really appear to have this intent clearly demonstrated, even though it is an implicit strategy most of them employ.
Rather than the more caustic Juvenalian tradition of satire that seeks to provoke anger with a view to inspiring change, most of the entries are Horatian in their orientation—provoking mere laughter even as they hold up society to constructive ridicule.
The top trio will be receiving cash and book prizes at the award ceremony next month, while all top eight entrants are entitled to receive certificates of excellence.
The ceremony/get-together is scheduled to be held at the University of Ibadan on Saturday, November 9, 2019. (Look out for the soon-to-be-released registration link!)
Hearty congratulations to the winners, once again, and to everyone who had enough courage to give it a shot.
Let’s do this again next year!"
"#SexForMark: Blame devil, not the lecturer",https://punocracy.com/sexformark-blame-devil-not-the-lecturer/,2019-10-09T06:02:59+01:00,"Mariam Hamzat
It has come to my notice that various social media pages are on fire and #Sexforgrade is trending. But in the middle of all of these, why don’t we calm down to consider certain truths which people are not talking about? I’m sure that some of my brothers are already arguing my facts in theCold Roomwithguilder bottlesandstudents by their sides.
First, Kiki Mordi did a good job of the investigation; but I wonder why she didn’t let us see the faces of the ladies she sent to those lecturers.Confamset up with beautiful babes, that is what it is!
How can you expect a fully grown man with blood running through his vein to see a beautiful underage and not fall, even though he has a wife at home?Hen, the man has testosterone now. It is not his fault. A truth that remains unshaken is that those girls were beautiful, the compliments affirmed that. Let’s try again with ugly girls,maybethey won’t fall this time.
Again, why would you need help with admission if not that you want something else?Abiwhen did a lecturer become admission officer? The departments are entirely different from the other; but those ladies’ visits had something to concoct. It means they were ready to do anything for what they want. Who are the lecturers to be blamed when students have been known to offer themselves?
In this lifehen, you need experience, because it is the best teacher. Thatcold room experiencewas just part of what she needed to learn. Eventually, she will have a boyfriend on campus and will be good to go. That one with boyfriend who is getting an older man offering to be herside manyen,she simply needs more experience for future purpose.
Now, to those ladies who wore mask. One thing you should know is that if people want to bring you down, they will go to any length. How are we sure that they are not students who want to destroy the seducer’s (I mean lecturer’s) ministry because they failed a course or two?
By the way, the incidence could have happened when the men of men (sorry, men with untamed goads) were high on libido. It happens. God forbid that the ladies were really harassed. Let them take their masks off, if they are sure.
Finally, maybe those lecturers might have made fatal mistakes in the video. Let’s do it all over, they’ll pass. Or better, let the world forgive them and forget the issue, like Nigerians have been known to do. Let’s move to the next topic.  We’ll pray that they do not “fall into temptation” again while the authorities are handling it and conducting their own investigation."
"Nigeria changes currency from naira to ‘long leg’, says policy ‘long overdue’",https://punocracy.com/nigeria-changes-currency-from-naira-to-long-leg-says-policy-long-overdue/,2019-10-06T08:05:42+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― In what has been touted a never-before-seen shift in economic policy, the Central Bank of Nigeria has announced that the naira will soon be out of circulation to pave the way for a new mode of making payment: “long legs”.
Isaac Okorafor, the apex bank’s spokesperson, made the historic announcement on Saturday, describing the policy shift as groundbreaking and long-overdue.
“The naira is fast becoming not only unfashionable but also an embarrassment,” Okorafor wrote in a press statement signed by the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, and Chief of Staff Abba Kyari. “The economic recession we faced and an all-time high inflation rate figures have made our currency the laughing stock of all countries, including even Ghana and the Republic of Benin. We can’t have that.”
“We naturally figured it’s high time we tried out something totally different, something truly Nigerian,” he continued. “Our 20-man-2-woman high-level committee reached a unanimous decision that the country should look inward for a solution.
“People already use long legs to technically make payments for services. It’s done in schools, at hospitals, on the highway, even in churches, and so on. So we said, ‘Hey; why not just make this thing official?'”
Okorafor clarified that the long legs the bank is referring to are not those of a tall woman used to prey on unsuspecting victims, but the local slang used by Nigerians to refer to extraordinary privileges and favouritism, also popularly known as “connection”.
“We will, as from January next year, have two currencies: long legs, the new naira, and short legs, the new kobo. We’re really excited to see this take off.”
It is not clear yet what form this new payment is going to take, but the bank says it won’t be losing focus on its controversial cashless policy and will be taxing every transaction. It is hopeful the new policy will bridge the gap between the rich and poor, since emphasis will no longer be on how much you have but who you know.
“It will also improve networking and bonding among Nigerians,” CBN’s spokesperson enthused. “It might even put an end to ethnic rivalry and the farmer-herdsmen clashes.”
The only challenge currently being sorted out is exactly how to quantify the new legal tender.
Right now, estimates from experts state that, for example, 50 short legs can get you a stranger’s phone number, and 5 long legs can get you free entrance into a concert or pass on the express though without up-to-date papers. 10 long legs should be able to get a student admission into any public school, and with 200 long legs, it doesn’t matter how badly behaved you are or where you get evicted from, Nigerians will proclaim love for you and even raise money on your behalf.
“There’s simply no limits to its application,” the CBN said. “It is revolutionary and forward-thinking. And the best part is it’s the first advancement we’ll be having before Egypt, South Africa, and even the United States.”

"Independence Day: Abuja civil servants celebrate in style, take two months break",https://punocracy.com/independence-day-abuja-civil-servants-celebrate-in-style-take-two-months-break/,2019-10-01T09:19:08+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― The streets and government-run workplaces in Abuja have become deserted as civil servants celebrate Nigeria’s 59th independence anniversary in grand style.
Reports indicate that “as a show of patriotism”, thousands of workers have travelled out of the Federal Capital Territory as early as the last week of August in preparation for the big day.
Though there is no circular to the effect, many are not expected to return to work until the end of October after the monthly salary must have been paid.
“It is an unwritten rule,” explained a director at one of the country’s juicy ministries, who pleaded to not have his name mentioned because “Big Brother DSS is watching”.
“Nigerian civil servants are not only very patriotic, we are also religious people who love spending time with family and friends. If you notice, whenever it is Christmas, Easter, or Eid period, we also take our time to celebrate.
“Making Nigeria a better country cannot be achieved in the offices alone,” he added. “We also need to encourage people to travel, go on vacation to relax their mind and muscle, and go for vigils and 7-day revival or redemption programmes in order to put the economy in prayers.”
“It is really just an attestation to the government’s commitment to worker welfare and the unfettered freedom of its people,” he said.
According to statistics not gotten from civil servants, many employees of the Federal Government resume at work an average of three hours late and close for the day at least two hours before official lights out.
“We must not forget that Fridays are partly work-free days as well, especially for Muslim faithful,” said the director. “There are two standard options: it is either you go home from the Jum’at service at noon, or you don’t resume at work until after the prayer.”
Meanwhile, civil servants in Nigeria are also notorious for their unique hospitality.
“They never get tired of seeing your face,” a resident of Apo Resettlement,  Alamu Onibode, tells the T.A. Report as he wears a tired smile.
“I’ve been trying to get a permit from the Ministry of Science and Technology since 1992,” he explained. “But each time I visit, the employees there always nicely ask me to come back. Sometimes, their network is down. Sometimes, the boss has travelled. Sometimes, they won’t be able to trace my file. But never have they completely shut me out.”
“They don’t even ask that I sign in anymore. All the security guards already know me by name,” he chuckled.
Nigeria is noted for its generosity in recruiting people into the civil service. The country, unlike many others, does not discriminate against people who are stark computer illiterates, unable to pass aptitude tests, cannot communicate effectively, or do not even have college degrees.
As a result, the Nigerian civil service is one of the most colourful and versatile in the world. Someone employed as a secretary, for instance, may spend most of their time plaiting the hair of coworkers or selling call cards. Also, it is not uncommon to find a deputy director of ICT being more productive at picking beans during work hours.

How to kill a language: The death of Yoruba,https://punocracy.com/how-to-kill-a-language-the-death-of-yoruba/,2019-09-30T17:43:38+01:00,"A
 language is a system of communication which consists of a set of sounds
 and written symbols which are used by the people of a country, region 
or community for speaking and for writing. It is said to be an 
embodiment of their culture and traditions, and to be intricately tied 
to their sense of being, identification and belonging. Take away a 
people’s language, and you take away their sense of worth and belonging.
 The disconnect engendered by this loss almost always leaves them open 
for the reception and adoption of a new language with its attendant 
culture and traditions thereby paving the way for the death of their own
 language.
As
 a modern day colonial looking to expand the influence of Her Majesty, 
your Queen; to all corners of the earth, there is no medium better than 
your language to preach this gospel.
And so, without further ado, this is how you kill a language:
This
 you do through conquest, trade, assimilation, religion… Whichever 
poison you prefer. You ridicule their traditions, you take away their 
language, you take away their identity. You subjugate them using every 
means at your disposal such that they become and see themselves more or 
less as a part of you.
After
 colonization, comes re-education. There will be “infidelic” 
non-believers amongst your new people. These whilst exhibiting a modicum
 of compliance in public, are defiant of your gospel of change in 
private. Since they cannot openly oppose you, they will pass their 
language, culture and traditions down to their children in a bid to 
prevent the extinction that must surely come from your dominance.
This
 defiance on their part you must make sure must be in vain. You must 
teach their offspring, their supposed last bastion, that speaking their 
language, their mother tongue is vernacular. If they like their parents 
choose to be defiant by uttering a word of ‘their’ primitive language, 
you impose sanctions on them. N20 (Twenty naira) for every word (of 
Yoruba) that escapes their mouth in official places. This will 
ultimately discourage them from attempting to allow the uncouth drivel 
escape their lips.
This however you must note is still not enough to kill a language.
You
 do this by portraying the mastery of your language as the ultimate 
ideal. Every word that escapes from their lips must be properly 
dictioned. With the accent to accompany it. Proper Queen’s English and 
nothing more so pretentious. Anybody with ‘H’ factor will be deemed a 
second-class citizen and will need to shape up or be left behind. Shame 
in this instance will be your greatest weapon. Parents will endeavor to 
send their children to the best schools in their country where your own 
educational curriculum will be employed. It will no longer be ‘A’ for 
Apple but ‘ah’ for Apple. Picture perfect English as portrayed by every 
on-air personality.
At
 this stage, the majority of your work will have already been done. The 
offspring at this stage may hear and understand their mother tongue, but
 they will be hard pressed to speak or write it even at the pain of 
death and as such, they will have little or nothing to transmit to their
 own offspring. And whilst you still have to be vigilant, be rest 
assured that 300 (three hundred) years from now, when a vintage copy of 
Fagunwa’s Ogboju Ode turns up at an archeological dig at the site of 
what may have once been Ibadan, there will be no native speaker to 
decipher it, Yoruba will have become a lost language, and in that 
moment, your work will have been done.
Shalom.
This  post was inspired by a tweet from Kola Tubosun wherein he stated to  have heard a Yoruba recording from the 1920s and how it was so much  different from the one we currently speak. Our parents can read, write  and speak Yoruba, we their children can read, write and speak Yoruba to  an extent. Our children hear or will hear Yoruba but will barely be able  to speak, read or write the language. Their children will be able to do  none of those and this I tell you, is the saddest sadness of all.
Yoruba as used in this post is metaphor for indigenous Nigerian Languages."
When courts become degree-awarding institutions… (II),https://punocracy.com/when-courts-become-degree-awarding-institutions-ii/,2019-09-28T13:05:22+01:00,"By: Isaac “O’Zik” Omole
“Las las, school na scam. Las las, school na scam…”Those were the words on the lips of these young men, or should I call them boys, in the bar.
I was sitting at this bar on this fateful Saturday evening, getting some fresh air and sipping some bottles of Star Radler. These boys were making all the noise inside. Their table had more bottles and they dressed better than everyone else. They had gold chains on, and apparently, they all came with their cars. I don’t know the kind of job(s) they are engaged in but they looked like those boys who help white men cash out their money in Nigeria (I didn’t say yahoo boys o. Let’s be guided.)
What led to to the words uttered, I don’t know. But I remember that it coincided with the time the news of the ruling of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal was broken.
When the newscaster on the TV broke the news, laughter enveloped the bar. Some were like, “I don sabi sey na so hin go be.” Some said, “Naija, Naija; everything for Naija dey everly dey predictable.” Another also said tongue-in-cheek in fluent pidgin English, “How you wan make dem deliver judgment against the President, that one fit amount to disloyalty and treasonable felony o.”
At the same time, some were praising the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal for the ruling. They said it was that kind of ruling that would really benefit the common man. And that the judiciary has continued to make the country better and better with wonderful judgments like that, especially the one that has to do with the validity of the affidavit stating that the President has a WASSCE result.
Before I left the bar, I made friends with one of those young boys, and we had a very interesting conversation—one that’s actually shaped my view of the educational sector and the judiciary.
Whilst we were at the bar, I went outside to receive a call and met him. He just finished receiving a call. He was looking at me like he knew me. Next thing, he approached me and asked if I knew ‘Soji Omole, with whom he was classmates at Lagos State Polytechnic. I told him ‘Soji is my brother. He said he thought so too; the resemblance was too much. He asked about Soji’s whereabouts, I told him he was fine. I asked him what he was up to, and he replied, “Man gats to do what man gats to do. I dropped out of Laspotech so I could face my hustle. And now, I don dey cash out big time. School that year na distraction for me.”
He continued: “Na me get that car wey dey for that side. Na the money from the hustle I use get am. And I no think sey I even need go school get degree again. With wetin I see for news today, if I need degree, I go just go swear affidavit sey I get degree for this and that school, and that’s all. For now sef, I no need degree, I still wan make money. But if need for degree show, I sabi how to get am legally. My bro, na everyday Naija dey make sense, abi wetin you think?”
I could not agree less with him that Nigeria is indeed making more sense daily. Then I pondered on his words, “… I sabi how to get am legally.” Wow! He actually did hit the nail on the head. Based on the recent Presidential Election PetitionTribunal ruling, an affidavit stating that you possess this and that degree is legal and admissible anywhere.
From the conversation I had with that young man, I realised how beneficial the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal judgment is to the common man, the society, and Nigeria as a country. It has even showed how much the judiciary can affect the society positively.
That decision of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal will surely reduce perjury, forgery, corruption, false results being tendered. It will increase the number of degree holders in Nigeria. It will increase the number of “graduates ”. It will increase Nigeria’s “literacy” level. It will make getting degrees very easy. It will ease Nigerians of the stress of sitting for useless exams –WASSCE, SSCE, UTME etc. It will help to depopulate the already populated tertiary institutions. And it will help put Nigeria on the world map in terms of education.
I think we need to applaud the Nigerian Judiciary. I think the decision of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal on the result of President is a landmark, remarkable, and outstanding one. I also do think it is a world-class judgment. It is one that should be emulated by not-so-good judiciaries of countries like the United Kingdom, United States of America etc. Other African countries should emulate this judgment. And why shouldn’t they? Isn’t Nigeria the “Giant of Africa”. They naturally should follow the footsteps of their “Big Brother”.
The economic, political, social, socioeconomic and overall merits of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal’s verdict, with regards to the result of Mr President, can never be downplayed or underestimated. That verdict is a step in the right direction and a pointer to the fact that Nigeria keeps getting better and better. The judiciary is also getting better and better at delivering jawbreaking and outstanding judgments.
The positive trends associated to the Nigerian Judiciary and the recent judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal has left me with no choice than to say, “Nigeria, I hail thee!”"
When courts become degree-awarding institutions…,https://punocracy.com/when-courts-become-degree-awarding-institutions/,2019-09-25T09:10:13+01:00,"By: Isaac “O’Zik” Omole
Last week, I met a friend of mine; he is a Mechanic, a skilled one at that. 29 years of age, but he has a couple of “certificates”. We were talking while I was in his shop and he informed me of his plans to swear an affidavit stating that he had a BSc and MSc in Mechanical Engineering from one of these Nigerian Universities. I laughed. I laughed till my cheekbones started to hurt. I asked why he would do so; he then brought out a newspaper. In it, the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, while ruling on the president’s academic qualifications, stated that the affidavit sworn by Buhari that he had a WASSCE result was valid and could be tendered as a qualification for him to contest.
My Friend, Tunji, then told me he now has trust in the Nigerian Judicial system and that the decision has so many benefits. He stated that he would be swearing the affidavit(s) soon. He even confided in me that he could use it to apply for jobs in big firms in need of a mechanic or mechanical engineer or perhaps might add it to his credentials when he contests for his area’s councilorship position.
To be sincere with you, I couldn’t agree with him less. He had stated the “gospel truth”. Why do we even need to sweat to pass WASSCE when we can just swear an affidavit of our results? Why should we go spend four, five, or six years in the university when we can just swear an affidavit of our degrees? Why do we have to spend years in the Polytechnics, Monotechnics, and Colleges of Education when we can “swear to God who made us” we graduated from there?
Truth be told, things get easier and easier in Nigeria. The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal has just made life easy. Now, we just need a paltry sum of money to have our degrees and certificates. Can life be easier than that? No, It can’t! Don’t I just love this country? I do, I swear.
Three days ago, I was talking to a street brother. We talked at length. He then asked me of the essence of an affidavit. I told him, based on the little knowledge of law I had. He then revealed to me that he needed to swear to having a PGD and MSc in his affidavit since affidavit evidence is quite admissible. He wants to apply to a big firm in Lagos and they need an MSc holder to fill in the position he is applying for.
Based on the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal ruling, he can tender the affidavit he intends swearing at the firm and he would cite the case ofAbubakar Atiku v. Mohammadu Buhari, APC, & INECas a locus classicus. I had no choice than to shower him a round of applause; he got a sitting and a standing ovation too. I was wowed at his level of intelligence and how he could tap into the social benefits of the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal.
I think we need to give the judiciary kudos. Lately, they have been delivering sound and impeccable judgments. They have been delivering judgments that have had positive impacts on the Nigerian politicosphere and the nation at large. Where would Nigeria have been without the judiciary? It has always been the hope of the common man. In fact, the judgment on the President’s result saga is the best I have seen in recent times; it shows how unbiased they are and how much they have the interests of the common man at heart.
I think I need to rest my pen now. We will discuss more of this result saga at a later time."
Criminal prosecution 101: How to battle corruption; Nigerian Style!,https://punocracy.com/criminal-prosecution-101-how-to-battle-corruption-nigerian-style/,2019-09-23T11:31:19+01:00,"Are you a concerned Nigerian Citizen? Do you want to prosecute high profile criminal cases and battle the endemic disease; Corruption, that has eaten deep into the fabric of the Nigerian Society? Do you want to learn how to prosecute high profile criminal cases and battle Corruption Nigerian Style? Then look no further, I gat you.  Just follow the tips I have endeavoured to give below, and all will be well with you.
Shalom.
It is no secret that fighting corruption in Nigeria is dangerous. It is a truth that has been trumpeted and ingrained in the very fabric of this nation. However, as the brave anti corruption crusader that you are, I am sure that these grave tidings will not dissuade you nor give you cause to pause in your quest to attain a Corruption free Nigeria.
Thus, the first thing you must do if you want to successfully battle corruption and prosecute high profile criminal cases in Nigeria is to go and ‘bust’them; the criminals, in their respective homes in the dead of the night commando style. (After you must have done your  “investigation” of course). These so called criminals, looters of our collective wealth, thieves all of them. They should not be allowed to  escape the wrath of the law.
Now, when you do this, do not avert your mind to the rule of law,  democracy, due process, equality before the law and the likes, those arekumbayaconcepts and they exist only in vacuum. This is Nigeria and we do as we want. Just ask El Zakzaky and Sambo Dasuki; all you need to do is to ‘Invite’ them for questioning, hold them incommunicado and grill them  (yes o, you must grill them… otherwise… ) for one week then they’ll know  you mean business.
Quick tip:See ehn, in this kind of operation, the  media is your best friend. Generate furore. Tell them you recovered so so so and so amount of money in naira or dollars in the “criminal’s”  bedroom, soakaway, water tank whichever one works for you. Give them tidbits of the full picture and let their creative minds go to work.
The next thing you will want to do is to draft a hundred count charge. Don’t worry… The higher the number of offences you charge them with, the  higher your chances of securing a conviction. Forget all thosealakowecharge and bail lawyers shouting proof. Proof? What is proof? They think they’re the only ones that knows the law? You just file those hundred counts anyhow anyhow, e bad as e bad, one out of the 100 go  catch am sha ni.
Quick tip:It’s not enough that you’re working, the people  must know you’re working.  And how will the people know that you’re  working if they don’t know you’re working? Simple. You leak it. You gotta let the people try the case and hand you your judgement even before you enter the court of law. The more outraged  the common man, the more your chances of securing a conviction in court.
When you get to court, just call your witnesses, let them come and  tell the court the truth of the matter. You don’t even need to prepare them for questioning or have a trial plan you’ll adhere to. Afterall, the truth as they say must surely prevail and liars, all of them, they go to hellfire.
Upon cross examination when defence counsel destroys your witnesses in the box, do not panic, maintain philosophical calmness. All you need do is establish a prima facie case for them to answer to. Damn their no case submission, hundred count charge still popping.
Quick tip:Peradventure hundred count does not pop, it’s still not yet time to panic. Just call the media and say some choice  words to them. Who section 27 RPC epp? Talk to the media! Tell them!! Tell it all to them!!! Tell them that the judiciary has been compromised and that was how you lost your case. Tell them that the bench is corrupt and that you’ve already filed an appeal against the  decision of the trial court. Yes, we both know that filing a notice of appeal does not equate to entering an appeal simpliciter but the people don’t need to know that. All they need to know is that you’ve filed an  appeal shikena. Hook, line and sinker, na so dem go chop am. Let their  twitter fingers go to war against corruption.
Now, all of these will have been a long day’s job.  So at the end of  it, you’ll need to sit back, sipmoringa,odekwuor whatever your poison  is and enjoy the circus while it lasts.
Do these religiously and as often as you please, and all will be well with you.
Shalom.

September to remember,https://punocracy.com/september-to-remember/,2019-09-23T07:14:02+01:00,"By: Francis Olamide
Dear Diary,
I’m not telling you about the toothless corruption crusade that our leader has used to becloud people’s judgement here—I’ll tell you that another day. Well, some quarters believe the fight is going on strong. Especially with the way prisons (sorry, correctional centers) have been congested with looters.
Diary, did you know it’s treason toyarbMr President too? Mr Sowore’s mosquito has landed on PMB’s scrotum—he is the latest victim. But who is a treasonable felon? The person who toppled Shagari’s civilian govt. through a military coup or the one who complained of the decadence in the system?
I want to tell you a few things that happened in September.
Especially the ones that reached those at home and abroad. Can’t you see our
God is wonderful? The land flowed with so much milk and honey that it even
reached those abroad.
1. Closure of the border to encourage local rice production.
Diary, this one weak me. Nigeria can feed Africa, Nigeria
can feed Africa; when will it happen? Abi is it a prayer point they’re raising
for us to launch into the heavens?
I bought rice this month only to discover it came with plenty free meats. You know those meats that can rearrange your dental formula? It was full of stones. FG sentenced us to eating our local rice when they locked the border. Do we still need a prophet to tell us we are not up to the task? Especially the affidavit agriculture minister we have been having after Mr Akinwunmi.
I told some agriculturists that only a nation that hasbelle-fulland has surplus closes her borders. They threw me out through the balcony asking if I didn’t see the surplus rice PMB has provided. No rice mill is adequately functioning yet you closed the border. One will think those who should be working with Mr President should know better. Well, Baba has even outsourced the nation to daddy Abba leaving the nation with two VPs: one for Admin, the other for condolence visits.
2. Xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in SA
May we never enter trouble that will require our country’s help. Diary, those SA boys started again, the exact way they usually pamper our Nigerian brothers there. It was out of this act of care that many Nigerians lost their lives, businesses, and family to the cold hands of death.
Guess what, Baba handled it very well. He met Ramaphosa and took some fine pictures with him. We used SA’s eyes to see trobule o. Bubu sent a delegation as soon as possible to SA, only that they moved so fast that it took four days to arrive there.
It was during this gallant fight against SA that we got so engaged and forgot we had to evacuate our citizens from SA. Thank God for Air Peace that peacefully shouldered the responsibility of the Nigerians who opted to move from SA’s frying pan to Nigeria’s fire.
As talk no deh tire us, we’re still discussing how to get compensation for damages for weeks now until we will arrive at a silent bustop. Aunty Dabiri haskukupromised those that returned N40,000 worth of recharge card with free data to empower them. I hope it’ll be enough to update those still in SA, “Please tell my family not to come o. It’s not how I thought it’ll be. The milk flowing here is sour and the bees producing honey are on exile.”
3. VAT, bank deposit and withdrawal charges
Our financial sector became so full of productive ideas that they want to kill the common man with various kinds of levies disguised as VAT/deposit and withdrawal charges. There is no hardship in the land, our spending power is strong and Amrica cannot even meet up with our GDP; so, they decided to collect some money from us.
VAT increased from 5% to 7.2% so that minimum wage—the one they’ve been using to scam us since last year—can be paid.
These finance people got so mentally strong that they want
to drain from any source they see. After rubbing us with multidimensional
poverty oil, they still want to take out of the little we’re managing to
survive on.
Even people with affidavit certificates in finance can’t think of creative ways for a nation to earn rather than taxing the poor so hard. With N500,000 in my account now, I have to pay the bank N20,000 as withdrawal charges and N15,000 to deposit the same amount of money. Very soon, we’ll be contributing money to the government to repair roads, provide power, and enhance security. Abeg, let’s just end this September. I hope in this new week, another news that’ll fuel the frustration of Nigerians will not surface again. See you later, diary."
The Nigerian government’s guide to road maintenance,https://punocracy.com/the-nigerian-governments-guide-to-road-maintenance/,2019-09-22T08:29:09+01:00,"Nigeria is a special country. And I don’t mean “special” in the same sense as “physically challenged” or “less privileged” (we all know the country is as fit as a butcher’s dog). I mean our modes of operation here are simply unique. We have abundant resources yet, like the typical Nigerian mother, we have decided to, you know, manage. It’s what we do best and it’s almost as if the austerity measures adopted for the Structural Adjustment Programme of the 1980s still haunt us from their graves.
Managing, or what you may call our Advanced Coping Mechanisms (ACMs), is what makes Nigeria such a great country. It is why couples who collectively earn less than the national minimum wage also collectively give birth above the national birth rate average—because, you know, “we will manage” and, you know, “God will do it”.
It is, in fact, the bond that has cemented this country of over 200 million people, hailing from different ethnicities and wailing in different tongues, for nearly sixty decades—because, you know, “we will manage” and, you know, “it is God’s plan”.
Let us not forget that our ACMs are also responsible for making life much easier for our leaders. Not only do we elect them using ELDS cut-off marks and federal character, but we are also hardly shocked by their incompetence. Our ACMs have made us a nation of happy people who don’t sweat the small stuff (especially when that “small stuff” is the responsibility of elected officials)—because, you know, “we can manage” and, you know, “e go better”.
Anyway, it is this same ACM formula our leaders apply to the governance. As we manage them, so also have they taken to help us “manage” our “abundant” resources. And there’s no sector where this is more evident than in road maintenance under the ministry of works.
There are some silly countries, such as Canada, that have created online forms and helplines just for people to complain about potholes. Every year, the city of Toronto alonespends millionsof dollars repairing hundreds of thousands of potholes and then—wait for it—also gives progress reports to the people about how many potholes they’ve massacred. Who does that? Aren’t they aware that potholes are citizens with fundamental human rights? Don’t they know they are a necessary evil that deserve to be treated with love, care, and respect?
Even if you are going to go down the harsh, inhuman road of exterminating potholes, at least have the decency to make the repair temporary so the pothole can, within a few months, see the light of day again.
Also, always remember to take into account the country’s “abundant” resources, which you must spend as uneagerly as possible. To do that, prioritisation is needed. It is only a man with filled pockets that goes about filling potholes like a madman.
Besides(B), if you do it excessively and arbitrarily, it doesn’t become special anymore when you announce it as an achievement. You won’t be able to commission all the repaired potholes and people will think you are not working. And there won’t be swagger in press statements that declare your government has just repaired so and so kilometres of road at so and so community.
Post besides (PB), potholes have proven to be a reliable and stress-free source of job creation. Good roads don’t attract unemployed youth who fill up potholes with stones and leaves and “tuale” every road user who drives by for cash. Only bad roads can pull that off.
Post post besides (PPB), bad roads have also been established to lead to fewer accidents (according to unpublished research papers of the Buhari Media Organisation). Political scientists say there is nothing in their anatomy that materially distinguishes them from speedbumps. Because of this, potholes in some political corridors now have the nickname, “inverted bumps”. Nigerians get too excited and tend to forget their driving school lessons when a road is flawless. This, of course, causes accidents.
So, take heed. You have to apply sense and make pothole-filling as rare as the blood moon. That is the only way to maximise resources and at the same time remain politically relevant. So according to guidelines followed by any Nigerian politician who knows his onions, here are some of the occasions where maintaining roads will become, sort of, necessary (any other time is honestly a waste of energy):
If the country were hosting the Olympic games, that would certainly be a valid reason to do some road maintenance. But not everything; only the road networks that are calculated to be important for our national image. The stretch of the road from the airport to the hotel is of paramount importance, for instance. Then, the one that leads to the stadium from the hotel as well as those that connect to the national hospital. You get the drift, uhn?
Please note that I said Olympic games. This level of proactiveness does not apply in the event that the country hosts smaller sport events like the African Nations Championship or the Africa Cup of Nations.
Reports have alreadyshownthere’s always a sharp spike in road repairs in the buildup to presidential and gubernatorial elections. This is no miracle or coincidence. It is simply part of the prioritisation process.
Did I hear someone mutter “vote-buying?” Haha, don’t be daffy! It is simply because people travel a lot during these seasons and politicians want them to get to their destination on time so they don’t miss the accreditation and voting processes.
Yes, this is another occasion that calls for the rehabilitation of roads. We can’t have heads of government and heads of state from our junior brother-African countries coming to embarrass us—especially when your party has just been re-elected.
In this case, don’t just repair the roads. Also, re-paint the white walls of the capital territory’s City Gate. And if you can temporarily erect in different strategic locations a giant broom or whatever object from your party logo, that’ll be cool too. It’s all part of thanksgiving.
This is not a very high priority situation though, especially if big man has an SUV worth millions of naira with a Bilstein 24-186742 5100 series shock absorber.
“Big man” is anyone ranging from the president to the local government chairman or a special adviser to any of these or a personal assistant to any of the aforementioned. In certain situations, the term is also expanded to include family members or close associates or lovers or concubines of any of the listed persons.
In no circumstances should big man be made even slightly uncomfortable. Because if big man has a headache, big man has to go to Europe to treat it, spending millions of dollars that could have been better lavished back at home. And, you know, everyone loses.
In fact, if you can, declare not only a state of emergency but a national day of mourning. If one big man dies there, owing to the Law of Big Man Gravitational Pull, then there’s the possibility that more Big Men frequent the same road and are likely to suffer similar fates. We can’t have that.
If some Big Man is unlucky to die by road accident today, the road has to be fixed the next day. So goes to the guideline.
Some people prefer to call it embezzlement or misappropriation of funds, but let’s not be too harsh about it. It really is just extra-budgetary income. Road maintenance can be a quick avenue to make some extra bucks.
In Nigeria, there’s no limit to how much you can spend on one kilometre of road—whether building from scratch or simply repairing. If you tell your people you spent all of the state’s treasury constructing 10 kilometres of double lanes, they’ll believe you, as long as you make sure to convert the figure to dollars first. No one will bother checking the naira equivalent.
So, yeah, repair roads. Budget N10 billion, though the contractor only asked for N2 billion. Eventually, give him only N500 million. What in Pete’s name is a drainage system? What are road signs? What are streetlights or speedbumps? C’mon, we don’t do that here! So, N500 million should do. You need another N500 million to organise a ceremony to launch the project. And the rest, they say ishistoryluxury—because, you know, Nigerians justloveto manage."
How to become the most peaceful university in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-become-the-most-peaceful-university-in-nigeria/,2019-09-11T07:46:04+01:00,"By: Emelife Uc
Becoming the most peaceful university in Nigeria requires that you make peace your number one priority. This is because the standard of a higher institution is neither determined by her academic excellence nor the beauty of her structures, it is solely on the grounds of peace. How peaceful is the university? How much a haven is it for her students?
The average university is a war zone and no one really cares about how well-equipped your labs are or how poor your library is or how impoverished your structures are. Nobody cares about these things. So if you’re looking to be ranked better, from the rare or front, doesn’t matter, the aim of your university should not be to school, but to provide a safe haven. This peace, however, must only be relative at face-value. And maintaining face-value peace may be a herculean task, but what am I here for if not to make things easier for you? Here are ten (10) easy, tested and trusted guidelines on how to maintain face-value peace:
1. Print out a thousand flyers with the name of your institution (say“Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto”) boldly written on them.
Right below the name should be the prophetic claim that you’re actually “The Most Peaceful University In Nigeria”.
2. Paste it on every nook and cranny of your
institution.
If you crave greater peace, make a billboard out of it and mount it on every major students’ hangout site.
3. Command your minions, sorry students, to proclaim the label in arguments.
When your students get into arguments with students from other institutions, while those students proudly make submissions over little accolades like having the best medical school or being among the top 50 universities in the world, tell yours to not feel inferior. They have the best quality any institution can offer. Peace.
So tell them to say, “My university may be awful in every other thing, our lecture halls may not be properly ventilated, and our hostels are homes to mosquitoes, but we are the most peaceful university in Nigeria.” Then they should doff their hats, flip their hair for the females, and slyly walk out like winners that they are.
4. Instruct your staff to turn it to a mantra.
When they come in to class, they should greet the students this way: “Good morning students and welcome to the most peaceful university in Nigeria”. And they should repeat it for at least seven times all through the two-hour lecture, because peace when perpetually spoken into existence becomes reality.
5. Make it your institution’s slogan. Forget the “Better by Far” that others use. What way are they better? Because they’ve more equipped labs and spacious lecture theatres? Because they have more versed and competent lecturers? What’re all those compared to what you have? (Okay, you don’t really have it yet, so rather, what I’m showing you how to have.) Peace is underrated if you ask me.
6. Misplace your priorities.
Yes, you read that right. Misplace your priorities. You’ve got the Nigerian government to look up to as your model administration. For instance, tell your security men to abandon the whole foolhardy agenda of protecting lives and property. After all, we are all living to die someday or as Soyinka aptly captured it: “…dying by instalments”, and these properties will not follow us to the beyond. So tell them not to worry about safeguarding the institution, and to instead invest the energy in harassing students who dress indecently. If you ask me, the killings in Nigeria today is as a result of indecent dressing. So you’re doing humanity a favour.
7. Be reluctant about security since you have no
cultists.
You’re trying to become the most peaceful university in Nigeria and you’re lucky that there are no cult groups. What’s more to do than to develop a reluctance towards security? That aside, what is even the relationship between security and peace? You can be peaceful and still have poor security measures. Lucifer won’t judge you.
8. Be indifferent to security breaches.
Again, we are all living to die. If God has destined that, on a particular day, some of your students will be attacked by armed masked men, or vehicles get stolen, accept it in good fate. Fold your arms and say nothing about it. If they have a problem with it, they should take it up with God. Your duty is to ensure peace and that is exactly what you’ve done with the adoption of the previous steps.
9. Have a sycophantic Student Union.
Very important. Ensure that the leaders of your SU are sycophants. Their badly written press releases must speak well of the institution, and if there is tension amongst students over several security breaches, instruct them to make a statement that debunks obvious and factual happenings. You’re a lover of peace, a little die (sorry, lie) don’t hurt nobody.
10. Tell your lead security personnel to publicly declare
his incompetence.
It is the 21st century, and there are some hyperactive students who parade themselves as campus journalists. Beware of this kind. They will pester you for interviews and insist even after turning them down. When you grow weary of the disturbance and choose to do their bidding, instruct your ‘Maiguard’ to declare his incompetence when asked about the security of the institution. Tell him to say things like, “Security is your personal responsibility” and go further to advise students to not walk alone at night. Ensure he doesn’t reveal a single security measure put up to curb insecurity, because there actually is none, and you don’t support lying because honesty is one of the ways of ensuring peace.
The above steps have been adopted by a federal university
near you, and there is no gainsaying reminding you that indeed it is now ranked
as the most peaceful university in Nigeria.

"Nigeria Air, Africa’s largest airline, to suspend activities to South Africa",https://punocracy.com/nigeria-air-africas-largest-airline-to-suspend-activities-to-south-africa/,2019-09-10T07:13:20+01:00,"By: Raheem Hammed Gbolahan
I am sure you would agree with me, that the President of Nigeria is swift at responding to issues within and outside the country. There’s one thing I don’t like about you Nigerians: you paint Baba as though he’s one-sided, when in fact he made it clear to you all that he belonged to everybody and belonged to nobody.
At least it took him some two weeks or more to condemn the attack in Benue state that year, and few hours to secure the release of one Zainab involved in a drug saga in Saudi Arabia. That’s not even our major concern in today’s report. The recent attacks targeted at Nigerians living and making something meaningful for themselves in South Africa by South Africans is alarming. Recall that Ibrought it to the attentionof Mr. President the last time? Maybe the message didn’t get to him and stopped at the desk of the chief of staff, or it got to him but, due to one reason or the other, he skipped reading it.
I am pleased to announce to you that as part of efforts to bring the diplomatic relations between the GIANT OF AFRICA and the xenophobic South Africa to a very low ebb, the federal government of Nigeria under the leadership of Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that the activities ofNigeria Air, Africa’s best and largest air transport company, to South Africa will be suspended totally. We cannot joke any longer with the lives of our people as we did during the 16 years of PDP misrule.
Although the date of the commencement of this suspension is not known yet, the foreign affairs minister will soon shed more light on that. It is rumoured that the government may also be considering deporting the millions of South Africans in Nigeria for a better life or seize exporting the many life-changing technology and products we currently send to the SA.
The South African high commissioner to Nigeria said categorically that no Nigerian was killed, and I was tempted to ask our minister if he has the exact figure of Nigerians in South Africa. Another minister in the cabinet of Ramaphosa claimed Nigerians came to their country and took their jobs. Like how? Nigerians? Your jobs? We don’t have an unemployment problem in my countrynow. The Buhari-led FG kept to their promise and provided jobs for graduates. During the last recruitment into the CBN, were you not employed? NNPC, didn’t they employ you? What about the Federal Civil Service? Just name it, the government has created millions of jobs for the lazy youth.
I heard there are basic amenities in South Africa for their citizens, who told these people we don’t have access to these amenities too in Nigeria? A fresh graduate in my country is entitled to an apartment by the government, enjoys good roads, pipe-borne water, constant power supply and so on. Why then are we in South Africa? The same reason my president will frequent UK hospitals at the expense of the sophisticated world-class hospital we have in the country.
Air Peace has volunteered to bring other Nigerians that escaped death in South Africa back to Nigeria. After all, it’s more honourable for a man to die in his land than die in a foreign land. It would be a shame if our government folds its arm and allow foreign governments kill its citizens. Come back home and enjoy life in the hands of Fulani herdsmen, SARS, Boko Haram, Kidnappers, Ritualists, (un)biased Judiciary, (in)efficient legislators and so on.
Although Buhari is to travel to South Africa by October, this is to get firsthand information of the whole issue since the special envoy he sent may not have done the needful. It also presents an opportunity for him to think of further stringent measures to be taken in order to deal with them."
Five (scientifically proven) ways to becoming a patriotic Nigerian,https://punocracy.com/five-scientifically-proven-ways-to-becoming-a-patriotic-nigerian/,2019-09-06T08:13:23+01:00,"Researchers from the Kilimanjaro Institute of Social Development, and Exaggerated Living (KISDEL), Nigerian Patterned Behaviour (NPB) department, have come out with a listing of top five traits that patriotic Nigerians show everywhere across the world.
This list was curated after a deep study of the behaviour of one thousand Nigerians in Isolated Research Labs (IRL), and five million Nigerians in the open concentration camp which we named Life Among God’s Own (prime) Sufferers (L.A.G.O.S).
The well researched list to being a patriotic Nigerian goes thus:
1. Only a Nigerian can kill a Nigerian
Our school of Psychopathic Behaviour has successfully proven with evidence from the six geo-political zones in Nigeria that Nigerians enjoy a psychological state which makes them furious when the death of Nigerians come from anywhere else that is not Nigeria.
The school references killings in Jos, Benue, on Nigerian Highways, in Biafran territories, in Kaduna, and other parts of the country which are being perpetrated by Nigerians in Nigeria, as evidence that population control (fancy word for genocide) of Nigerian citizens is a concern of Nigerians alone.
The school further mentions how Nigerians unite regardless of what zone you’re from, to condemn the killing of Nigerians in South Africa, attack on Nigerians in Ghana, and in other places. Thus, to prove your patriotism as a Nigerian, you must be willing to fight for the monopoly of killing other Nigerians.
2. Be selective in your anger
In 1997, during the reign of Nigeria’s most powerful dictator, Gen. Sanni Abacha, Nigerians found the most potent coping mechanism anywhere in the world. Tagged the biggest shock absorber, Nigerians found God in a domesticated fashion. The domestication of the Nigerian God also came with a virtue which has become the Nigerian identity; selective anger.
Because of the relationship Nigerians have with God, Nigerians have grown to leave basic things like embezzlement, nepotism, and other forms of humongous crimes for God to judge, then protest against LGBTQ, cross dressers, and other queer people. There’s a saying that a Nigerian’s anger only lasts a twitter trend.
If you want to be balanced in your world view about everything, you’re not ready to be Nigerian. Say, for instance, if someone uses nepotism and it doesn’t favour you, you point a finger and accuse them of tribalism. But when it favours you, the anger melts, and you call such favouritism “connection”. A patriotic Nigerian is never balanced.
3. An angry Nigerian hurts another angry Nigerian
As we’ve established that Nigerians are capitalists in the business of killing Nigerians, so are they monopolistic in hurting Nigerians especially when they’re angry. A Nigerian angry at the government for insufficient jobs will beat up another Nigerian to get his next food. Well, you may argue that this happens everywhere, but what is not ubiquitous is that a truly patriotic Nigerian, especially at times of cross-border anger, must hurt another Nigerian to tell people in other countries that Nigerians want them to stop hurting Nigerians.
4. Institutionalized suffering
Our school of Advanced Sciences and Technological Adaptation (ASTA), in a research conducted on three areas; A) Ease of using tech B) Using tech to reduce workload C) Automation, AI & 4th industrial revolution in Nigerian workplaces, discovered the most deeply rooted sociological addiction of Nigerians; suffering.
Nigerians are modelled to believe in hard work over smart work. Nigerians enjoy sweating for money, over chilling for money. This is enmeshed into common Nigerian dictum like “No pain no gain”, “no food for lazy man”, “no sweat no gain”. In government offices, it is commonplace to see Secretaries forwarding letters, applications, and requests that can be done with computers, being done manually. Also, in tertiary institutions, admission registration and clearances that can be processed on the internet would rather acknowledge a sweaty Nigerian.
This sweat and live style of living is so Nigerian, that anybody who is seen living fine in Nigeria without a known backstory full of pain, suffering, and sweat, is definitely a criminal.
5. Giant of Africa reminder
Even as Nigeria continues to trail in Economic advancements, technological developments, food production, and basically everything else, Nigerians are never found wanting in reminding the world that they are the Giants of Africa. In terms of population, Nigerians are like roaches; they keep multiplying in numbers, spreading everywhere across the world. And that is just enough to be the giant of Africa; population.
It is unimportant that countries like Mauritania, Rwanda, and even Ghana, are beating Nigeria in certain economies, because as a Nigerian philosopher Mr. VIC-O has rightly said, “if you don’t believe in yourself, who will believe for you? Nobody mehn. That’s the truth about it. You’ve to believe in yourself because you know you can do it. You turn impossibility to possible.”
Conclusively
The KISDEL continues to work on more behaviours that are peculiar to Nigerians, and will update the list as soon as we have more evidence for uniquely Nigerian behaviour. Our researchers work around the clock, and will continue to do what’s best for the Nigerian people from our labs across Kilimanjaro."

﻿﻿Mama Nigeria is a xenophile. She reveres foreigners and welcomes them in open arms. She even goes ahead in giving the foreigner a better treatment than her own children, who were not deserving of any welcome because they had been with her. The return of the biblical prodigal son treatment is a privilege enjoyed by foreigners, while actual Nigerians are embodiments of the first son character.
—The son who goes to his father disappointed and bittered voicing out a rage long bottled, “I’ve been with you all this while, and yet you’ve never killed a fattened cow for me.” Like the father, Mama gives deaf ears.
This explains why foreigners head our construction teams, our bakeries, our football teams, and basically everything that catches the foreigner’s fancy in Nigeria. It is not because there is no better native to do the job, but Mama sees a foreign skin and immediately forgets the competence of her children.
Nigerians, tired of the ill-treatment from one who is supposedly their mother but doesn’t act like it, elope. They abscond hoping to get haven from other mothers. They try Mrs United States, Mrs South Africa, Mrs Lybia etc. with the mindset that since their own mother was so kind to foreigners, they too would be welcomed in open arms.
How wrong they were.
They failed to realise that their mother missed all her
antenatal classes where she should’ve been taught about caring for her children
as a priority, and these other mothers had a flawless attendance and even did
extra courses for extra credit, and so cared deeply about their children over
anyone whoever it may be.
Nigerians get a feel of the memo when their feet become sore from the run-around involved in obtaining entry to the new mother’s home. Some give up halfway and return to Nigeria, others try sneaking but are later caught and kicked out or worst killed.
The so-called lucky ones who are granted entry become celebrated by their siblings at home, but they themselves know that the reception given them by their new mother and siblings is not worth celebrating, but they smile for the gram and send pictures suggesting comfortableness. But are they?
When every morning features a condescending reminder by Mrs New Mother that they do not belong here, when the freebies enjoyed by their new siblings only come to them when it’s spoilt or leftover, when they are forced to marry their new siblings if they want to remain because Mrs New Mother is obsessed with her nationality, when their backs have turned passage that their new mother and siblings tread and so are always to the ground, when to go on living means sniffing the bum of their new mother and feigning enthusiasm?
But they are Nigerians whom years of ill-treatment have left in them a single positive trait, survival. So within the confines of a home that loathes them and a reminder that home is still Nigeria – the madhouse they ran away from, the one where weeks before they absconded, things had deteriorated to the point where siblings were killing siblings — they grind till grace, they strive till they thrive ignoring the derogatory remarks they get at the turn of each day. “Go back home to your mother, you outsider” or the harassments that come from their new uniformed siblings that care no less about their legal entry and treat them like savages.
Every day they ask, “Why is mama different? Why does she love my new siblings back at home, and I’m hated here? Why does mother hate me? Why does my new mother hate me?” and somehow they know that no replies would come. Years of unanswered questions have taught them to swallow pain, rage, and turn it to a power surge that spurs them to action.
Amidst all odds, they begin to make sense out of their
living. They find out that their new home even though foreign has basically all
the utensils they need to cook, that unlike Mama’s workshop that only has two
sets of working tools, this one has several boxes. While they rummage the tools
to find the best spanner to tighten their lives, they come across many that are
identical to Mama’s, then they ask, “Does Mama feed these people and give
them our tools as well?” another question they know no answer would come
for.
At last, they find the best, one that fits just right. About tightening, Mrs New Mother walks in. Condescendingly she asks in mock-concern, “Do you even know what those are?” Before giving them the opportunity to explain themselves, she bursts out laughing and leaves them to the tools. A stereotypical and prejudiced treatment they’ve gotten used to. At home it is Mama not appreciating their worth, here is Mrs New mother not knowing it. Either way, you don’t put Nigerians in a paddleless boat suspended in the middle of a sea and think they will drown, they will float it to shore for sure, there is so much the hands can do, they are that innovative. It is innate.
They pick up the tools and begin work. They tighten their
ankles, their wrists and waists, several moons after, their pockets are tight,
their shoulders no longer slouch, they’ve become resistant to the stinky bum of
Mrs New Mother and no longer smack. They have now turned content, too content
much to Mrs New Mother’s chagrin. So she begins another agenda.
“Why are these people happy? Why are my foster children more successful than my biological ones? They must go back. I do not want them anymore. They must go”
Envy turns into and because she is no Nigeria, she comes for
the little ones of the Nigerians first, sets her children to torch them, then
slowly advances to the adults, killing them one by one and advises her children
to gloat.
“Go! If you do not want to die” Mrs New Mother
charges.
This is no middle of the sea, neither is there a paddleless boat anywhere. Nigerians are sitting on a fence made of wood, between hell and purgatory and both flames are sure to engulf them. Come home and die in the hands of Mama and her siblings or remain and die in the hands of Mrs New Mother and foster siblings.
“Home is a sorry state. Abroad, lethal. The problem is
being Nigerian.”

Becoming a Nigerian politician: The ‘Wadume’ Model,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-nigerian-politician-the-wadume-model/,2019-09-06T07:21:17+01:00,"By:Godswill Gwanzwang Elisha
INTRODUCTION
Are you a Nigerian? Are you young, agile and a number in the teeming population of Nigeria’s unemployed youth? Do you aspire to hold a political post in the country that prides itself as the giant of Africa? Do you seek refuge from the kidnapping propensity of the Nigerian Police Force’ Kidnap Squad? Do you want your Army Captain friend to kill your abductors? Thank Providence for placing you in the right country and making you read this at the right time. Herein are four easy steps to achieve your political goals.
MODULE I: SELL FISH!
To be a Nigerian politician, local man must learn to
start small. Somebody shout Hallelujah! The other day I heard a pastor preach
to his congregation on the imperative of starting small and how it is
abominable to despise humble beginnings. He cited a Bible verse to drive home
his point.
Do you still remember Wadume? That renowned Nigerian
politician on whose account some gallant Nigerian soldiers decimated the
Nigerian Police Force Kidnap Squad. Hamisu Bala of Ibi town, Taraba state. Just
so you know, he started small by selling crayfish not worth more than a
thousand naira. He later upgraded to fish, properly so called, worth about five
thousand naira. He emptied himself into his trade and exhibited the highest
degree of propriety, diligence and fairness in his business. Heaven could not
overlook him. He forced the hands of Divinity to do something. So, beyond human
comprehension, Heaven opened one of its windows and threw upon Wadume the
goody-bag of riches.
If he had been idle, there would have been nothing for him to rely upon in stating his case before the court of the Almighty, who is a just and the sole giver of wealth. You too should start small. Sell crayfish. Upgrade to fish.Boom!Your wealth has come.
MODULE II: NOW THAT YOU HAVE IT, FLAUNT IT!
What good is having money if you can’t spend it?Wu
den d moni epp?
Now that you have the money, proceed on pilgrimage to Jerusalem or Mecca in thanksgiving to your maker. To show that you have arrived, travel first class, talk first class and wear first class. Never contemplate prayer and fasting while there, you have made it in life. Any pious act now is like campaign after election. Upon completion of the pilgrimage, the next thing is to marry, and if you have a spouse already, add to the number. But before that, remember to add the honorific of JP or Alhaji before or after your name, don’t mind making it your middle name.
You need no telling that after long years of
servicing you in all the rooms and compartments in your house, madam is worn
out. Her skin now competes with the agama’s, and her tanned skin is a complete
opposite of how she came into your life. Her lips have thickened and have been
rendered unsuitable for a passionate conversation of the lips. Her once
graceful nubile frame has long given way for a tube-like edifice constituting
nuisance in your newly acquired mansion. The idea of being romantic or giving
it to you in other versions other than the version exported to us by the
missionary is lost somewhere in oblivion. Your justification for adding another
needs not be stressed. She is now below your standard. Add a fat one. Follow up
the fat one with a slim one. Tola should join them as the tall one. What of a
short one? Miss not the pleasure they can bring to your bed.
Be not contented with being a local champion; buy a
house close to government house, buy a house or more in every major city of the
country. Never stay at home for longer than a week except on special occasions.
Form busy for everyone including your newly purchased wives, after all, if your
money cannot buy you true love it can at least buy you many more mistresses.
If you have a problem, spend money; if you encounter a hitch in solving the problem, spend some more. Spend, seriously spend and spend more money on man till your money bails you out.
MODULE III: BUY THE BOYZ AND THE BIG BOYZ!
As earlier stated, start small. To succeed you need
to have boyz and big boyz on your side. Before buying the big boyz, start small
by buying the boyz first. How do you do this?
You don’t have to go far. Enter a gaming shop and
give “dem boyz” money to play game with. Go to the holy of the holies of the
community and deliver truckload of weed to the parishioners of that cathedral,
crimson their eyes with your gift. I bet you it will prove a masterstroke
during election. Go toMaishayiand settle everyone’s tea and noodles.
Extend your benevolence to the beer parlours and football viewing centres. In
all your doings, share money.
Get your boys to carry your gospel to every nook and cranny of the locality, especially within a hearing distance of the Big Boyz. Make efforts to draw close to the big boyz. Visit your traditional ruler, when leaving drop some car keys for him and his entourage. The royal blessing that would follow should see you through difficult times. Chieftaincy title may chase you home.
Hang out with politicians and finance their political ambitions. A child in a crowd needs the shoulder of an adult to see what is taking place in the front. Expect them to return the gesture someday.
Your next stop should be the police. Pay them more
than the usual fifty naira; allow brown envelopes to reach their postal
addresses freely.
If the police prove too trust-worthy for your liking,
close their chapter, it is time to aim for the army. Make a field marshal your
friend, if this proves difficult, don’t go below a captain
If you have done the above in addition to what I
posited in the preceding modules, be proud of yourself, you are now almost a
Nigerian politician.
MODULE IV: NEVER KIDNAP, CONTEST FOR POWER!
With your divine wealth, classes of wives, mansions,
cars, boyz and big boyz at your disposal, do not contemplate kidnapping for ransom
or some shit that some people do these days for money. Let’s get the records
right, Wadume never did these kidnapping stuffs. He has said this on several
occasions. He sold his fish well and the heavens took pity on him and bestowed
wealth on him.
Form a political party or join one, on that platform,
contest for election. Ginger your boyz and big boyz to go to the polls and send
“Say Baba” back to his infertile cows in Daura or whereverrugathey may
be grazing. Call yourselfMai Kyauta– the generous one – and promise
that your generosity will reach the pockets of the citizenry. Promise them what
you do not intend to provide for them (Are they not ever gullible?), even if
you fail at the polls, don’t worry; you are now a Nigerian Politician.
Brandish your new identity as a politician. It explains the source of your wealth. It qualifies you for chieftaincy titles and juicy political appointments. Should those untrustworthy policemen betray you and kidnap you, your boyz and big boyz will alert your friends in the army who will annihilate the Police Kidnap Squad.
CONCLUSION
Knowledge, they say is power. Now that you have been
empowered, do not fail to act on it. Your breakthrough is around the corner. I
look forward to reading your success stories.

Olayinka restores UI Students’ Union after T-warm’s wedding,https://punocracy.com/olayinka-restores-ui-students-union-after-t-warms-wedding/,2019-09-05T23:18:13+01:00,"The Vice Chancellor General (VC-G) of the University of Ibadan, Prof. Idowu Olayinka Able has finally restored the university’s Students’ Union after he was sure that T-warm, a former students’ union president, has finally gotten married.
The restoration was contained in a press release written and posted by the VC-G on his personal Facebook timeline which has recently been converted to the official bulletin of the university.
Olayinka also assured the students of the university not to worry about the smart I.D cards he had promised them over 2 years ago as they (the smart cards) are currently being produced in his dream.
Recall that the university senate led by VC-G Olayinka had suspended the Students’ Union and rusticated its student leaders in 2017 following  a protest led by the then Students’ Union president known as Comrade Beardless, over the non-issuance of identity cards and other issues we can’t recollect at the moment.
It should be noted that VC-G Olayinka had also advised T-warm, who was busy at the time acting supporting-striker-activist to the student leaders, to go and get married which he finally did few weeks ago.
“After seeing
T-warm’s wedding picture on Facebook, I was finally convinced that the young
man had yielded to my fatherly advice eventually and because of that, I ordered
the university senate to lift the ban placed on the students’ union,” he wrote.
“Now that all the political former students’ union leaders are married, it is the best time to bring back the Union. By the time their wives start asking them for money and they start having to cater for their kids, they won’t be available to lead or incite protests anymore.
“In fact my
decision to restore the Union at a time I am sure T-warm will be in honeymoon
was to ensure he won’t be around to mentor the young ones or influence them in
any bad way.”
Meanwhile,  when a student posted a comment asking about the production of the promised smart ID cards which played a major role in the crisis that led to the initial ban, Olayinka replied, “Yes work has begun on it, because the cards have to be smart, we started with design thinking approaches which took us about two years to decide whether they should be made of plastic or made of steel… you know… and we also spent another 5 months deciding whether it should be circular in shape or rectangular or triangular…which was particularly inspired by what we want our students to be.
“But eventually while in my dreams some days ago, the Lord revealed to me how it should look like ⁠— triangular! So, right there, in my dream, I gave the workers go ahead with the designing and as I am typing this comment, thousands of workers are already working day and night to ensure that the smart card prototype will be ready before I will hand over the dream baton to my successor.
“With the current state of insecurity on campus, we also want to ensure the cards must be able to identify and arrest a thief all by itself! Isn’t that ingenious? That will go a long way in keeping the campus safe, therefore it may take longer before the first prototype comes out and I am particularly happy that my successor will be the lucky man to deliver this great dream of mine,” he added.
As the administration of the VC-G Olayinka comes to an end, many have argued that the major reason for bringing the SU back is to transfer the burden of campus (in)security to them just as he had previously suggested using the male students as a human shield in protecting their female counterparts.
On the other hand, there’s also rumour that the pressure is coming from the International Alumni Body who is making Mr. Able to choose between a handsome grant and the insistence of no Students’ Union.
In response to another comment posted asking whether the rusticated leaders will also be recalled, VC-G Olayinka replied, “First things first, has he grown beards? I am still strongly allergic to discussing sensitive university issues with a beardless student. And number two, has he withdrawn his pitiable case from the court? The boy lacks respect! If he were to have a misunderstanding with his father, would he have sued his father to court? Answer me now? The issues are simple, he must grow his beards or get an artificial beard, whatever…he must withdraw that case against me from the court and he must come down to prostrate to me at the new Ayo Banjo’s manor. Simple!”
A member of the
senate who pleaded anonymity told us in a private chat that “we are tired
of fighting these thieves alone, it is better we bring back the Students’ Union
to confront these thieves. Youth versus youth, it will be a case of TWO fighting.
STUDENTS WILL SOON START BLAMING THEIR UNION LEADERS FOR INSECURITY RATHER THAN
WE, THE MANAGEMENT…and that, the senate concluded in its wisdom, will be better
for the university’s reputation, home and abroad.”"
"Prayer is the key, Prayer is the master key.",https://punocracy.com/prayer-is-the-key-prayer-is-the-master-key/,2019-09-05T16:11:48+01:00,"Are you a Nigerian? Are you a Christian, Muslim, traditional worshiper  ati be be lo? Do you believe in the power of prayers? Do you believe in the power of your god to do magnificent wonders? Then you have come to the right place. This article is for you. Be you politician, kidnapper, fraudster, lazy Nigerian youth…; it is important that you recognise that faith in your god is an important component of your everyday life. He  hears your cries, he sees your plight and surely, he will answer your  prayers.
Now, as a Nigerian who worships one of the gods Nigerians pray to, when you hear reports of kidnappings on the news, first you pray to your god that it never happens to you and your loved ones, then you pray for the safe recovery of the kidnap victims with or without ranson. It does not matter that your country has a Police Force dedicated to combating crime, you; just pray to your god that he grants them his divine wisdom and guidance to enable them crack the case. Your prayers will definitely go a long way in making up for their lack of training and investigative skills which they so desperately need to investigate criminal activities in the country.
Is SARS harassing you and brutalising you as a Nigerian even though you  have a justifiable means of income? Are they labeling you a fraudster  because you have a laptop in your backpack? Are they threatening you  with false imprisonment? Fear not, maintain your philosophical calmness  and pray. Pray to your god that just like Peter in the Acts of apostles, your god will send his Angel to set you free from detention.  Afterall,  prayer is the key; it is the master key, and it opens every door, but only if you believe. So my brother, Praayy!
Are your countrymen being oppressed and persecuted in foreign lands? Are they being clubbed to death and their businesses looted? Pray. Are they being  auctioned off as slaves? My brother, I say pray. Pray for their safety  and well being, pray against every devilish spirit of xenophobia, the kind that has gripped them in the South of Africa. Never mind that your leaders are seemingly clueless, and that your President is picking his teeth while your country burns, pray. Pray that your god should imbue him with the wisdom and the understanding he needs but appears to be lacking to steer the affairs of your nation. It is no secret that his cluelessness is the work of his enemies. You know them. Those ones he democratically wrested power away from four years ago. Despite their crushing defeat at the polls, still they bedevil his government. Pray that your god confound their activities and send down his divine fire or whichever instrument of destruction he prefers; to consume them.
Pray without ceasing, but if you must cease, pray without reasoning. Because you have faith, everything will work for your good and all your problems will disappear once your take them to your god in prayer. You will not even need to lift a finger before you behold his marvelous wonder. Afterall, your god does works in mysterious ways.
In conclusion brethren, I urge you to pray. Pray in all that you do that you do not become a victim of Nigeria’sanyhowness.
Do this as often as you will, and all will be well with you.
Shalom."

The apostle’s letter to Nigerians in SA,https://punocracy.com/the-apostles-letter-to-nigerians-in-sa/,2019-09-05T06:38:20+01:00,"By: Francis Olamide
1. Greetings from the brethren in your native country, Nigeria. Your well-meaning brothers here still think we’re giant of Africa, they say so after gulping few bottles of mediocrity; especially when their oppressors commission a borehole as a constituency project five streets before theirs. Brethren, we’re the GAUNT of Africa. I’m sorry for how the people of SA have treated you. If not that your country is booming, you won’t be in such mess.
2. We never saw this coming. You know this has never happened until days ago. No Nigerian has ever been beaten, molested or robbed in SA—this is the first time. That’s why we are slow at reacting. All those former news we heard of the inhumane acts towards you in SA is mere talk. It wasn’t real, that’s why it’s taken us so long.
3. In the last election, we warned your brothers here to choose competence over incompetence, but they preferred a saint in Buhari form; he was the new Angel Gabriel God sent to wash Nigeria free of corrupt people like he did in his first spells as a military dictator and civilian. I’m sure they’re very much happy with that decision especially how it has reduced the price of crude oil, foodstuffs, and cost of living. We have recently been sentenced to eating the best rice in Africa; you know those ones with plenty stonesnah. Let’s leave food and talk about you.
4. I know you left Nigeria because the land was flowing with surplus milk, honey and seasoning; you had to export some of that enjoyment for SA people to enjoy with you. After all, there’s love in sharing. Taste and see that Nigeria is blossoming.
5. You forgot that stepping out of Nigeria carries a lot of benefits; like the way SA people are currently pampering you, swift intervention from your native country when you call them and how the FGN will deal with whoever disrespects you as a Nigerian.
6. Don’t panic, my brother. Aid is coming in the form of condolence visit; fortunately, the aid is coming so swiftly it’ll take two days before it will arrive. The government your brothers voted into power are very good at sympathizing with others. Over here, the ministry of condolence and sympathy is headed by no less than the VP. It costs so much to nip problems from the bud so it’s best to deal with them when they reach our doorstep.
7. In fact, Nigerians didn’t have to talk much before Baba took action by sending a delegate to SA. I believe those delegates will pay your hospital bills, raise the dead victims and compensate for your losses, isn’t it?
8. Guess what? Your fellow brothers have been reacting here; they want to close down all South Africa owned businesses—from Shoprite to MTN; Multichoice to Stanbic; Spar to other companies owned by SA people.
9. I tried to warn them of the consequences. Where will Nigerians watch their favourite EPL games? On NTA ch. 10 blurry transmissionabi? Where will they see BB9ja? African magic? The Foreign Affairs ministry carries a lot of power that their bargaining power in the international community has reduced, overpowerdehworry them. I told your brothers that peacefully loot various Shoprite outlets that SA has everything to lose since our surplus manufacturing industry has made SA depend so much on us.
10. Let me stop here. The entire synagogue of Nigerians greets you. Till the condolence train of the FG arrives, stay safe."
Macpherson Farm,https://punocracy.com/macpherson-farm/,2019-09-04T07:09:50+01:00,"By: Tekena Charles Banigo IV
(A story from the lost books of George Orwell)
Of all the farms whose animals had rebelled against their oppressive human owners (just as Old Major had desired for the beasts of every land and clime), few were predicted to have a future as bright and prosperous as the Macpherson Farm. And it was easy to see why. It (the Macpherson Farm) was a beautiful haven said to rival even the historic Eden.[1]The lush trees in its bountiful orchards produced succulent exotic fruits all year round. Its vast green fields yielded grains of the finest quality. And its woods provided timber, the like of which had not been seen since the days of the human king named Solomon. It was the pride of every animal.
Of all the farms who’d been tipped for success, none had their fortunes take a turn as disastrous and unfortunate as the Macpherson Farm.
For a few years after their rebellion, everything had worked out just fine. Progress was steady and it was only a matter of time before they caught up to and even surpassed the lazy humans. Then all of a sudden, in a series of events mirroring those which brought the old Manor Farm to ruin, things began to go awry. And not a single facet of their existence was spared the rot.
A good example of this was the area of internal farm security. The German Shepherds who were once the best guard dogs had over time become one of the most corrupt and inept organizations on the farm. So although they were the first line of security, they were always the first to flee whenever wolves came raiding. After this brazen act of cowardice, they would proceed to capture innocent sheep, dress them in wolf skin and parade them as captured wolves! A good number of them even went as far as being on the payroll of the criminal wolves and foxes. It was indeed a puzzling situation which would have been quite the comedy if the consequences weren’t so calamitous. Humans and neighbouring animals would occasionally peep through the fences of the farm, witness the generally deplorable state of affairs and together, ask the same questions. “How did things come to be this way?” “How did the once glorious Macpherson Farm suddenly find itself struggling with basic issues such as food production, health and security?” The answers to these questions lay in the actions and choices of the principal actors in this Greek tragedy – the animals themselves.
Now, as you must have rightly guessed, the Macpherson Farm was one of the largest and most populated in the region it was located. Virtually every type of farm animal inhabited its grounds but the most populous were the cows, goats, and chickens.
The cows (who were the largest group) believed they were superior to everyone and as such, vested with the divine right to rule the farm. The bitter irony was that they were, in fact, the poorest among all animals and often begged for scraps from the same goats and chickens they looked down on. Despite their pathetic state, however, they preferred to die in penury rather than see any other animal wield political power on the farm. And so every election cycle, they threw their weight behind their ruling class who impoverished them in the first place.[2]
The goats claimed to be the most intellectually advanced and exposed of all the animals. The simple truth, however, was that many of them were a most insular lot who had never left the confines of their pen. It showed in the way they always assumed any animal on the farm which was neither a cow nor a goat was automatically a chicken! They would stubbornly argue and go on to address fishes, ducks, and sheep as chickens despite their protests that they were totally different animals. In retaliation, said animals would point out that for all their supposed advancement, their internal political system was almost entirely controlled by a wily old billy goat known as Bourdillon.
Last, but not least, were the chickens. They claimed to be discriminated against by the cows and goats but went on to discriminate against the fish and rabbits who were not as populous as they were. Even fellow chickens were not spared as they often argued bitterly amongst themselves which breed was most superior. Their actions, by and large, were a true masterclass in hypocrisy.
With the animals divided by petty differences, they could never unite to oppose the true enemies of the farm – the greedy ruling class who stoked these differences for political gain. In order to ensure they remained in power, they impoverished the rest of the animals and created a social hierarchy very much like the one at the old Manor Farm. They jealously guarded their ranks, rotating power between themselves and their offspring while creating a fictitious middle-class to give the lower-class animals hope of ascension to the upper-caste. It was a devious ploy, and a very effective one. The most unforgivable evil they committed against the farm though was the installation of a clueless old bull to the position of Farm Consul. In fact, to this day, historians agree that this seemingly innocuous act was the final nail to the coffin of the farm.
The bull’s name was simply Harry, but many
preferred to call him “Bull Harry”. He was a gaunt old beast rendered slow in
speech and thought by age. His stark incompetence was matched only by his
inordinate ambition. Rather than make actual plans for the farm, he preferred
to spend his days, chewing lazily on the cud while sighing on how the farm had
been run to the ground by past Consuls. Whenever he wasn’t lazing around, he
spent his time visiting all the exotic farms and human settlements he’d always
dreamed of visiting since his days as a calf. Of course, such visits were
always disguised as state visits but the animals knew better.
The ruling class who installed him tried to butter up his image to the animals but it was evident he had no redeeming qualities. Rogue bulls trampled the gardens of other animals and were never punished even though it was expressly forbidden. On the other hand, he routinely sent his personal security dogs to hound animals he didn’t like. Official appointments almost always went to cows while he told the goats and chickens to be grateful for the low-level posts he gave them. He had all the flaws of the infamous Comrade Napoleon but possessed none of his brilliance.
In a personal attempt to launder his public image, he hired an array of praise singers to extol all his very visible flaws as virtues while making virtues he lacked seem like evils. His tardiness in attending to matters of state was lauded as patience. His inability to grow wealth was likened to contentment and his disregard for the ten commandments of the Macpherson Farm was hailed as a burning passion for justice. All forms of industry and hard work were discouraged and represented instead as greed and covetousness. And whenever any criticism was directed at his style of “leadership”, it was quickly labelled hate speech and treason. Slowly but surely, the once-great titan among animal farms was brought to its knees.
In the end, when the Grim Reaper hung his cloak over the farm, the humans and animals who’d long observed from other dwellings heaved a sigh of relief. The suffering of the Macpherson Farm had gone on for too long; made more macabre by the fact that its end came at the hands of animals and not the evil humans they’d been warned about. The wise ones who’d long heeded the writing on the wall had emigrated to literal greener pastures to begin life anew. The ones left behind? No one knows whatever happened to them. The Reaper’s cloak had over time, grown into a shroud which cut off the Farm from the rest of the world. Nothing that went in ever came out and the animals learned to stay away from its spectral walls and fences. In time, the rest of the world moved on as memories of the farm faded from popular consciousness. A relic only to be remembered around campfires as a fable from the darkest of ghost stories.

had first roamed freely before Man appeared to enslave them.

Keep the scribed bribe for the bench;
Let them have every penny of the meager money.
Lavish their souls with the pauper’s luxury
And you will see fairness in her glory,
For that’s where justice thrives.
Justice thrives in the lungs of the suburb,
Where bullets are exchanged for millets.
Justice thrives in the pockets of the Cabals
That feed from the mouth of famished Labourers.
Justice thrives in the Rocks of Aso,
Where hungry barbarians devour
Every grain of nourishment in our pots,
And excrete fruitful businesses in the bowel of
woe.
Indeed, justice thrives in the land of
Men who failed to sail through seas
That lead to the heart of peace and
tranquillity.
Justice thrives in the hands of Franchise
Where corny brains fill offices
Through stomach infrastructure and polished
lies.
Justice thrives in the birthplaces of
Ngozi, Haruna, Labake and Bassey,
Where they abhor each other’s smile
With every string of flowing passion.
Indeed, justice thrives here and there;

When you speak of Africa,https://punocracy.com/when-you-speak-of-africa/,2019-09-04T06:53:32+01:00,"By:Jesuferanmi
Igbinigie
It is not pronouncedlay-gus, it islah-ghos. To learn the accurate pronunciation, watch the first twenty or so minutes ofCaptain America: Civil War—a movie which effortlessly portrays the bravery of Nigerians as they stand to watch a scene of seeming overdressed American superheroes and villains shoot at each other recklessly in pursuit of some small, presumably dangerous chemical rather than run for their lives.
Only a few things are wrong about this movie: Nigerians and Africans — in general — are usually naked backward savages whose women only get dressed in time for United Nation’s intervention photoshoots: holding their pallid, undersized, big-eyeballed, scanty haired child(ren) to heighten the sting of the poverty, that, and the fact that buildings in Africa should never be as tall as depicted in this movie because all of Africa is savanna ridden with the overflowing boundaries of the Sahara and Kalahari rooting deeply into the cities so that they are all nothing but sand, mud-walled houses, thatched roofs with doors made of disinherited mats.
Learn the truth, the absolute truth that Gombe State is not in Northern Nigeria — it is far east, from Fox’s TV show,The Resident; a piece of information often misrepresented by local media in Nigeria made utterly possible by the fact that Nigerians do not have maps.
Learn that despite having most of the largest church auditoriums in the world, most Africans worship Coca-Cola bottles falling from helicopters — from the movie,The Gods Must Be Crazy. They also practice voodoo or the unconditionally barbaric juju. They may also worship helicopters, white men, ancestors, animals. This justifies Rudyard Kipling’s “half devil, half child” description of non-American impoverished races. Whenever you need to get your facts about Africa, the ones you speak about, get them from movies.
Know that to be an African is to be a scholar of suffering. So, behind every immigrant, there must be an authentically devastating backstory of surviving the Sahara, the belly of a ship, malaria or even wars. At some point in this immigrant’s life, he/she decided that dying on the way to Europe is way safer than living in burning cities ravaged by tribal wars and unnameable memories of loss.
At this point, in your mind or your enlightening article about Africa, quote several golden lines from Warsan Shire’s “Home”. Also, know that to go to Africa is to be a hero. So, any American who leaves the comforts of a stable society and basic social amenities to an African village to be with people who look like the remnants of a God-disowned race, does so for authentically benevolent reasons. This is the truth. All missionaries were heroes. All colonial masters were blameless. All those who instigated the apartheid were a little less than angels.
“All ugly countries are alike;
each beauty country is beautiful in its own way”
—Leo Tolstoy.
Whenever you are tempted to use the name of an African country or city in your article — do not. Except the country has an exceptionally peculiar vice that cannot be inductively generalised to a continental level. For instance, never use the word “Nigeria” in your title, except it has— in the same statement— corruption, internet fraud, terrorist; never use Rwanda except the purpose of the article is nothing other than resuscitating the absolutely ludicrous turmoil between the Hutu and Tutsi; use South Africa if the exposé is about xenophobia but never apartheid.
Also, never shoot a video about Sudan or South Sudan except it has one or two functional armoured tanks in the background and displaced women, especially displaced women. If you must show a man, he must put on a red cap and dark shades, speak meagre Wakandian accent and smoke a lot while carrying an Ak-47 (this is very important) because that’s all African men are.
Note that whenever you have to portray African women, they should never be too happy (except they are around a white hero, eulogising him in local songs), only men are allowed to be unnecessarily happy. There are only two categories of men who are permitted to be this happy: the young bare-chested boy with a woven straw hat and unusually white teeth, smiling at the camera or the incredibly old man with offensively discoloured, discombobulated teeth. Note that middle-aged men are usually busy with tribal wars, they should rarely be on your cover except you are writing about lingering wars or UN’s intervention in “Africa and other countries”.
Whenever you are to make a documentary in which you have to interview an African living in Africa, never pick one that understands English. This is because the grief of poverty and displacement are too prickly to squash into a language as soft as English, but you may translate whatever is said to English with your proper British accent completely masking the original statement and language. This is permissible because there are no televisions in Africa, so no African is ever going to watch your documentary, except the emigrants.
While on interviews with an African in the diaspora, ask more sophisticated questions, such questions as if there are libraries in Africa? Do not bother yourself with puny details like why African writers exist or for whom they write. You may also ask political questions probing deeply into Nigeria or African’s corrupt electoral system and how it often involves an unbelievably large number of perpetrators at each local government or polling unit; talk about how this differs from the electors of America’s electoral college whose few votes often decide who becomes president and in at least four previous elections has chosen presidents in contrast to the popularity vote. Overlook the sketchy details behind the Russian involvement in the 2016 American elections and the tumultuous occurrences surrounding Boris Johnson’s emergence. How a little more than 1% of the British population decided who was going to be ruler. Note that a corrupt political system is not one where few people decide the elections, it is one that cannot provide the statistics.  Just believe that Africa is a horrible place with unequivocally corrupt leaders as opposed to the immaculate American and British leaders and write about it without any trepidation.
Whenever you write about Africa frequently repeat the word “culture” but in an article about America you should certainly not; because all Americans are uncultured; because culture is how uncivilized societies keep their men and women (mostly women), hostage, while “law” is a thing for civilized societies. You may also repeat “landscape” or “giraffe” or “gorilla” or “endangered species”.
Note that if the title of your article is “The Beauty of Africa”, the cover picture cannot be of a person. It has to be giraffes, elephants, trees, groundnut or any such traditional African cuisine. If you must use a person, it has to be a boy—the afore-mentioned hatted boy holding a stick, leading a group of camels across perfectly undulating desert sand. This has to be at sunset, so that twilight strikes the boy’s face leaving it a silhouette—because your article is about the beautiful things in Africa for which the people do not qualify.
Lastly, it is important to title
your collection of articles or the magazine “Discover Africa” because your
inestimable knowledge of Africa acquired from the libraries Africa does not
have, the movies Africans do not watch, or the schools Africans do not go to,
qualifies you to tell the story of Africa; of all its approximately 2000
languages, its 3000 ethnic groups and 1.2 billion people… perfectly.

Putting an end to xenophobic attacks—Nigerian style!,https://punocracy.com/putting-an-end-to-xenophobic-attacks-nigerian-style/,2019-09-04T06:25:54+01:00,"Are your countrymen victims of violent attacks from citizens of another country simply because they weren’t born inside the same imaginary lines drawn by gold-digging, 19th-century European leaders? Are their shops and belongings burnt to ashes by citizens of a country whose GDP is, ironically, on admission at the ICU and needs every productive activity it can get? Are your brothers and sisters suffering at the hands of fools for the sins of a few—sins which are no reserve of one nationality?
Are your kinsmen judged by the emphases in their accents rather than the decency of their character?Challe, do you find yourselves in a country where the wages of sin (by a stranger) is not simply prosecution or deportation but, as the Book of Romans suggests, outright death?
…Then all your problems have reached a red traffic light (never mind that it’s temporary). Draw your seatbelt as I am about to reveal to you the never-before-tested but trusted ways to magically put an end to that age-old menace called xenophobia—made right here in Nigeria!
First, have shitty embassies. You know, embassies that don’t make noise; embassies that like keeping things lowkey, especially when the ordinary Nigerian is under threat. What is a travel advisory? That strange concept should have no place in your dictionary. Your country already has one of the world’s largest populations and your citizens are everywhere, strutting like they own the planet together with all its continents and crannies. Of course, the last thing you want to do is further amplify your presence with some embassy or high commission that promptly speaks out for its people.
Second, never be caught showing displeasure on camera when you are with their number one citizen. Smile! In fact, let out a carefree laugh or two. Hold hands like true pan-Africans while the corpses of your people are flown back for befitting burials. You have to show maturity and mustn’t be seen transferring aggression. It is, after all, the poor people of one country who are killing and the poor people of another country who are dying. Their president is a nice guy. Hug him,challe. And pat him on the back too for promising to do something about the situation back at home. How generous!
Let the Vice President do all the (roadside) talking, while you do the smiling. Besides, here is a country that imports nearly a quarter of all your oil exports and, automatically, contributes nearly a quarter of all your foreign exchange reserves. How else are people supposed to travel abroad for, say, medical treatments or workshops tailored specifically for local government chairmen? Where are we going to get money to subsidise pilgrimage expenses for the rich folks? Think about it.
You should also consider sending a very “special envoy” to the problematic country. That is, of course, right after setting up a “high-powered” committee to communicate your grievances to the African Union. If there’s one thing xenophobes are afraid of, it is having ministers and special advisers from their victims’ country visiting to “register their displeasure”. If nothing else works, trust me, this is certain to bring an end to the madness. And if it doesn’t, at least the envoy can seize the opportunity to also beg your countrymen to return home and build the country. Plus, hey! Let’s not forget the lucky guys in that delegation also get some estacodes to last them a couple of months. It’s a win for everyone, yeah?
Anyway, if your people say enough is enough and finally take their protest beyond the walls of Facebook and the tree branches of Twitter, make sure your friendly policemen and their friendly (but fire-ready) guns are on ground to maintain order. If that is not enough to restore order, make a scapegoat of one or two of them just to teach them a lesson about how precious life is. By the time someone is gunned down, they’ll know never to try such silly antics again.
Whatever you do, do not suspend diplomatic ties. Do not eject the problematic people’s ambassador to your country. Do not withdraw from events scheduled to be held there. Do not impose economic sanctions. I beg you, touch not their investments. In fact, if your countries have a friendly football match coming up soon, fix additional bilateral friendlies every week after till all becomes well. At this point, you can’t have too many. You can’t afford to get the xenophobes angry. We all know what happens when they get angry.
Let your lackadaisical attitude about the whole situation be so glaring that local men are frustrated into taking law into their own hands and making nice-sounding but irrational decisions. Not all local men are frustrated because of xenophobia though. Your successful and unique failures in other areas of life (e.g. in making sure jobs and good food are out of their reach) can also push them into vandalising and looting, all in the name of protests.
So, please, do not fix your economy. Do not create jobs. Do not improve the standard of living of your people, so that as many of them as possible stay at home with no urge to seek supposedly greener pastures (-turn-graveyards) elsewhere. Give them 1001 reasons why a Canadian passport is the best thing after Agege bread. Do not further develop your country than it already is, you know, because this will only get the xenophobes jealous.
And don’t we all know what happens when the darn xenophobes get jealous?"

Dear O.
The last time I was able to send you a letter
was five months ago when I got shortlisted for a writing prize I couldn’t win
because the winner wins with votes and likes, I hope you remember.
I have written several letters after that but
our Post Office fluctuates like Nigerian electricity. There was a time I went
there they said they’ve closed deliveries outside Nigeria for now. There was a
time they closed down for weeks. But lucky me, As I was returning home today,
an announcement was written on their plank (just like every shop owner does,
announcements are made on planks outside their shops) stating that “letters
outside Nigeria are being now delivered”. I don’t know when that will hibernate
again, so I would be quick and brief.
Last year, the couple of mistakes you made
really infuriated and I was really worried because they cost you your health
and belongings. This letter addresses the little things you will do to avoid
their motif. You know all these things, I know you know them. But the easiness
over there might have slept over your brain to remember them. Please, note
them.
Let me start with your dressing. You can dress properly when you leave there so as to avoid embarrassment from your friends, but once you get to your Stop-over because I know you will surely have a stop-over, you will have to change your dressing.
Maybe you should start wearing that cloth now or maybe you should find one of your long-worn cloths. I don’t know what you will do but you must find an old, not ironed cloth to wear that will depict you like a casual traveller. Your cloth can be normal shirt and trousers, but it would be better if you can get an Ankara, Ankara is perfect. Find a sandal a little bigger than your size that when they see you, they will see you as someone they can give and not someone they can charge higher rates. It was because you dressed properly last year that you paid that much money for you fare. It would be good if you can get a sun cap but it is not that necessary. God may be good to you, your bus might not break down as it did last year but I doubt it.  Commercial busses break down always especially at the middle of the expressway where all you can are just bushes and over-twenty-years-left-unused filling stations. Just bring that sun cap in case your bus breaks down, that will prevent you from getting burned from the scorching sun.
Having done with your dressing, the next thing is where you will pack your luggage. You might not have the privilege of getting a Ghana-must-go bag inside the airport but once you get out of the airport, try to get one that will occupy your luggage. The important thing is that the airline labels or anything that might depict you as a Nigerian outside the country must not be shown or else, you will end up paying for your luggage the same amount you pay as a passenger. If you can’t get a Ghana-must-go, ordinary bags will do. Just make sure they are not new. The bag that was stolen last year was because they saw that airline label on it. Be careful.
Please, keep up with your appearance; don’t end up paying double the money of what other passengers pay. I pray you scape through this part because it is the important part. Nigerian drivers might look dirty, but when it comes to charging fares, their brains work like time. Also, don’t argue your transport fare, if you try to argue, you might end up losing the whole money in your pocket. You won’t even know who took it from you.
When you get inside the bus, these things will prevent you from encountering what you encountered last year, especially what cost you your health. Before you bounce into the bus, buy a pack ofTom-Tomsweet and a nose mask. The sweet will alleviate your suffocation of the inhale of petrol and the mask will mitigate the smell of the engine smoke suffusing inside the bus. It is only in Nigeria that the engine smoke of a commercial bus that ought to be blowing through the Silencer blows beside the driver. Please, don’t forget these two things; don’t let a bus destroy that fresh body of yours. I wish you journey mercies in advance.
Yes, before I forget, come with power banks to charge your phone, three laptop batteries and already ironed clothes. You might not be able to endure what we endure here. They restore our electricity once or twice in a week for a little period of time; you might not be able to stand that. I hope you enjoy your holiday.
I know you would want to buy gifts for people when coming, please don’t buy many things for them o, they would think you are there to make money. They would have forgotten you are also a student; it’s just that you’re on scholarship. I know Jide would want you to buy him some clothes, don’t mind him, just buy him a pair of trousers. That is okay for him. And for others, just buy those sweets you bought last year. That will be okay.
And for me, don’t buy me anything. I will be
glad to see you and that is enough as a gift. Just don’t forget the phone and
the new shirts and trousers you promised me. I also like the type of glasses
you wore last year. I am not telling you to get it for me o, I am just admiring
it.
I will
round up here. Let me quickly go and submit it at the Post Office before they
close down again. I wish you journey mercies in advance again and I hope you
don’t make the mistakes you made last year. I hope this gets to you.
With love,
AAA.

Kudos to our Yahoo boys,https://punocracy.com/kudos-to-our-yahoo-boys/,2019-09-03T06:43:25+01:00,"By: Agbaje Ayomide
This is arguably one of the best times to be a Nigerian, a
very proud one at that. My countrymen, you should know that great feeling.
Well, if you ask me what boosts the morale of the citizenry of a country the
most, I would say it’s nothing than the deserved attention it gets on the
global scene. And this is not in any way far from what we Nigerians are
presently experiencing.
Naija don blow!Seriously, we have been making the big and major headlines in the international media. And you know what that means for us, right? Yeah. Yet again, we are in the global limelight and we are enjoying all that it brings us while it lasts! After all, this is what we have always desired as a nation — to be a leader and be well-known all over the world for a speciality, just as China is well-known for advanced technology. Our country is beginning to bloom and we can only be happy and proud.
Apart from our long and forever-held reputation as the world’s most populous black nation — and in fact, our recently-bagged revered title, the world’s poverty capital — we are now the most renowned and infamous, oh no, famous nation for internet fraud. This our achievement is unrivalled anywhere in the world, we would daresay. And it is only expected that this should somehow give us an utmost sense of incredible accomplishment. And this is just why we have to celebrate it in a grand style, and perhaps acknowledge those who worked tirelessly behind the keyboards and in front of screens to make it possible for us.
I bet you’re mistaken if you think our very good government deserves the commendation for this glorious feat, as it has always been said of our nation’s past notable achievements. Yes, of course, you’re. Don’t even think towards that side at all, at least for now. Or are you not grateful for all the landmarks our leaders have achieved for us so far? They have done enough already; enough is enough. It’s high time we turned the face of recognition elsewhere.
By Jove, if we must give unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar, our hard-working yahoo boys truly own this credit.
In fact, they did a whole lot of work to earn it. And we have to thank them so much. They keep repping us well on the global space by spreading the “419” gospel about us to the rest of the world. Let that even slip for now. To put the over-sugary yet watery icing on the cake, they have added more colourful feathers to the already sparkling cap of our international profile, and as well ushered us to a higher case on the stairs of the global human capital development index. They brought us this much-coveted glory that will endure for so long. And to just say the least, we are so proud of these boys, our very own. They are indeed our true champions and patriots!
If you think this feat was easy to attain by these boys, then you’re just a hater. And you simply don’t know what true hard-work means. And, in case you don’t even know, ‘yahoo yahoo’ is a lucrative and serious job, sorry, business in Nigeria. But you have to strive hard to thrive in the industry. It’s not for the lazy ones. It is one that requires passion, creativity and dedication, and you have to commit yourself to the various arduous processes. Forgot about the unsavoury tales you have heard that yahoo boys are people who don’t want to work. Whether you admit it or not, these our boys are ever-gallant, super-productive and business-minded to the core.
As a matter of fact, they even craft strategic plans and models for the business. They rent apartments — just like warehouses — stocking it, not with goods, but food, other necessary items for sustenance, and purchasing good laptops and smartphones for operational affairs. They also recruit street boys and interested allies, and then train them on how the game works — sourcing for clients, making good use of ‘formats’, forging credentials and sending romantic texts to win over white women, who enjoy having online lovers, to transfer funds on dating apps and sites. And then, they get down to the real work of pressing ‘lapi’ all night.Prapapapa papapa. No stopping. Thanks to the seemingly strong internet connectivity our nights afford in Nigeria. These boys don’t just sleep at all; they stay up grinding and hustling hard, with deft fingers. The business is not a walk in the park at all. And that’s what we are talking about — being hard-working without working hard for money. That’s just the Nigerian way.
However, let’s face it, on a serious and realistic note this time; the stage is no more local, it is now global. Everyone is upping their game to be relevant in this 21st Century. And Nigerians are not to be left behind. Never. If as an entrepreneur in the age, you still think your customer base is in your locality or neighbourhood, then you really need to be updated on the new workings and dynamics of our contemporary world. You have to think local and act global. And if there is ever anyone we are to praise for modelling this noble and incredible path for us, then it is our very own yahoo boys. They have been operating on a global scale; they were never local champions. And they are already subtly showing us where the future is. We are going global as a nation.
It is therefore on this premise that we have our yahoo boys
to thank for the precedence they’ve set for us, for thinking outside the box
and for the glorious dishonour, oh sorry I mean, the honour they have brought
on our country so far. (Pardon my slips so far; my head is just writing faster
than my fingers). We pray we never stop thanking them.
To our dear illustrious yahoo boys, this piece is to recognize your efforts as our stars of the moment. We hail you, from the deepest pit of our hearts.Tuale. Opor opor opor.May you continue to cash-out massively, spend lavishly and display your money ostentatiously. Morewire-wireto your AZA. May your ‘magas’ pay better; may they continue to send you gift cards. May your mouth never dry. May you never be at home when the danger of EFCC and SARS lurks around in gloomy corners, to pay you a courtesy visit. And may you never meet your day of reckoning; it may come and it may not. But, always remember the son of the country’s soil whom you’re and the blackface you bear. Never must you ever forget, even though your profile picture on Hangout, your phone number and the location you’re claiming through VPN show otherwise. You’re still a fucking Nigerian! Scratch that.
On the whole, kudos to you, for being a shining light, beaming our rays forth on the global landscape — this, we will always deeply appreciate you for. Well-done, G-boys! You have started well. And we wish you all the best in your scamming career and as you bring more attention home to us. We are watching. And we just hope you will keep up the good work and continue to make us proud even more. It’s a way to go. Kudos, kudos, kudos!

“Welcome to Diejiria PLC! I’m Nkechi, and I’ll be showing you around!” she squeaked, shaking my arm quickly, furiously, making my entire body quiver in the process. Her grin was so wide that I honestly had to wonder if her cheeks weren’t hurting.
“Thank you,” I said, after
releasing my hand from her monstrous grip, with a mental note to never shake
hands with her again, for fear of metacarpal fracture. “I’m glad to be here.”
I looked up at the building once more; a colossal structure of thirty-six storeys painted in grades of white and green. The colours would have made the place eye-catching in its earlier years but now, the green was washed out to a sallow jade and the whites had almost turned grey. The building’s tinted windows were dusty with abandon and I even espied a few broken ones. Sorry,manybroken windows. The place had looked grander on the website. I sighed.
It seemed somewhere along Nkechi’s bloodline, her ancestors must have crossbred with parrots because the lady couldn’t stop talking, as she led me through the main doors into the building. “Diejiria was established in 1960, and became a public limited company in 1963,” she said in her squeaky-happy voice. “For a long time since the company’s inception, it was run by a series of autonomous CEO’s and directors, until about 1999 when the company began appointing the CEO’s and board members by itself.”
We walked to the elevator as she
went on, and she pressed the button for the top floor as we got in.
“Each floor has a name, and you
should endeavour to know them all while you’re working here,” she said, while
we looked through the transparent elevator doors. It began to move up slowly,
enough for me to ‘enjoy’ the view. “Each floor also has a Closet of Assembly,
as well as a presiding Manager.
“So there are thirty-six managers
here?” I asked.
“Thirty-five. The CEO stays on
the last floor so there’s no need for a manager there.”
“Oh. Okay.”
“This is the Tarada floor,”
Nkechi said as the elevator rose to the first storey. I frowned. This floor had
grass and shrubbery growing through… everywhere. On the walls, the ceiling,
even on the things I assumed to be desks. I was about to ask Nkechi if the
place was abandoned, when I saw a man in a yellowed kaftan emerge from behind a
hedge, holding a sheaf of papers. Our gazes caught for an instant before he
turned away and vanished behind another hedge. I looked at Nkechi, and she
simply shrugged and smiled.
The next couple of floors were
similar in style to the Tarada floor, and several of them had cattle—yes,
actual cattle—ambling about the floors, moving around nonchalantly in the midst
of the busy office workers. A few people shot the cows annoyed stares
momentarily, but quickly went about their business.
“There are cows on every floor,
even the Aduja floor,” Nkechi hastily said, when she noticed the befuddlement
dancing across my face. “The CEO loves them.”
“So he put them onall floors?” I asked, flummoxed. “If
he’s into cows that much, couldn’t he just construct some sort of ranch on the
premises?” Nkechi stopped talking for a bit, but the smile never left her face.
I waited, wondering if she was thinking of what to say, before I eventually got
a little creeped out and faced forward again when the smile still remained. “I
might as well just kill one or two,” I muttered. “Fresh suya.”
“Um, if you value your…job, please don’t do that,” she uttered
quickly, grabbing my arm.
Seeing her barely concealed
agitation, I nodded reluctantly. “Alright. Alright. Tell me how the company
works,” I said, sighing. Then I added, just for her benefit. “And don’t leave
out the juicy stuff. Do that and I’ll kill no cows. Deal?”
Like magic, the glint of fear in
her eyes was replaced by the sharp twinkle of mischief. “Deal.” When she spoke
this time, she sounded freer, no longer like some clockwork parakeet, and I
unconsciously found myself listening intently this time. “Most of the company’s
revenue is generated by the Sour-sour floors,” she began. “The Sour-sour
comprises of the Reevers, Dayelsa, Belta, Cross-Reevers floors and few others,
but these are the major ones involved in most of the company’s revenue. They’re
among the top floors, surpassed only by the Lajos floor and the Aduja floor,
which happens to be the top floor.”
“I see.”
“Yes. Anyway, the company generates massive revenue in every quarter of the year!” Nkechi leaned towards me, close enough for me to get a whiff of the cheap perfume radiating from her alarmingly starched blazer. “Our board of directors are rumoured to be the highest-paid in the world!” she whispered, in a not-so-whispery way.
I recalled the man in the
worn-out kaftan I saw on the Tarada floor, as well as the other employees I saw
on the other floors. None of them looked well paid to me at all. In fact, many
of the employees I saw seemed to be on the verge of madness, malnourishment or
both. “The employees here don’t look well off,” I voiced out.
“Um, well, there isn’t much money
for them,” Nkechi replied.
I did a double-take, and raised an eyebrow. “Uh… didn’t you just imply your board may be the highest paid in the world?”
She shrugged. “You can’t afford
to owethe boardmoney. Exceptions
have to be made.”
I blinked. “Couldn’t you just cut
down some of the board’s earnings so that more money could go round?”
“That was suggested one time,”
she said. “But the board was adamant. There was nothing else the employees could
do.”
“Uh, vote the board members out?”
I said.
“The best option is to pray,” she
said, waving my suggestion away. “We have religious officers on each floor.”
“Howare even these officers paid?”
“By the employees, of course.
Plus, our company’s religious officers have used the payments from the
employees to be among the wealthiest people in the world!”
The more I tried to wrap my mind
around everything Nkechi kept saying, the more baffled I became. I felt like
Alice in Wonderland, or rather, Stunnerland.
“One of the major perks working
here,” she said, eyes lighting up again. “is the sex!”
“What!?”
She nodded quickly, still
grinning. “You can have sex with any member of the opposite sex at any time. As
long as the visitor or employee is up to eleven years of age, work your dong or
your punani to the fullest! Oh, and it’s limited to just members of the
opposite sex. Same-sex relationships within company grounds will get you
suspended for fourteen years.”
By now, I didn’t bother to close
my hanging jaw. I didn’t even process the point of the whole same-sex embargo,
when the age of consent dropped to eleven years on office grounds. That had to
be the lowest consent age in all the world offices. Nkechi simply took my
stupefaction for immense delight.
“Also, if you use your computer
to acquire wealth from other offices worldwide, you will be dismissed and
charged as a fraudster.”
“What?” I blurted. “But what if
it’s legal?”
“Once it involves a foreign company, dear, it can’t be legal,” she said, dismissing my query. “Marijuana is prohibited, but you can do cigarettes. Nicotine is good for your health. No criticising of company policy on social media, and especially do not criticise the CEO under any medium. He is a master magician, and as such, should be accorded due respect.”
“Master magician?”
“Yes. He has the power to make
one unit of Diejiria’s shares equal to a unit of Amerita’s shares. You know
their shares are the global standard of value, right?”
“Is the global stock market in
his backyard?”
“He has the powers to stop office
corruption,” she continued, like I’d said nothing. “the powers to stop office
insurgence and violen—”
A boom sounded, with a tremor
reverberating through the elevator, and I guess, the entire building. Next came
the sounds of what I was certain were firearms.
“Nothing to worry about,” Nkechi
uttered, voice shaky. “They’re simply fireworks.”
That’s when I lost it. “Fireworks!? Those were live rounds! And I’m quite certain,madam, that the boom was an actual bomb! This company does not need me! But do you know what it needs? Let me tell you! First, you need to call Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Doctor Van Helsing! Your company is run by vampires! Two, you need to put a call to hospitals worldwide to supply you with brains from freshly deceased people, because zombies need to eat them to function, and it seems the zombie employees working here haven’t had a supply of brains in a long, long time! Keep your job offer, I’m going to Hanada PLC!”

The Nigerian intellectual guide: 5 random principles,https://punocracy.com/the-nigerian-intellectual-guide-5-random-principles/,2019-09-02T06:48:49+01:00,"By: Favour Olajide
Disclaimer​: Random Noun ‘A roving motion; course without definite direction; lack of rule or method; chance.’
1. As an intellectual, you need to always be armed with dozens of quotes by notable men (and women) in history. There are now mobile apps you can consult. Who knows when you might need them? A stranger might disagree with your opinion that I (the writer of this article) am a better footballer than Messi at Kasali’s football match viewing centre. Boom! You proclaim one of Lee Kuan Yew’s strongest quotes and everyone stays quiet and begins to fear you. “Don’t argue with that guy; the guysabi dieeee.”
2. Cram names of famous people, especially writers. I didn’t say read their works; I said cram their works. I know that with your minuscule attention span, you probably wouldn’t even finish reading this. But don’t worry, once you know who wrote what, you’re covered. The harder-to-pronounce the names are, the better for you. Say ‘Nietzche’. Imagine shouting, ‘according to Nietzche’ while trying to explain how your Camry hit a big man’s Porsche. But start small, with something like ‘Shakespeare’.
3. Learn the ropes of social media and always contribute your one kobo of ideas to every discussion. It doesn’t matter if they are talking about Trinidad and…is it Tobago, or Tobacco? Whatever. Just talk. If people mock your shallow reasoning, console yourself with your intellectual status. The lowlifes have not reached your level of ingenuity yet. Your aim is not really that you become an intellectual; it is that people recognise your intellectualism.
4. Be a fighter. Fight for something, anything. If you like, fight for the rights of Mosquitoes to go about their vampiric business, with their human hosts having a responsibility to not hurt them. It’s free speech. Note the following set of words, I won’t write them twice: radical, fighter, comrade, honourable. Use them to refer to yourself as often as possible with an accompanying-ism. You are an intellectual, you are a fighter.
5. There is no better place to show your intellectualism than as a student at a tertiary institution. Contest elections for the sake of it; campaign using words even incomprehensible to lexicographers; cause trouble. Your intellectual status cannot be any more confirmed than when you and your fellow fighters decry your management’s action and go on to destroy school properties. If you’re eventually punished, you’ve unlocked level 2: martyr status.
In conclusion, if you were able to read up to ‘in conclusion’, I’m sorry for you. You should give up every hope of becoming an intellectual. True intellectuals don’t (need to) read that much.

"Immorality now Nigeria’s greatest security challenge, say police after ‘Operation Risky Bob’",https://punocracy.com/immorality-now-nigerias-greatest-security-challenge-say-police-after-operation-risky-bob/,2019-09-01T08:52:27+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― The Nigeria Police Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, during a press briefing on Saturday declared immorality the greatest form of insecurity facing the country, which is now free of all typical forms of violence and unrest, including terrorism, robberies, kidnappings, and communal clashes.
He explained that this is the background to theinvasionof the birthday of Idris Okuneye, popular crossdresser more commonly known as Bobrisky.
“Now that the country is free from the old forms of insecurity that have distracted us for far too long, we are delighted to announce that our focus has now been shifted to the more important things… you know, like minority sexual orientations and what people do to their bodies,” he said.
“Of course, we would not have achieved this milestone without the help of the Next Level administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, which has promised to raise our salaries by 0.5 per cent in addition to the new minimum wage and also buy new ammunition for our men.
“Er, by ‘new’ I mean guns that are no more than 50 years old,” he added, after a light cough.
“Yesterday’s invasion, which is the first phase of what we’ve tagged ‘Operation Risky Bob’, was no doubt successful as we prevented the commission of ungodly atrocities on our soil. I mean, what insecurity could be greater than not feeling secure with the gender your wise parents gave you?” the PPRO asked, as some policemen and journalists nodded in approval.
“As we enter into this new era of policing, we urge Nigerians to always inform us if they see anything fishy in their environment—such as two consenting adults having sex in a way the govt. doesn’t approve of or naked women dancing in public.”
Mba said the police has decided to relocate its command centre in Borno State to Lagos, which it’s enormous intelligence indicates to be the most immoral, insecure place in the country. “But we’re still waiting for President Buhari to approve this,” he said.
Reliable sources in the Nigeria Police say it’s likely the force will soon be rebranded to suit the new objectives.
“Though we already have a Ministry of Police Affairs, which sorta links policing to ministering, many police chiefs say this is not enough,” one source informed our correspondent.
“Soon, we may have the force rechristened to become ‘God First and God Alone Police of Nigeria’ or the ‘Nigeria Police Force for Good and not for Evil’.”

The lord’s prayer,https://punocracy.com/the-lords-prayer/,2019-09-01T06:45:31+01:00,"By:Abraham
Isaac Oluwatimilehin
The structure was cramped for living and
breathing space. Fumes of frankincense rose into the atmosphere, gallantly
subduing the natural air and suffocating everyone and everything in their path.
The legend “JEOVA SHAMA HOLYGOST FAYA CHAPULL INTANATIONA MINISTRY
HERDQUOTA” was sprawled across the face of a banner, as though written by a
child and attached to the wall of raffia palm behind the makeshift pulpit. But
the building looked nothing like a chapel. Indeed, save for the moth-eaten
wooden benches arranged in a long row and the pulpit and the choking smell of
frankincense and the people of diverse age groups and sex, all on their knees,
the structure might have passed for an abandoned campsite.
But it was a church and I had come to seek some respite from the insanity of the outside world. I had walked in quietly as possible to avoid the prying eyes of other worshippers. Alas! It was to no avail. What seemed like a thousand eyeballs x-rayed my self as I located an empty space to my right on a bench and sat down. A particular woman continued to stare. Her eyes were narrow, awkwardly reminiscent of a bird of prey. The look on her face was a theatrical masterpiece; she had somewhat managed to smile, frown and sneer with a dash of hopeful enthusiasm and a drop of motherly pity, all at once. It was scary and I instinctively closed my eyes and began to mutter under my breath like everyone else around me in a bid to calm my spirit and soothe my soul.
“Brethren, let us pray,” the preacher or pastor or shepherd or whatever pseudonym he had attached to his nomenclature bellowed, his voice reverberating across the whole building in a clear baritone. It reminded me of a certain country musician whose songs were always blaring from the loudspeakers of Abu, a young man who sold pirated copies of whatever audiovisual media anyone desired of him. But this was the house of God and that was the devil’s music I thought, shutting my eyelids so tightly that it hurt. I felt good afterwards. My soul was in need of purging.
“Our father who art in heaven.”
My mind wondered at the thought. God? My
father? A splendid idea that would be. Not only my father but a father to every
person. But I looked nothing like the boy I saw by the roadside, leading a more
elderly fellow by hand or the fat boy back in school, always munching on milky
way candy packs. He never gives me a piece no matter how much I beg him. I
should tell him that he is my brother next time. That would soften his heart. I
hope God performs his fatherly duties to the boys I saw on TV the other day.
They looked like they could do with a good meal or two.
“Hallowed be thy name.”
Not only God, Kamoru also requires of me that I
hallow his name. Whenever I forget to add “Buroda” to his name as
prefix, he strikes my head with his knuckles and reminds me that I was not
present at his naming. It hurts and I yelp like Brutus, Bature’s dog, yelps
when it is kicked for coming close to its owner whenever he is about to enjoy a
meal. I should remember henceforth to hallow a name, especially if I was not
present at the naming of whoever bears it. “Buroda Kamoru, hallowed be thy
name.”
“Thy kingdom come.”
I know that soon, all good people will grow fly
wings and fly up to meet God in the sky after hearing a very loud trumpet or
die and be transported to God’s house in the sky. I want to go to God’s house.
My mother says it is beautiful and I can have my own palace and my own throne
and my own crown adorned with little stars and cute little angels to serve me
as much pancake as I want. I like pancakes. I like God’s house and I want the
trumpet to be blown very soon. If the trumpet won’t be blown soon, I’d rather I
die. It is better there than here.
“Thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.”
They say God’s will always is the best possible for any situation. I hope he has a will for Nigeria. Everyone is now complaining of inflation and a rise in poverty and hardship. Maybe that is God’s will too. Whatever it is, I hope Nigeria turns out the better for it. I love my country and there us much suffering in the land.
Brother Theophilus told my elder brother, John,
that God told him Sister Janet is his will. I overheard them discussing it and
I was mildly amused. How can a person be a will? These things happen though,
God works in mysterious ways. I might have a will too. I wouldn’t mind
Elizabeth. She has nice teeth and a dimpled smile that reminds me of a princess
I once saw on TV. I have to pray hard and shake my head vigorously like Brother
Theophilus does if I want God to make her my will though. I will.
“Give us this day our daily bread.”
I do not like bread. Moreso, I do not like Baba Risika’s stale bread. It smells like something unpleasant, distinct, unlike any other unpleasant smell I know. I understand that a lot of people do not have food to eat and I am supposed to be grateful for what I have. But I hope I still get to make a little choice as regards my meals. Bread and water is not really much of a balanced diet. I might get Kwashiokor. Dear God, give us this day our daily semovita, with vegetable-garnished ogbono soup coupled with stock fish, beef and a chilled keg of palm wine.
“And forgive us our trespasses.”
Forgive me too. I like Alice, Bimpe, Janet and
Tito. I know God does not like that but I am polygamous at heart. I must pray
hard so God can purge me free of dirty thoughts too. Not rotten dirty, bad
dirty thoughts like “Is Muhammad really be God’s prophet” or
“Are the traditionalists actually the right ones” or “What if
the big trumpet does not blow again” ? Rubbish thoughts like that.
Forgive Abu for selling pirated CDs. Forgive that fat kid for never giving me any candy. Forgive Mr Dixon for beating his wife to pulp the other day- it was a horrible sight. Forgive Alamieyeseigha and his co-looters for spending the money meant for 200 million others like their monthly stipend. Forgive us, Lord. Forgive us.
“As we forgive those that trespass against us.”
I really have a lot of people to forgive. I
won’t, not yet. But I promise to think about it. Some wounds don’t heal easily.
Some never do. If I pretend to forgive while I still bear grudges, I will only
be prolonging my healing process. There’s a lot of hurt I have been dealt. I
need to get over them quickly and forgive so I can heal. I promise to try.
“And lead us not into temptation.”
Excellent. Temptation is bad. However, I don’t
understand. God is good. Why would he lead us into temptation? I must be
missing something. I must pray for understanding. I must pray.
“But deliver us from evil.”
Indeed, deliver us. From the cruel hands of
Boko Haram, they’re finishing us off. From corruption, it is eating us up from
the inside, making us rotten and dirty like the measly, small-sized tomatoes
being sold for unbearable prices these days. From thieving politicians, they
are drinking our commonwealth. From the Super Eagles, they’re such an
embarrassment. Deliver us from evil.
Amen! Amen! Amen!

The Nigerian hierarchy of misfortune,https://punocracy.com/the-nigerian-hierarchy-of-misfortune/,2019-09-01T06:45:29+01:00,"By: Eboseremen Bartholomew

Author: Francis Galton, Zooanthropologist
This is an explanatory circular for our white
concerned citizens who desire to visit the country continent of Africa. Specifically,
its poorest most populous tribe, Nigeria.
Hello dear citizen, so you want to visit
Nigeria? Why?
Regardless of your motivations, we commend your
decision to go to the 3rdworld and look forward to your Instagram
post of the starving black child. However, it is our duty to prepare you for
Africa’s most troublesome export – “The Nigerian”. This is because why you must
have heard stories of the elusive Nigerian, to encounter them in the wild is a
very dangerous experience.
The most significant thing to note about
Nigeria which will define your stay is that there is a “Hierarchy of
Misfortune” in Nigeria. This is because Nigeria is a largely unfortunate place
filled with unfortunate people. Some are however more fortunate than others and
typically how unfortunate you are is directly linked to your fortune.
There are three categories of people you are
likely to encounter in Nigeria:
1. The “Dual Citizen” (also known as “The I Just Got Back”)
2. The “Hustler” (also known as “The Clout Chaser” or “The Middle Class”)
3. The “Nigerian Nigerian” (also known as “The Nigerian”)
Disclaimer:
The Nigerian
population neither choose nor are even aware of their positions. In Nigeria,
when referencing the indigenous people in the wild, you should call them by
their name (and pronounce it however you deem fit).
The universal “Nigerian Dream” is to live
abroad and occasionally visit.
Thus, in Nigeria, dual citizenship is a coveted prize and the colour of an individual’s passport has more value than the Naira.
A Dual is a person who may or may not have
multiple passports but isLIVING THE
NIGERIAN DREAM. The trait you must look for in identifying a potential Dual
is the “Presence of a choice” i.e. the Dual can choose
what life to live and where to live it.
The Dual is at the apex predator at the top of
the Nigerian food chain of misfortune. (Note:
They are often vegetarians). He is not Nigerian. Not in the tangible way
that matters. This is because to typically be Nigerian in Nigeria is to akin to
never exhaling. It is to move from one unfortunate circumstance to the other
while striving to be less unfortunate than the person next to you. This is the
“Nigerian Condition”.
But unlike the “Hustler” and the “Nigerian”,
the Dual breathes freely because he can opt out of the Nigerian condition.
This leads to a complex relationship between the Dual and the other groups. He (depending on circumstances) would either pity the “Nigerian” or simply see through him.  He does, however, passionately resent the “Hustler” for their thirsty delusions of mobility (and he may occasionally take advantage of their desire to be a Dual and assign them tasks).
A Dual may be a good or bad person but his most defining quality is his duality. You are more likely to encounter a Dual at your hotel rather than in the wild. Do not be concerned if they are overtly friendly for, they mean you no harm, they just involuntarily cling to anything that is non-Nigerian.
A Dual will often speak with an accent and act in a manner distinct from the other groups. For example, he will engage in activities such as Yoga, Brunch and Game night without any sense of irony. Also, he will sometimes act like as a tourist and frequently express their surprise in the Nigerian condition despite having resided in Nigeria for a long time. A Dual may live in Nigeria but is not subject to the rules that govern the Nigerian condition. For example, despite living in job-barren Nigeria, he will not experience involuntary unemployment because their fathers know someone. So, while he might have to slum it in a 3rdWorld country, he will only ever have 1stworld problems. “Like, this store doesn’t have the juice I like so I have to go to the other store or have it shipped to me”
He is a hypocrite.
For most Duals, if they must exist within the
Nigerian condition, they will thrive by perpetuating the cycle of abuse while
loudly condemning the cycle of abuse during brunch with their fellow Duals. The
Dual is the one you should attempt to limit the majority of your interactions
to as they are the ones you will have most in common with.
The Hustler is the Nigerian who is chasing the
Nigerian Dream and (barely) outrunning the Nigerian Condition. He is in the
middle of the Nigerian food chain of misfortune and because he is aware of his
precarious position on the food chain, he avoids poverty like he avoided human
contact during the Ebola outbreak of 2014.
For the Hustler, God and faith are a means to
an end, (Faith could also be the name of a Dual that he is brainwashing with
his looks to obtain her father’s wealth). He only prays when he applies for a
Canadian Visa or a new job.
He works very hard but does not earn
enough.  He takes Ubers and Taxifys but
is constantly on the lookout for promo codes. He spends but never loses track
of his expenses. He spends a lot of time people-watching on Twitter. He curates
his life on Instagram to imitate the Dual. He has a lot of connections on
LinkedIn.
You will occasionally see him transparently
pretending to be a Dual and in the next moment acting like a Nigerian. You will
also hear him speaking like the Dual when addressing you and sometimes like the
Nigerian with others. Do not be alarmed, the “Hustler” is like a human
chameleon.
He is a hypocrite.
He envies the Dual for living the Nigerian
Dream and so contemptuously mocks them for not understanding the Nigerian
condition. But more than that. He sycophantically befriends the Dual to gain
entry into that world (or he attempts to impregnate Faith).
But above all, He hates the Nigerian. He does
not pity them for their misfortune is their own design. He will often peddle
absurd conspiracies about how beggars secretly have houses and cars to justify
his indifference. After all, not so long ago he was once a Nigerian and now he
is a Hustler.
The Nigerian Nigerian is the Nigerian who has
and will only ever experience the Nigerian Condition. He is at the bottom of
the food chain.
The Nigerian is a disillusioned man who loves his pastor and God (in that order) but hates his fellow man. Prolonged exposure to the Nigerian condition has reduced him to the trinity feelings of numbness, anger and desperation.  He may, however, feel sporadic bursts of joy when his soccer team wins a match.
He lives on less than a cup of Starbucks coffee
a day. His diet consists of escapism and faith.
He is somehow a cynic and an eternal optimist
at the same time.
He is a hypocrite.
He hates the government and complains bitterly
about his life. He rewrites his country’s history and pines for good old days
of military dictatorships. He has strong opinions of things that are not his
concern and will express that opinion loudly, unprovoked, to a group of drunks
at a betting kiosk. He is nameless faceless statistic with High-Blood pressure
who is aware that he is impotent against the forces that govern his life.
Yet for some peculiar reason, the Nigerian is
content and works hard. We theorize that it is because the Nigerian condition
is the only reality he has ever known.
You will often see him in packs. You should be
wary when approaching the Nigerian because while most are tame and will show
the white man deserved adoration, some are desperate and might attack you (your
pockets).  If you wish to trick him into
doing your bidding, you must convince him that what you wish him to do is not
the right thing, but the smart thing (that benefits him and no one else).
The Nigerian man communicates through anger so
do not be shocked to hear constant yelling. He may also speak a foreign
language that seems like English but is not. If you must communicate with him
approach a Hustler to act as an interpreter.
The Nigerian is the most unfortunate and for a
truly unfortunate reason. It is because every day he wakes up, he feels
fortunate. Fortunate to be in his position. Fortunate that he has found a way
to turn survival into a lifestyle. Fortunate that his reward is in heaven. He
feels fortunate to be oppressed.
The Nigerian is the most unfortunate because he
has been tricked into believing that someone else is more unfortunate than he
is.

Solution centre,https://punocracy.com/solution-centre/,2019-08-31T18:43:16+01:00,"By: ABAH, Abah Oyagaba
IT seemed to Jerry within the three minutes of his climbing the in-between-forest mountain, with a cemented stairway and having hundreds of different categories of people clustered like pilgrims on a pedestrian journey, as though the uphill movement to ORI-OKE SOLUTION CENTRE PRAYER GROUND would be endless somehow. His waist pinched him first after he had counted ten stairways behind him, but he was a young man and if old women and crutched men could meander their ways up the hill, he should be braver. Some fellow climbers stepped aside to take some volumes of fresh air. Jerry was young and, so, he shouldn’t join them. Besides, time was ticking out. He must make sure he seats in the first pew to catch his solution quick and unbiased. After leaving not less than thirty stairways and dozens of fellow climbers behind, his waist no longer pinched him; it ached him, but the aching of his waist was nothing to be weighed with his expecting solution.
‘Hi’. Jerry waved at a young lady by his side
whose perfume announced her passage who unlike Jerry and other pilgrims, hid
her desperation in seriousness.
‘Hi’. She replied casually as though there were
other important things to be concerned about.
‘My name is Jeremiah, though people like you call me Jerry.’
‘Good. I am Jessica.’
‘Wow! Nice name; it reminds me of one of my closed course mates back then at the university.’
‘Good.’ Jessica winked.
‘I am going to Solution Centre for an employment opportunity. I have been jobless for more than half a decade. I graduated with 2:1 from UNN. I studied Petrochemical Engineering and as it’s endemic to this our country, I am still roaming Abuja city looking for a job after I had tried PH and Lagos for three years.’
‘Good.’ Jessica replied and Jerry became embarrassed as he quickly realized he had vomited to this Jessica of a lady who is obviously haughty almost everything about himself.
I better leave this lady alone so as to save my remaining rep.Jerry thought and hasted ahead of her though it was already a few meters away from the auditorium.
‘If you’re happy and you know surely that you’re happy and there is no doubt that you’re happy to be in this Ori-Oke this evening to catch your instant solution, can you give the Lord a thunderous shout.’ The chorus leader motivated and the foundation of the auditorium vibrated as the voices of the people filled the air and cumulated into something heavier than abstract.
Everybody sang and danced and rejoiced as the chorus leader had taken them deeper into a different realm. Everybody’s spirit was lighted up and everyone’s face was already aglow. Jerry danced and danced and sang along with the crowd, though at some points he had to move lips so that no one could notice he didn’t know most of the songs.
‘The word of God says we should cast all our burdens on God for He cares for us. Brethren, before we cast our burden on God, we are going to cast our first offering to God. You know, the bible says that it is more blessed to give than to receive.’ The moderator, who Jerry didn’t understand why he chose to keep both beard and mustache at the same time, announced.
Offering song was raised by the choir and Jerry didn’t know when three ques were filed up and everyone was dancing and rejoicing to the offering post. He wanted to follow them, but he quickly remembered he had just his fair back home in his pocket. He looked side left, side right and everywhere, he discovered he was the only one just dancing motionlessly. He quickly remembered back his childhood smartness and the game they used to play during offering time when they had arranged how to rather enjoy the coin they had been given for offering in school the following day. He danced. He swayed his hands in the air rejoicing as he joined the moving brethren for the offering. The que he joined moved until it moved him to the offering box and he played his game well –at least, his right hand went the same direction others’ hands went.
‘It’s time for your solution.’ The moderator announced.
‘Hallelujah!’ The audience chorused.
‘I said, the long-awaited solution time has finally come.’
‘Hal…le…lu…jah…’ The audience was excited.
‘Come on, let somebody give the Lord a shou…t!’ The moderator directed and the mountain sent the people’s voices to the entire Abuja city.
‘Brethren, join me as I humbly make welcome to
the podium the man of anointing. The man of power. The man of authority. The
man of ….’
The audience’s exciting roars interrupted the
moderator. Everybody was agitated at this point. Everyone was twisting here and
there. Jerry had to follow every bit of what was going on whether he understood
it or not.
‘Hallelujah!’ The moderator gathered composure to continue and conclude the introduction.
‘Amen.’ The ‘Amen’ of the audience brought absolute quietness.
‘He is the man of solution…’ The moderator continued.
‘A…me…n!’ The audience jumped up and turned around and demonstrated. Jerry pitied the old people and the crutched people who were trying very hard to be part of the excitement in the auditorium.
‘With a standing ovation and thunderous shouts and applause, join me to welcome to the stage, Pastor, Prophet, Evangelist, Doctor Jeremiah Adebayo.’
The audience roared and shouted and jumped up
and clapped their hands and demonstrated their excitement.
‘Hallelujah somebody!’ The bearded pastor who Jerry doubted if he could be up to forty years began his ministrations of prayers. He spoke calmly and gently and the speakers echoed his voice round the mountain and circulated it around the city.
‘As you know or you should know, I am not the expected solution giver. I am just an errand boy. Baba is on his way coming. But expect your first miracle of solution even right now.’
‘Amen o!’ The audience chorused.
Jerry’s mind was really charged up to receiving his long-awaited miracle. Everybody seemed ready to catch his or her solution as if the solution would be thrown to the audience and only those who were fit would catch it. Jerry was ready to catch his own. After all, he was still a young man. If ten persons in the auditorium would be able to catch their own, he believed he must be among them.
‘As you know, the prayer would be offered batch
by batch as the spirit leads and according to the problems be solved.
The minister called the first group. The group
of those looking for the fruit of the womb. They filed up and were matching to
the podium. Everybody in the auditorium (except those matching to the podium)
was firmly instructed to close his or her eyes in prayers for that was how to
get connected to heaven. Jerry closed his eyes but opened in frequent intervals
though he was really praying. Jerry noticed that those to whom prayers were
offered at that point in time were dropping parcels in a box which he believed
were their respective prayer points that the pastor would anoint and set
ablaze. The group matched back with excitement on their faces.
Wow! So that’s quick
the solutions come. I am really lucky to have come to solution centre today.Jerry thought.
The next group was those looking for husbands. Jerry was shocked as he saw Jessica at the forefront as if she was the one leading the group. Jerry couldn’t believe that as beautiful as Jessica looked, she could be going to prayer houses before having a husband. The procession continued.
It was the turn of Jerry and he went. As he had
seen others in the previous group did before, he folded his prayer point which
he had scribbled on a paper hurriedly as soon as he discovered the need. The
other people in front of him dropped theirs and they were poured ointment on their
heads one after the other. Jerry did same and he became excited when the man
who manned the place like an observer ordered him to open the paper. Jerry
quickly opened the paper and showed him the prayer point written boldly on it.
‘Are you new here?’ The man asked Jerry calmly.
‘Yes, man of God.’ He replied anxiously.
‘Prayer for employment is N50,000 only.’
‘But, sir, I am jobless. Where do I get such
amount of money from now?’
‘Anywhere, anyhow. Whatever you can do to get
your dreamed employment, can’t you do it?’
‘I can, man of God. But please, pray for me. As soon as I get my first salary, I swear, I will come and pay back.’
‘This is my problem with people who come for employment prayer; they would never put their faith into action. Please go and come tomorrow. We don’t pray for people on credit here.’

Satire 101: Introduction to wife battery and assault,https://punocracy.com/satire-101-introduction-to-wife-battery-and-assault/,2019-08-31T18:32:38+01:00,"By:Timothy Edaki
Unlike many courses in this University of Life,
SAT 101 is a compulsory one for all men. It continues into second semester as
SAT 201- Rudimental of wife battery and assault. It carries the highest credit
load and is open to all male members of the University. There is no given
credit load for it but it is a requirement for every male student immediately
you step into a romantic relationship with the opposite sex. The best time is however
when the relationship has been cemented in marriage.
The course will highlight ways and methods to
teach women, specifically your wife(ves) a lesson. It will proffer solutions to
stopping the “running” mouth of a woman using your hands.
The course has a Guide which serves as a compass towards effective use of the course materials as contained in the course units. There is also provision for tutor-marked assignments which should not be handled with levity by students and a truckload of practicals which will involve bringing your wife to class to assault her.
-You are a man and the automatic ruler, the
lord, the owner of the home.
-Your wife(ves) is (are) subservient to you.
-As a man, you are not allowed to show signs of
weakness or any form of emotion, that is feminine.
-A wife is to serve your sexual needs, attend
to your financial predicament, appease your hunger and provide care and
attention for your children.
-In any of these areas, if she fails, you’re allowed to teach her a lesson.
-In every lesson or beating administered, you
must leave proof that something went down; a black eye, broken bones,
disfigured face, etc.
-Being an alcoholic is a quintessential part of
being a man.
-You are under no obligation to love your
children or provide for them.
The aim of this course is to explore the reaction
between men and subtle or acute stupidity. It is to explain to the
student(male) that your thinking faculties are located not in your brain but in
your hands and between your legs.
At the end of this course, you should be able
to:
1. Provide salient reasons why wife battery and assault is of necessity to society.
2. Explain terms and actions like slaps, blows and other paraphernalia associated with this course.
Major components of this course are:
1. Wife (for practical purpose)
2. Hands (specifically fists)
3. Belt
4. Stick(s)
5. Bottle(s)

Twitter and Giveaway: a Nigerian story of romance and abuse,https://punocracy.com/twitter-and-giveaway-a-nigerian-story-of-romance-and-abuse/,2019-08-31T06:00:25+01:00,"Once, I asked my grandpa (who is Aristotle, by the way) why people in abusive relationships and marriages never run out of it, or do not do so on time, and my grandfather (Aristotle) said, ‘love is something that can take your sense for vanishing, and eventually, only those who seek, see, and those who see, do not seek to enlighten the others.’ Confused, I asked him to contextualize it, and he told me the story of Nigeria.
It was the year 2019, and Twitter was the rave of the world. Nigeria is an organism of many faces, and many genders. In spite of Nigeria’s many faces, it fell in love irresistibly, unequivocally, and unstoppably with Twitter. It was like getting into quicksand; Nigeria sunk deeper whenever it tried to wrestle free.
Twitter was a darling. Twitter loved Nigeria back. It housed Nigeria’s tantrums (protests and revolutions). It was the home of social commentaries, and gave jobs to Nigeria. Without asking, Nigeria moved in with twitter, slept with twitter, and couldn’t stop itself from its drug-like addiction for twitter. According to basedonlogeestiks.com Nigeria loved twitter with its North, East, West, South, and even wore branded bikinis like #ArewaTwitter #YorubaTwitter #IgboTwitter #EdoTwitter, just so this love could fly. Thisfactisright.com also reported an exuberant level of youthfulness in Nigeria’s love affair. But who cares? Love na love.
Twitter worried for Nigeria, but also enjoyed the attention. Twitter wore shirts like #LazyNigerianYouths #EndSARS #RevolutionNow, to show Nigeria that it was worried for Nigeria’s life and focus, and that it needed to take charge, but Nigeria was head over heels. As twitter struggled to help Nigeria find itself, the centre gave away with the introduction of Twitter’s side chick called Giveaway.
Giveaway was liberal, non-conforming, adventurous, and highly addictive. Giveaway was the stuff parents warned their children about, but the children couldn’t stay away from. Giveaway, although being Twitter’s side chic, was so full of fun and life that Nigeria engaged in coital threesome without thinking. Every time someone did something incredibly dangerous, harmful, obnoxious, or stupid, giveaway was introduced, and the offense is soon forgotten. It was even rumoured that one of Nigeria’s faces, a musical artist, cheated on Twitter with Instagram, and came on twitter to mock Nigeria with giveaway. Because giveaway was super sexy, and because Instagram was filled with shots of Twitter (telmabout obsessive behaviour), Nigeria forgot quickly about that one face that wanted to break its relationship with Twitter and Giveaway.
Giveaway became so powerful that Twitter almost changed its name to giveaway. Nigeria on its part was looking for giveaway every day. When Nigeria woke up in the morning, it went to Twitter’s house in search of giveaway. While Nigeria prepared for work, giveaway was on its mind. Nigeria cared less how much it was losing in investments. Nigeria bothered itself not with its erratic attention span and focus. Why focus on working, on development, on building your house, when twitter and giveaway gave you the best fuck of your life?
Slowly, Nigeria began to run mad. When Nigeria walked on the road, it used Twitter and Giveaway bedroom words like ‘BRB, GTG, SMH, LMAO, YDKWGO, Giveaway, Money, Epp me’. Nigeria, Twitter, and Giveaway’s relationship was studied by different Universities across the world. Sabi Boy University, Federal Republic of Jara e, released a research in 2023 that connected Nigeria’s lack of productivity to its love affair with Twitter and Giveaway. The research said “Nigeria has fallen so much in love that it could no longer live outside of Twitter and Giveaway, and this has reduced Nigeria’s productivity by a whopping 700%”. When Nigeria was asked to comment it refused, but was seen the next dear wearing a sexy bikini branded with #HatersGonHate.
What Nigeria did not know was that Twitter fed on this love and replenished. Twitter had so many powerful concubines that even banned Nigeria from visiting them because of its behaviour in Twitter’s house. Twitter commoditized Nigeria, used its addiction to set up many investments, and even sold personal information between Nigeria and Twitter to other concubines. Nigeria did not make regulations, or set up restrictions between it and twitter, because love. And twitter fed on this opportunity. By the year 2030, Nigeria had become so insignificant in economic potential, and had no secrets for Twitter to sell, and giveaway had moved from instant gratification in terms of cash transfers to cryptocurrency, and Nigeria didn’t know how to wait for long before achieving orgasm, so it got tired of twitter and giveaway too. But it was too late.
Twitter bought a flat for the now homeless Nigeria with the name Nigerian Twitter, and prevented it from meeting American Twitter, or the other twitter chics Twitter had. Nigeria tried to pretend vex one time and told Twitter dey your dey, make I dey my dey, and that was the clue Twitter needed. Twitter abandoned the desolate Nigeria and never turned back.
“You see grandchild”, Aristotle said, “bad things happen during good times and good things happen during bad times so fast that it becomes difficult to separate pain from pleasure, love from destruction, and romance from abuse.”"
Surviving Nigerian universities: A soft manual,https://punocracy.com/surviving-nigerian-universities-a-soft-manual/,2019-08-30T05:00:57+01:00,"By: SALAUDEEN, Hawau Oluwakemi
Here’s a friendly reminder that Nigeria is not like every other place, and so are the people. We are the people, and our thing is our thing, it has always been our thing. So do us the honour of keeping it our way; we want no change, don’t preach it.
We are the ones who suffer but never stop smiling, it has been sung in songs and engraved on the heart of everyone you come across and, this fact, I tell you, Is confirmed by the whole world that, we are the happiest people. C’mon, it’s a biological phenomenon, and so, to keep that smile up, you need to know and learn how to survive everywhere, but, herein, it will be how to survive in a Nigerian university. Okay, relax, it’s not really hard, just a few guidelines you should never forget.It will not only help you, but will let you sleep with at least an eye and a half closed.
As a student, all you are sent to school for is to read, never forget that. You just have to keep reading, doesn’t matter what you are reading, the book of life? Book of coitus? remember that when you get a call from home and they ask of where you are, tell them you are in a class or library, even while ridingbroda Saamuaway in town. Watch yourself rise into the position of the family’s favourite and become an example to the others. Anything outside the context of reading puts you in the unserious zone, you don’t want to getcaught. There will be nocaughtin Jesus’ name.
Also, believing everything your lecturer says is another means of survival. You are not allowed to hold a different view or air that opinion of yours. Not following Dr strange’s advice of forgetting everything you think you know won’t help you and it will get you into trouble. Since you know what your lecturer doesn’t know, why are you in class? Your primary purpose in class is to listen and give back to him/her whatever you’ve been given; nothing more or less. Forget the outside world, you won’t be needing it.
Have it in mind that should you hold a contrary opinion to that of the school management, you can’t say or do anything within the Varsity premises or anywhere near it. Feel free to grumble at the corner of your room; suppose the walls have no ears, then you are good. You are not there to tell them what they have to do or what your colleagues need. You are there to say yes to all the terms and conditions. Remember that you want to graduate and that there lots of your colleagues gunning for your seat on the graduation train (if you are a law student). Guard your studentship fiercely. Don’t thank me.
You should know that in any Nigerian school, you don’t needconnectionof any sort except that of God. Of course, everything here is easy and all you need is to follow protocol. Get your papers approved without having to beg for it. It doesn’t matter who you know or who you are, you have to join the queue like every other person because, in Nigeria, everything has a process you need to follow whether by crook or chook and everything will be perfect.Amem?
Are you the type who can’t do much of the first? Or you keep doing it without getting your desired result? Well you should ask yourself of the other things you are willing to offer, cash and kind are generally acceptable. Be willing to give knacks for marks. Like they say, use what you have to get what you want. There is alsoconsentedforce; even though you’re not willing to give it, do not hesitate. May you not be unfortunate. And remember not to say a thing to anyone. No one would even believe. So you see that it’s to your own detriment.
You are a student and that is all you are expected to be while in school. But if you ever dabble into school politics and thea lutasong won’t stop ringing in your head, don’t think too much of yourself into believing you can champion a cause. If you try it, two things are involved — you will end up in the bad books of the authorities, and your fellow students will turn against you. Either way, you lose.
Therefore, bend your back into every office, and polish yoursirandma. Clear your name in their presence and be a puppet. These students won’t give you the degree you want, so?  Think about it. Should journalism be your own calling, write only that which they want to read and thou shall be free with your pen full of ink. Anything contrary can and will send you packing, I’m sorry. So, keep your pen shut to survive.
To stay cool, you have to keep proving it. Your dress sense should speak, your swag should drip, you can leave your GP hanging, but don’t forget to keep reminding yourself of the fact that school is scam. Nothing justifies you better than that conviction. To keep that, you will need a group that thinks like you, those who keep gingering you that you can get away with anything. And if you fall on the other side of the wing, even though you stay awake all night studying your books, in that permanent seat of yours in the library,  never stop singing the school is scam song. Sounds better when crooned with students with half a kobo GP, and the ones who only remember their books when the exam is tomorrow. The Campus is a land of fun, it will be unfair if you don’t have your share.
Remember your anthem, thou shall look for all means to hide thyself and stay away from trouble, even if it includes snitching on the student leaders. Never criticize those who indulge in this act, join them in the act if possible. There is, therefore, a fat reward for your involvement in either — a delay in your transcript or delay in graduation. Or a swift graduation process followed by a recommendation letter (maybe for employment). I assure you that it’ll be worth it.
May our good Lord be with you, and may your survivalist struggle come to a fruitful end at convocation.

ACT ONE SCENE ONE:On the Road
Four men are seen on stage driving a Volkswagen 1960 Model. They are pot-bellied men. Their voices are so hoarse and deep they have to clear their throats more than five times before anyone can hear them talk. They are clad in whiteagbadaspotted with different specks of dirt, in different places. The Volkswagen is on its last legs. The heads of the men in the vehicle are cobwebbed. The vehicle is rat-infested with torn seats asides the fact that it has lost its balance, no thanks to overloading. The men are to deliver thirty-six pies to thirty-six towns.
Senator Hau: (giggles as he drives recklessly on the road full of waterlogged potholes) I inherited reckless driving from my father when he was still alive. He taught me that reckless driving makes one enjoy the speed rate of one’s car without losing concentration to pedestrians who journey the same road on their legs. Even though they need our help, we sight them not because of our reckless driving. Many of them smell. We can’t put a spoilt egg among the good ones.
Passer-by: (shouts as the car splashes muddy water on him) What kind of driver are you? You don’t even care about pedestrians trekking the same road you on which recklessly drive your car; splashing muddy water from the water-logged and potholed roads you refused to repair for us?
Senator Hau: Ahh! See the way he shouted just because my Volkswagen 1960 Model splashed some yellow beer on him. Enjoy it, poverty-infested fellow. We won’t allow you to have a bicycle, let alone a car. You will die trekking this road one day.
Chief Yor: Yes! When I take this car from you, I will drive it worse than you do now. I will not only splash muddy water but I will also hit those poor pedestrians so they can die before their time. Ahh!
Igb: Wait! Have you forgotten these same people you begged and prostrated yourself for a few months ago to have their YES before you got this vehicle?
Senator Hau: Didn’t we already pay them for their YES? These people only need a bite of the pie. In fact, you don’t have to put it in their mouth to cut it themselves; just cut a peanut size for them.
Chief Justice Ful: (brings out the thirty-six pies from his pocket. He smells them and quickly tries to swallow them all). Wow! These pies are better eaten by one person. I will be a fool if we’re to allow you deliver these pies to those they belong to. Don’t you think all these things belong to us here? People out there don’t know if the pies are theirs or not. In fact, it is not their right but a mere privilege.
(The driver parks on the road, leading to
traffic jam, to join the other three men. They all start tussling to eat the
pies. The pies become a messy smash, staining their white agbada, mouths and
beards).

ACT ONE SCENE TWO: On the Street
Early in the morning, a man is seen on stage holding a Bible and a cross in his hands. He wears a white robe with a pair of female pants hung across his neck. He is flanked by a group of people with placards in their hands. One of the placards reads, “Pastors too are guilty of rape. Crucify him.”
First man: (shouting) He is a true man of God oo. His calling is to anoint the private parts of his female worshippers with the oil that disgorges from the bottle within his thighs.
Second man: …also called to suck the oranges on the trees of their bosoms. That is called the holy sucking.
First woman: He is also a good player and preyer. He plays well on their twin organs and rests his head on them every night in intercessions.
Prophet Solo: I’m a true man of God who preaches and does the truth. Ma’am Toyin is one of my customers. She came for marital business. I was just tempted by the devil at the weak time of my ministry. Wait! Open to John 8: 1-11.
Second woman: (laughs) Oh! Ministry of Rap—ism. You were tempted at a time the spirit in you went on holidays? Man of all women, are you still quoting the Bible? You’ve been found guilty of rape. Caught outright in the name of private vigils. Justify that in your unholy Scripture.
Prophet Solo: I was only doing the work of the Lord as directed towards her.
Second man: …the work of the Lord or your own lord?
Ma’am Toyin: He told me to pull off my pants that he wanted to anoint something on my thighs. He said once he did that I would be pregnant and have a set of triplets. I obeyed him and suddenly, he pushed me down.
Prophet Solo: She only fell under anointing!
Ma’am Toyin: What fake anointing was that? You pushed me ni (weeps).
The crowd: (starts beating him and singing along) our pro-phet has ra-ped sis-ter To-yin. He has ra–ped. He has ra–ped. He has ra–ped Chief Yor’s wife.

ACT ONE SCENE THREE: In the Court
The Prophet is seen in the dock. Chief Justice
Ful is the judge to preside over the case. There is a noise in the courtroom.
The clerk calls for silence at the arrival of the judge.
Clerk: Courtttt!
Barrister Lai: My client, Prophet Solo, is not guilty of any offence, my Lord. He didn’t rape her customer, Ma’am Toyin. She only came for a marital business in which my client was only taking her through the process. My client’s customer needs a child. A woman can’t have a baby while standing, my Lord. She needs to sleep. It is a practical business, my Lord.
Barrister Lailai: My Lord, Prophet Solo is guilty of the offence before him. This woman is the wife of  Chief Yor. She has no child from her marriage, yet. Prophet Solo forced himself on his customer when my client had sneaked to his place when Chief  Yor was not at home. This is a rape case, my Lord. Prophets are also guilty of the sins they preach against in their Bible. Let’s treat this case like a biblical sin, my Lord. Prophet Solo should be sentenced to hell, my Lord.
Chief Justice Ful: (soliloquies) This is the right time to punish Chief Yor. He alone wanted to eat the pies without giving us.
Having listened to the case as being presented
by Barrister Lai and Barrister Lailai; this is my verdict. Ma’am Toyin is
hereby separated from Chief Yor and declared as Prophet Solo’s wife. I rise!

The lord’s bishop of

Is a disguised devil

Who carves brilliant
gems of deceit
On the hearts of

Who seek salvation

He is a pious
winebibber
Who speaks in diverse
kinds of tongues
And yet claims the
spirit is always at work
Every time he drinks
from a flagon of wine
And get intoxicated
with a hard cider.
He is a salacious
baptizer
Who baptizes ladies
with libidinal secretion,
An acclaimed
custodian of the heavenly mysteries
Who slides through
the crevice betwixt virgin’s legs
In search of the
creator’s secrets in their esclitorides.
He is a deceitful
gospeler
Who preaches about
the doom of Sodom
Yet commits whoredom
with rotten testes,
And desecrates the sacredness
of our altar
With strange incense
and blind sacrifices.
The lord’s bishop of
our cathedral
Is a flesh-driven,
pragmatic evangelist
Who parades himself
as God’s own oracle
But refuses to adhere
to divine ordinances
That open worshippers to spiritual realities.

Letter to my next abuser,https://punocracy.com/letter-to-my-next-abuser/,2019-08-29T04:00:16+01:00,"By:Oguntunji Abidemi Emman
Dear next abuser,
How I got your contact will remain a mystery – forever hidden! Even, I, the honourable messenger, don’t know how your contacts got into my hand. Do not take me as the all-knowing, (the one who knows the inside and outside of a human being). Well, one doesn’t fix an appointment with fate. Fate grasps whom it wants, when it wants; when it moves in the direction of your desire, it brings you plenitude. More often than not, when it crosses you, it brings you down. Howbeit, one has to endure. Dear abuser, fate brought about your contact.
Lest I become a
loquacious fool, one who leaves the clear path and beats about the bush. I will
introduce myself to you. I am a creation of the creations created by the
uncreated creator. I am SNIPER, the honourable messenger. My mission is simple
– killing of insects with no mercy. This is the job the one who created me gave
to me and I always make sure I carry out my responsibility with prompt
effectiveness.
Even though it is
written on my label that I am meant for outdoor use (on farms or greenhouses)
and I need to be mixed with water to reduce the high potency of my effect but
trust Nigerians who will always act as a one. They changed my use – converting
me to replace insecticides in homes even in offices. Baygon, Raid, Mobil and
others have waged war against me in deviant of our close ties. My offence?
Betrayal of kinsmen they claim! Nigerians neglected them due to my
affordability and efficiency. My creator understood the rudiments of business,
so he created me in smaller and bigger packs. A 100ml bottle of my noble
content goes for N200 while that of my kinsmen cost as much as N750. Why then
am I being blamed?
I thought I had seen it all until death wrote a petition against me. He accused me of not being a registered distributor of his ageing products and for sending people to their place of eternal rest without proper consultation. He complained that ‘Dane guns’, ‘hanging’ and ‘Gammalin 20’ – registered distributors of his products – have started losing customers. Nigerians now prefer to patronise me for the quickening of their eternal rest. All these accusations made the Nigerian government to place a ban on the manufacturing of my smaller packs. They posit that I have become a choice killer for people contemplating suicide.  If one finger brought oil, it soiled the others. My effectiveness and affordability have brought this great disaster on me. What have I done wrong? Is it a crime to be cheap?
My dear, before you empty my content into your mouth, perhaps you should see what will happen to you after a few minutes.
Below is the
testimony of April Wolf, a social media user, about me.
“Sniper is not an easy killer, it’s an organ
eating, liquid monster. Sniper is a Dichlorovinyl Dimethyl Phosphate compound,
produced by NDI Swiss Nigeria chemical company. When you want to kill yourself
by drinking Sniper, this is what will happen to you:
1. Your eyeballs will swim in its own water as forced tears escape from its reservoir.
2. You will have
serious discharges from your nose.
3. A banging migraine
will set in. You will hold onto your head and scream like it wants to explode.
4. Your chest will tighten making sure that your body loses control over it.
5. You will be on the
floor, screaming through all your senses, as saliva pours out from your mouth
like a slow, mini river.
6. You will mess yourself up with vomits. You will long to vomit your intestines too because you are now in so many regrets for taking the sniper but sniper must finish its job.
7. The rest of the
crises comes in turns as you shit all over yourself. Your life will be squeezed
out of you through the shutting down of your lungs and kidney
Your friends and
families will see your dead body with your eyes open and a lot of poo in your
underwear. Your body twisted in a strange position as you tried to fight off
the pain and crises and they will observe the signs of struggle in the room you
took the sniper because you will climb the walls, tear the sheets, rip some of
your hair off, just to quail the killing pain.
You are deceived when
they make you believe that sniper is the easiest way out. No! It will slowly
devour you from the inside, as it shuts down your organs one by one in a
tearing order”.
Do you know Seun Mogaji, a popular disc jockey in Lagos who committed suicide by drinking my honourable content after an unresolved marital crisis with his wife? What about the 18year old Loveth from Ekiugbo community in Delta state? Well, she consumed three bottles of my humble self after she couldn’t meet up with JAMB’s cut off marks for her course. You must have heard about Aduba Daniel, a student at Niger Delta University, who killed himself ‘because of carryovers at school’. There are many more customers who have purchased the tickets to eternal rest from me.
Putting off the
garment of satire, what about those sets of people who have refused to drink
insecticides when they experienced their dose of failures, disappointments,
setbacks and challenges?
Orji Uzor Kalu. This name must have struck a chord of remembrance in your head I guess. He was the former governor of Abia state. Do you know that he was rusticated from the University of Maiduguri for participating in students’ protest? What about Mercy Johnson? One of the highest-paid Nollywood actresses of our time. She failed JAMB so many times that she resulted into acting. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean, through the Sahara Desert to the other side of the antipode is Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of United State of America. Well, he endured a steady stream of failure and defeat before becoming president of the United States. He lost eight elections, failed twice in business and suffered a nervous breakdown. But did he taste, not to talk of drinking my humble self?
All of these people
didn’t quit and because they didn’t, became great in life. Do you really think
killing yourself will end your sadness? No! The brave faced their worst fear
eyeball to eyeball while the coward quit at the mention of their worst fear.
Dear abuser, before
you empty the contents into your mouth. Think of the fury I am going to unleash
inside of you. But in case, you still want to go ahead with abusing me, I wish
you a painless, slow tempo death.
Your best one,
SNIPER.

How to be relevant in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-relevant-in-nigeria/,2019-08-29T00:27:07+01:00,"Whether Nigeria is the World Poverty Capital (WPC) or not as stated by theOyinbos, Nigerians can still be relevant in Nigeria even with unproductive and unforthcoming policies of the government. TheOyinbosdecided to create confusion in the country by giving Nigeria that derogatory tag. Have they got no idea at all of the plethora of wealthy people we have in Nigeria or the aristocratic politicians who steal from the public funds to enrich themselves? Or will they say they were not aware of the fact that Alison Madueke’s “seized possessions” value more than Bill Gate’s net worth? Or the fact that President Buhari has been allocating N5000 to citizens of  Nigeria? Why then should we be the WPC!
Nigerians can be relevant in Nigeria against all odds. To this effect, I have compiled a useful guide to becoming relevant in Nigeria even with the current mishaps the country is experiencing.
YOU MUST BE AN INEFFECTIVE PRESIDENT:
You see when you are doing well to the country, Nigerians will not be happy with you. If there’s adequate security and abundance of food, Nigerians will not acknowledge you. The best way you can be relevant in Nigeria is to have shortcomings in your duties as the President. Make sure there’s no adequate security even when you promise exactly that. Make sure the price of petrol increases drastically even when you promise a tremendous reduction.
This way Nigerians will speak about you every day and hail you with series of curses, excretions and imprecations. No doubt you’ll be relevant. A good example is that of President Buhari who promised change but brought the opposite. Almost everyday, Nigerians give him a share in their daily curses. How better to be relevant, right?
EMBEZZLE FUNDS:
My people, see, there is no saint anywhere. The earth is corrupt so we must be corrupt with it. Even the angels that Baba God sent to earth fumbled, so what of us humans. My people, you must embezzle funds to become relevant in Nigeria. If you are an anti-corruption advocate,oo le ri(you can’t see). The more you are caught in the web of corruption, the more you become relevant in Nigeria especially as your name appears daily in the newspaper.
So steal as much as you can, bribe the Justices so they can give injustice.Shabe involved in anything corruption, you’ll be relevant. If you are in doubt, take a look at Alison Madueke, Atiku Abubakar, and the like. Aren’t they relevant in Nigerian polity?
BREAK THE NORMS:
You see conforming to the societal norms and conventions cannot give you relevance. If you obey what the society says, my people, you will just remain there. So if you are a guy, change your gender to a lady. Be like Bobrisky–the Idris guy that became slay mama. By so doing, Nigerians will clamour at such audacity and with that, you’ll begin to gain prominence and relevance. An average Nigerian knows Bobrisky. I think you see the relevance.
Also, you’ll be the prayer point of many Nigerian mothers. Have you heard a mother pray that her children will not be unfortunate like Bobrisky? You haven’t heard? Since Nigerians are prayer warriors, using your name as prayer point or as a negative example in the society will definitely give you relevance.
SING BAD BONGS:
If you are the type that sings,“God is good, He has done it for me,” my people, you’ll die there. You can never be relevant. You must sing songs that celebrate moral putrescence and societal decadence like Naira Marley, Zlatan, and a host of others. You must be able to sing songs that promote internet fraud, masturbation, etcetera. My goodness, Nigerians will hail you!
Though the intelligent ones will chastise you, do not be bothered especially when the not-so-intelligent Nigerians will respect you. You see, you don’t even need intelligent people toblowor be relevant. Since it is said that Nigerians are gullible, you will just increase their gullibility with the stupidity of your songs.
Have you heard about one fine lady that was ranting on Instagram because Naira Marley liked her page? So you see how the power of bad songs can bring you followers? Singing bad songs, therefore, gives you prominence and relevance in Nigeria especially in this era of dwindling standards of education.  And, as a bad song crooner, you’ll be our role model.
BE A FAKE CLERIC:
If you are a cleric that speaks the truth, my people, you cannot be relevant. As a religious person, you must know how to lie. Mis-direct Nigerians with your fake prophecies especially as your words are divine revelations from the Almighty. If you make a true prophecy, Nigerians will not recognize you.
In Nigeria, we hate truths; so feed us with religious lies. For example, if you prophesy that Buhari will die, Nigerians will recognize you and even chant loud “Amen” to your prophecy. And when your prophecy does not come to pass, Buhari people will come for you. Amidst the confusion, punchlines and rebuttals, you will be relevant. Trust me!
BE A GENEROUS DRIVER:
To be relevant as well, you must be a generous Danfo or Taxi driver in possession of many denominations of Naira, so you can just hand a few of them over to the Men in Black. You then drive gallantly to checkpoints without a driver’s license, while waiting for the Men in Black to salute you and chant your name endlessly. Keep committing such atrocity and you will be relevant. On the highway at least.
YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO ABUSE:
If I say you must know how to abuse, please don’t take after the nature of the Ibadan local women—they are not relevant. Great abuse is a well-packaged abuse. Go to the social media and abuse the president of Nigeria or any of his equivalents. Go to Twitter and tweet: #Buhari is a fuck-upnigga, or something like that. You’ll be surprised to see the number of re-tweets.
Keep abusing your leaders as the cause of the bad situation in the country while you do nothing to change the status quo except by pointing accusing fingers. The more you abuse your leaders at the corridors of power, the more you are cited as a patriotic citizen and the resultant effect is“relevance.”
This is the end of my voyage. Expect more as time flies. If you are done perusing my useful guide, you’d probably shoot me with a toy gun.

Open letter to Mr. President: Let’s talk about the Muhammadu Buhari University,https://punocracy.com/open-letter-to-mr-president-lets-talk-about-the-muhammadu-buhari-university/,2019-08-28T05:40:30+01:00,"By:Abdurrahman
Bello ONIFADE
Dearest Mr.
President,
I am just happy writing to you. I
can’t explain but I know even my happiness is happy too. Nigeria is blessed to
have a president like you. Never since independence has the nation been so
lucky to have a president who ‘belongs to everybody’ and at the same time
‘belongs to nobody.’ If the colonialists who handed political power to our
na-thieves could see the future, they would probably have waited more to ensure
Nigeria’s first president is ‘integrity’ personified. And no one is that except
you. Well, we are still lucky anyway. Let’s praise the Lord!
They say God’s time is the best. And that is why no sane person will doubt that there is no best time to establish the Muhammadu Buhari University (MBU) than now. If not for fear of being taken away by our loving Department of State Security (DSS), I would have disclosed for long that I’m in love with your wife, Aisha Buhari. Sorry, the ‘First Lady.’ She is not only beautiful but very intelligent. Only an intelligent woman could think of establishing a university in the name of her husband. Immortalization at its best. Perfect!
The First Lady has consistently
shown that despite your wonderful faux pass that she belongs to the ‘Oza Room,’
she will not stop loving you – her one and only ‘Baba Go-Slow.’ Love is a
beautiful thing. Come to think of it: has any other First Lady ever thought of
establishing a university in her husband’s name? No. Not even Mama Peace whose
husband holds a PhD in ‘Docility’ and ‘Democratic Championship.’
Mr. President, so I read in some
reports that works have begun on the establishment of the MBU. I know you may
not know. But speaking in a press conference last week inside your office,
Solomon Dalong, who said he has been appointed acting Director, Public Communications,
for MBU, revealed that about “N3billion is to be ‘spended’ on infrastructural
developments of the Muhammadu Buhari University, Yola.”
I am so happy to hear the news.
Flanked by the controversial police officer, Joseph Mbu, the acting Chief
Security Officer of your yet-to-be-established university, Dalong said, “The
First Lady had perfected discussions with investors during the last lesser hajj
she had with the President in Saudi Arabia. Plans and percentage of funding to
be released from both the Federal Government of Nigerian (FGN) and the Saudi
investors will, however, be finalized during the next hajj operations.”
The statement further reads in
part: “The Muhammadu Buhari University will be established in Yola and
subsequently, campuses will be constructed in all geopolitical zones of the
nation. The reason for this is not far-fetched. The President who is an
embodiment of integrity and the only incorruptible Nigerian on planet earth
wants every Nigerian to be like him. He has said repeatedly that if we don’t
kill corruption, corruption will kill us. Therefore, MBU is all out to ensure
corruption is eradicated in Nigeria.”
That was just too perfect Mr. President. Imagine if every Nigerian was just like you. Owning nothing but some cows. No houses in Texas, Dubai or Johannesburg. And one may only check into a London hospital to treat an unknown ailment, with public funds. It doesn’t matter if one spends more than 100 days; so long other animals will sit up when the ‘Lion King’ returns to the jungle. Oh! That’s so sweet.
Mr. President, my personal findings revealed from Dalong’s statement that the choice of Yola was mainly to counter the activities of the American University of Nigeria (AUN), Yola. The AUN seems to be running a clandestine programme in ‘Server Hacking.’ I believe something has to be done about it. I was even told that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said if nothing is done to check it by the FGN, the integrity of the 2023 elections could be compromised even before they are conducted. We cannot allow that to happen. Never.
So can we just place advert for
application for your university? We have to be careful of the applicants so
that the set objectives of MBU are not undermined. Like you said your ministers
must be people you know, the applicants must have qualities we know. I have a
few suggestions for the kinds of applicants MBU needs. We could just make it
like this:
The Muhammadu Buhari University, Yola, through its Directorate of Public Communications, hereby calls for application to fill its academic and non-academic positions. All applicants, especially for principal offices, must:
* have 15 years cognate experience is prioritization of frivolous projects in the academia.
* be pot-bellied or with potential signs of obesity.
Note: Applicants’ bellies will be measured with a ruler and anyone whose belly is less than 5 inches will be disqualified outright.
*have a decade experience in deflating students’ ‘gra-gra’ during protest.
* have engaged in intellectual theft (i.e. plagiarism) and not be interested in research or academic excellence. The MBU is meant to kill corruption not raise some intelligentsia who will agitate for‘knowledge economy’,‘political will’or‘good governance.’
* be willing at all times to by-pass due process and employ the services of kits and kin, friends and relatives, without public outcry.
* not have his/her children in Nigerian public institutions.
*be ready to suppress press freedom on campus and justify managerial ineptitude with either temperamental arrogance, by suspending and banning virile students’ union and unionists or both.
Note:The MBU is aimed at raising intellectual robots who are conformists to social ills; not some chaps who will tell theirin loco parentisthat a fly has perched on their scrotums.
I
know you would like the draft above. Can we just earmark N150 million only for
advert placements in New York Times, Washington Post and London Guardian? At
least if Hadi Sirika could launch the failed Nigeria Air project abroad, we can
do same too for this. This won’t fail though.
And
Mr. President, you know oyinbo people say failing to plan is planning to fail.
Let’s plan the ahead. I already know the best courses to be run at MBU. No
university in the world runs such programmes. Check this out too:
The Muhammadu Buhari University
hereby announces admission into the following programmes:
Professional
Certificatesin:
–
Kickboxing and Fence Scaling
– Python
Dance and Related Operations
–
Grass-cutting Logistics
– Cattle
Colony
– Theatrics
of Delay in Minimum Wage and Implementation
– Mace
Theft and Legisla-thieve Hooliganism
Professional
Mastersin:
– Banditry
and Kidnapping
– Budget
Padding
– School
Feeding and Stomach Infrastructure
– Ruga–ism
– Dignified
Incompetence and Political Mediocrity
Note: Applicants for the
professional masters programme in ‘Dignified Incompetence and Political
Mediocrity’ must apply through the Speaker, Kaduna State House of Assembly –
under whose headship a competent critic of the governor was disqualified from
public service; or by proxy through the APC mob who protested the appointment
of one Dr. Festus Adedayo and ensured the decision was rescinded.
PhDin:
– Vote Buying
–
Corruption Subsidy
Note:
Application for the PhD programme in ‘Corruption Subsidy’ is open only to
politicians whose cases with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
(EFCC) have either been withdrawn or pardoned due to their political affiliation
with the President. Mr. President belongs to a party of saints, run by saints
and for soon-to-be saints. It doesn’t matter if these saints had stolen public
treasury in sums more than what will be ‘spended’ on establishing the MBU.
I know you love
it already Mr. President. I’m doing all these free of charge. Should members of
the press or opposition contact you at all, just tell them in your usual manner
of knowing ‘nothing’ about ‘everything’ that: “I don’t know what you are
talking about. I heard one Joseph Mbu has been parading himself as the CSO of
MBU because he bears same name with the school acronym. I can assure I will
talk to my wife about it in the ‘oza room’; but get more details from
Osinbajo.”
Meanwhile, I
know some groups of Nigerians under the aegis of ‘We Cannot Take It Movement’
may through their counsel, Orubebe and Sons, petition or sue you over the
establishment of MBU. That won’t be an issue at all. We can get Justice
Aiyeniromo Onye-ara of the Federal High Court in Abuja to adjourn the case till
May 29, 2023; stating that “all parties concerned must be in court.”
What do you think Mr. President? Please do reply me before responding to Obasanjo’s open letter. Cheers!

A Nigerian guide to becoming influential: The Invictus Obi starter pack,https://punocracy.com/a-nigerian-guide-to-becoming-influential-the-invictus-obi-starter-pack/,2019-08-28T05:39:14+01:00,"By: Theophilus Femi Alawonde
Hello, good people of Nigeria. It’s a beautiful week! Welcome to Weekly Words of Wisdom. This week, we are going to systematically look into valid ways of becoming influential in Nigeria, following the Invictus Obi starter pack to the letter. Do you know our hero, the inspiration for this model of becoming influential, Invictus Obi? Perhaps you know him by the name Obinwanne Okeke? Oh! You have heard the rumours too? About him being a fraudster and all? They are rumours, disregard them. Invictus Obi is an investor, and an eagle-eyed entrepreneur, who went phishing and caught millions of dollars.
So, how do you become
influential in a nation where your wealth is your worth, a nation where the
bulginess of your pocket determines where, or where not your feet can find
their way to? You need not do much, trust me. How do you find your feet and
rise above the murky waters, in a nation where subtle stealing is the order of
the day? Following the steps I have below will sure take you to the promised
land. So, what have we?
Before I go on, do not forget that Invictus obi is our model, and why should he not be? After all, he made the Forbes Africa 30 Influential Persons under 30 list in the year 2016. What an example. I digress too much. Now, to thekoko:
If you think the woke I mean is sharing thoughts that would not even be bought for a kobo on social media, then you don know was going on. The new woke is to get into the hustle, mingle with boys, and be taught the black trade that is fast making white men fear. If you want to play slow and steady, go for Yahoo. It might take you some time before you blowsha. If you are more interested in quick riches and the resultant early visit to the grave, you could try Yahoo-plus-ing. However, the best I have to offer, the most suitable in line with the Invictus Obi model, is wire, or what some know as wire-wire. This is not for lazy youth, please! It requires bright minds and much more capital than all other forms. It is an entrepreneurial skill, and facilitators would sure be paid.
To improve the efficacy of your dabbling into wire, get degrees. You do not necessarily have to get an education, just get degrees; Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctorate, if possible. Let one of them be from the abroad, so it would be easier to form your success story when you have blown.
You see all those ones that run away to Dubai or Malaysia after having blown from thechachebusiness, they can never be one-yard influential. So, do not depart from this path. When you have blown, – and that should be some two to three years, depending on how good you are, and how few your village people are, or the level of their determination to ruin your life- invest the money you made. Do not be tempted to spend on women and betting and drinks, you will end up miserably. Look at our model, he founded the Invictus Group with the 11 million dollars he made. Once you have capital as huge as some millions of dollars, it would not be difficult to start a company.
Buy a large expanse of land, build a state-of-the-art infrastructure, bribe the Corporate Affairs Commission, register the company, do somewuruwuruinterviews and employ about 2,000 Nigerians at once. Don’t worry about what they would be doing, they are Nigerians, they would be perfectly cool with coming to office every morning to do nothing, in as much as the salary does not stop. Don’t stop there, dabble into whatever sector you can dabble into. Scatter their heads with money, and you would start making profits. The profits might not be massive, but you could start adding your ill-gotten wealth to it little by little, as you declare your assets. Have a working ratio, say profits 45% and ill-gotten wealth 55% of your net worth. This way, it would be hard to smell foul. In five years’-time, you would have blown
At
this time of your life, the elites in the echelon of the societal strata would
begin to notice you. They would invite you to parties, go, and spray them
plenty money, don’t be stingy. This way, your face would make it to more and
more glossy pages of the dailies. The governor is a year older? Buy multiple
pages in the dailies to wish him well. The president has just returned from
another treatment of his ear in London? Buy multiple pages in the dailies to
welcome him back to the soil. This way, you would become more popular.
Remember, the goal is to become as influential as you can be.
At this point, the king of your village would have heard of the son of the soil doing exploits. He might, no, he would surely invite you to take on one or two chieftaincy titles, do just that. Build a block of classrooms in the community primary school, dig a borehole, and tar the road to your parents’ house. No one would say you have not done well. Do not forget the God that gave you the wealth. Take huge amounts of money as a tithe to church; or if you are a Muslim, donate handsomely to the building of an ultra-modern mosque, and give alms to whoever you can give it to. This way, God would not be so cross with you.
My brother, at this
point, the poor and the middle class would have noticed you too, including the
media. They would want to know how you did it, your success story. At this
point, we are almost getting there!
Yes, you saw that right, start a charity foundation. One, it would be a way of asking God to turn away his eyes from the evil you did in the beginning, and two, it would be a way of reaching out to more people and getting more influential. Ensure you are married before starting a charity foundation. Name it after yourself, and let your wife run it. Even if it is to share rice to thousands of Nigerians during Christmas, just start a foundation.
Nigerians are a humble people, they do not need much proof before they revere you. After all,N2,000 is enough to buy their votes. When you have started the foundation, the media and NGOs would start taking you more seriously. You would be invited to shows, and talks, both locally and internationally. In simple terms, you have blown.
However, do not forget “your success story.” Nigerians love stories, and they would sure want to hear yours. Thankfully, this is not difficult to form. Yes, you talk about your humble beginnings, and how you had to struggle. Talk about your determination to stand out. If you schooled abroad as I advised earlier, talk about having to run multiple menial jobs, the frugal way you spent, and the handsome way you saved your money, till it became enough to start a business. You could talk about the small loan you obtained. If you did not go to the abroad to school, there is a plan B for you. Just say, “It’s been God, it’s been God’s grace.” No, Nigerians will not overreact, they will surely forget you all enjoy that God’s grace. This plan B is actually subject to you dropping a large lump of money to shut them up. And like magic, they would keep mum about your stories that touch but do not spark. Some yards more, and we would be finally there.
Yes, this is the last step to fully becoming influential in Nigeria. Forget about the maxim that the best way to hide something from a black man is to put it in a book. If the book is by one rich somebody, people will buy and read. So, what types of books do I advise you to write? An autobiography, a biography, or a motivational book. The bottom line is, be the subject of the book; its A-Z. If it is an autobiography, write your flowery but watery success story. If it is a biography, ensure your praises, and yours alone, are sung therein. If it is a motivational book, make sure each chapter leads to one story or the other in which you are the hero. This way, millions will get to read about you.
My brother, if you have
not started gracing Times Magazine, Forbes, and other business and achievement
magazines by now, then Buhari does not hail from Daura. At this point, let me
congratulate you on having successfully become an influential somebody.
However, shine your eyes. Ensure you do not leave trails that would jeopardize your blissful-looking future. Because, the village people factor. FBI or CIA or worse still, ordinary EFCC, might start looking for you. Omo, cover your tracks well, and be woke.
Have a wonderful week.

Mediocrity is praying,https://punocracy.com/mediocrity-is-praying/,2019-08-27T06:26:21+01:00,"By: Francis Olamide
The prayer of a Nigerian carries a distinct aroma into the heavens. The entire heavens recognise the Nigerian prayer from afar. God, the almighty, must be very much acquainted with the prayer of Nigerians, if not tired. Even the prayer-carrying angels must be weary of presenting the petitions of Nigerians to God. And you know Nigerians, they possess great prowess in shooting prayer vocabularies.
Since I was born and now I’m growing up, I’ve never seen a nation whose citizenry will put one leg on top of another to vote an incompetent leader on election day and then go ahead to organise revival, white fasting garnished with prayer crusades and different colours of vigil to invoke the spirit of competence upon the incompetent leader. Is it by force? A man cannot give what he doesn’t have,se eti yin dii nii? You left a professor to vote someone with controversial WAEC results, I see you’re a well-meaning citizen of your fatherland.
E je kama gbadura fun won(let’s keep praying for them) is always their sharp response when you highlight the decadence in their ‘all is well’ nation to them. Daddy, did they use your brain to wrapakarawhen you went to the polling unit to vote this incompetence? Tell me. Who borrowed your sense on election day? Now you’re using your prayer vocabularies to disturb the heavens. Because God doesn’t sleep or slumber, does that mean you shouldn’t let him properly ruminate on the dimension of thunder that will fire looters of public funds in Nigeria?
Science and common sense will put an end to some things but, no, Nigerians must pray about it.
One of them, a member of Aladura People’s Congregation (APC) once yelled at me, “Ola, we must pray o! This bloodshed in the land is demonic. It’s from the powers of the inner circle. My daddy’s uncle’s sister’s mummy’s aunty has battled it before. Nigeria is under attack from the pit of hell; pray!” Aunty, it’s not from the pit of hell, it’s from the pit of Aso rock.
Well, I think “fixing portholes” has been added to the job description of the angels; the cherubs should be able to provide proper health care; and there’s no way the seraphs cannot provide ordinary pipe-borne waternah. Isn’t it? Since all power belongs to God, prayers should be able to generate enough Kilowatt of electrical energy needed to satisfy the power needs of Nigerians while we pay less attention to power generation policy. Who policy help when there’s prayer?
Tell them about the international companies that are moving out of the country, they’ll still twist you with, “They’re the devils we’re talking about. God is chasing them out” Ah, which devil? Devil is leaving your country with thousands of his former employees jobless? That devil must be hornless with an office in the statehouse.
I don’t know how we don’t know that something is wrong somewhere with our country when our prayer points begin to tilt toward the provision of basic amenities. When prayer for protection from terrorist attacks, provision of good road, provision of healthcare facilities and pipe-borne water supply begins to creep into your prayers, it’s either something is doing your country or your country is doing something. Can’t you see the way people in the UK, US, and Canada are screaming those prayers in religious places? Ehn, tell me. If we remove those things from your prayers, I doubt if you’ll have a devil to chase again. Well, you won’t even know, the land is flowing with milk and honeynah.
See how all your prayers since 1960 have produced plenty crude oil refinery for the nation, many monumental projects apart from the ones theoyinbosleft us with, ASUU has stopped striking like thunder, thenumber of our out-of-school children has drastically reduced, and we even produce more foodstuff than we can take. See how we export our best hands abroad because of surplus development here, and portable water continues to reach all Nigerians.Sisi mii, aku adura o!"
Menascum: The definitive guide to dealing with Mr No-Goods,https://punocracy.com/menascum-the-definitive-guide-to-dealing-with-mr-no-goods/,2019-08-27T06:07:18+01:00,"By:Anifowoshe Ibrahim
In my first year in the university, I lived with weed smokers. It was a room of Royal Highnesses with the smoke constantly floating miasma-like. Every day, I had to answer the door around 2 am because someone wanted to “buy kush.” It was the smoke that bothered me. Somehow, I had begun to take note of how much time I was left to second-hand smoke. Averagely, it was 2 hours each day. I thought it was wild and unfair to leave these smokers to unleash their addiction on the rest of us. That they had the right to smoke anytime, anywhere with no regard for others. And when I had talked to people, they just shrugged it off as normal.
Although you might not see it this way, I am beginning to see that women are exposed to Men who are ordinarily animals. Who they subtly refer to as scum, in modern culture. It’s as if, just like the weed smoke, men were unleashed upon women in such ferocious manner that they seek to satisfy their selfish addiction anytime, anywhere. So, here’s a guy telling you how to deal with thesescummanders. I have decided to break the Bro Code. But before you start to get the munchies ladies, let’s go,
First, you must understand that the men I refer
to here mean all men. You see, ladies, when you say “Men are scum,”
ensure that you say it at the top of your voice because that’s what it’s. Any
attempt to be shut down, scream it louder.
Second, you will meet men that say otherwise.
Those ones that shrug it off and attempt to explain that there are some good
men out there. They know it’s untrue. They know what their fellow men are doing
to women. From stabbing them with their manhood to breaking hearts like
they score FIFA goals, they know. Call them hypocrites. Ladies,
remind them they’re scums.
Third, those that attempt to remind you that not all men are scum are the insecure ones. They’re like white people hiding their obvious racism. When black people say “black lives matter,” they say “all lives matter.” They say it like we didn’t already know that. These men will tell you not all men are scum like you didn’t already know that too. They use their insecurities to overshadow the important discourse. Look out for them. When you find them, ladies, remind them of what they’re– scums.
“Problems are not stop signs, they are
guidelines”
— Robert H. Schuller, a scum.
It’s very important at this point to divide scums into categories. There are two types of scum. You wouldn’t know this, the bro code isn’t kind with snitches. They are: Scum of the Earth; Scum of Circumstances. Scum E and Scum C. Scum E are those that you’re closest to. They’re the worst model of men. You have names for them with tribal, societal, medical, status, religious innuendos: Yoruba demons; rapist; pedophile; pastor; imams; lecturers; etc. Scum C are those, who due to circumstances, become scums. I know this explains nothing, follow me to understand.
Recognising scum is quite hard. This is because we men mix seamlessly. We are like rainwater and tap water in a bucket. You just have to try and try to separate us. Few women have been successful in the past. I don’t have a definition for Scum C because they’re the same class of people as Scum E. However, I think the work of women will do justice in defining them.
Enter Charlotte Proudman. A lawyer of 27 years at Michael Mansfield QC and a PhD student at Cambridge. Starting out, climbing ladders, winning cases, Proudman was an award-winning lawyer. Being a good lawyer, she was aware, is knowing how to find the weaknesses of your opponent. Due to your obliviousness, you might not have heard of a white-collar app called LinkedIn. It’s a platform for professionals, men especially, thrusting themselves on each other. So, Charlotte reaches out to connect. But to who? You guessed right, a scum named Mr Carter-Silk, 57, married father of two and a senior partner at the London office of solicitors Brown Rudnick and most importantly, a senior learned colleague.
Mr Carter-Silk, upon receiving Charlotte’s connect request, replied that he would be happy to connect. He then went on to compliment Charlotte’s profile display picture. He said, in his scum tone, “I appreciate that this is probably horrendously politically incorrect but that is a stunning picture!!!! You definitely win the prize for the best LinkedIn picture I have ever seen.” Then, all hell broke loose.
Charlotte, our lawyer, became furious upon seeing this. She replied Mr Carter-Silk in the harshest of words: “Alex (not Mr Carter-silk, or Dear sir. Just Alex) “I find your message offensive. I am on LinkedIn for business purposes, not to be approached about my physical appearance or to be objectified by sexist men.”  She added, “The eroticisation of women’s physical appearance is a way of exercising power over women. It silences women’s professional attributes as their physical appearance becomes the subject.”
To conclude her venting in her feminist
flourish, “Unacceptable and misogynistic behaviour. Think twice before
sending another woman (half your age) such a sexist message.” It didn’t
stop there.
Even though Proudperson, sorry Proudman was always seen on Facebook posting ‘oooo lalala!’ and ‘hot stuff’ about attractive young men, she took the case to Twitter. Instantly, other women who couldn’t normally recognise a Scum if you gave them as chocolate came to Charlotte’s aid bashing “Alex”. Mr Carter-silk, you Scum of Circumstance.
Ladies, there are many Mr Carter-silks out there wearing the most expensive suits. They present the most charming smile and they wear the best cologne. They’re Nobel Laureate Tim Hunt, who was stripped off his positions because he said, in a lecture, that women in the lab “cry” when criticized. They’re Pastor Adeboye who was lambasted on the Twitter Court by women for saying that he preferred to work with a male secretary. They seem to be the nicest to women while at the same time fall into the easy trap of displeasing women. They also never understand how they became scums. How do you deal with them?
Once you follow this guide, you would be able to deal with them wherever you find them.
1. Identify:because identifying scum is hard, you might need these questions at the back of your mind: is he well dressed? Does he have a good standing in society? Is he respected even by women? They always have this positive personality.
2. Accuse:here, I mean, say something they did to you or to women. Make sure you include the impacts on other women in the accusation. It doesn’t matter if it’s true or false.
3. Use Catchwords:for example, don’t say that he verbally touched you, say that he’s a misogynistic lowlife scum who sexually harassed you with an unsolicited compliment.
4. Know the Words:words like “history,” “you guys,” “feisty,” “man up,” “dramatic,” “bitchy,” “bossy,” “man-hater,” “feminazi,” “loose,” etc. These are all words designed to keep women under. Don’t let anybody use them around you. If they do, it is very appropriate to be feisty. I mean, why can’t history be herstory?
5.Men of God:you see men of God, they’re bad eggs in religious clothing. Don’t you think that if Catholic priests were to meet at Area 51 today, it would be a battle of predators vs. Aliens? Rosary in hand, I touch my forehead and shoulders. Touch not my anointed my foot, God save them all.
6. Make It Trend:always bring it on social media. Always. Women have been silenced for far too long. Don’t just bring it, tag other women. If they shoot shot in your DM, screenshot it and post it with a caption like “just look at this one.” On Twitter, hashtags like #metoo are great. They would help you help get the required audience, enough retweets, enough opinions.
All these men believe that women are just delicate beings. But me? I don’t think so. I don’t think women should be clothed, fed, protected at all. I don’t feel women should be subjected to such domestication mannerisms. Women should be allowed their full rights. At what cost of political correctness? I don’t know. Those men who attempt to say otherwise, claiming it was “just a compliment” or it was a personal experience with females need a lesson on the gender war and third-wave feminism.
You don’t believe these guidelines? I didn’t complete my story. When the smoking became unbearable, I was getting high myself, I reported these “roommates” to the hostel porters. (Yes, I know, I have a long history of snitching.) But when the porters came to my room, they collected Kush well wrapped in rizzler and puffed with the Royal Highnesses.

Nigerian creation story,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-creation-story/,2019-08-27T06:07:10+01:00,"By: Aliogo Chika Eunice
In the beginning, God created Nigeria and sighed.
For Nigeria was without industries and institutions and ideas, and when
God wanted to put those in place, the ‘godfathers’ had adamantly refused
saying, “Things aren’t done like that. A special committee needs to be set
up to investigate why Nigeria was created and why Nigeria needs industries and
institutions before anything can be done.”
A perplexed God went round Nigeria and saw darkness and God said, ‘Let
there be light’, but PHCN said no.
God thought to himself that this must be a difficult country, and so he
made provisions for candles, generators, inverters and solar power panels. God
called the light “Up NEPA” and the darkness “Noise”.
God saw Nigeria was a big directionless land and said, “Let there
be a division”. God called his front North and his back South. When God
saw there was still enough space by his side, he called his left side West and
his right side East.
Once God saw it was good, he gave the divisions a new identity. The
North was to be inhabited by Hausas, the South by Niger Deltans, the East by
Igbos and the West by Yorubas.
God saw that the old divisions were capable of springing forth new divisions and so God let it happen. The North brought forth North East, North West and North Central and the South brought forth South-South, South East, and South West. God saw it was good.
God created states in each new division and each State had its strength
in terms of natural resources, peculiarities and human capital.
The North was in charge of food, the South was blessed with crude oil,
the West had the privilege of education, while the East were rewarded with
industrialists and businessmen. God saw that it was good.
God made airplanes to fly in the sky, boats and ships for the waters,
and cars, donkeys, and cows for the road.
God appointed an Edo woman to oversee the affairs of the sky, an Igbo
man to supervise the affairs of the sea, and a Fulani man to guide the affairs
of the land. God saw that it was good.
God saw that Nigeria needed leadership and so he said, “Let us
appoint a man in our own image that would oversee the affairs of Nigeria.”
God searched and later found a man called Buhari. God appointed him as
President and gave him control over Nigeria.
When God saw that Buhari was lonely, God decided it wasn’t good for him
to be alone. So he provided Buhari with companions and called them Cows.
The Cows became powerful and could stand amongst men. They could own
lands without federal allocation and were social media influencers. The cows
also had a right to eat and live. God saw that Buhari was happy and God said it
was good.
On the last day, God decided to rest. But just as he closed his eyes to
sleep, God heard his name being called from different directions and God
wondered why.
Nigerians kept calling God to fight terrorism, to repair their roads,
to put a leash on cows who identified as dogs because of their companionship,
to provide light and jobs and other infrastructures.
God heaved a sigh of frustration.
Then God said to himself, “Na only me waka come? Abeg I cannot
come and go and kill myself.”
And God left Nigeria and journeyed farther south, and found a new land and God saw it was good. God called the new land South Africa, and decided to have his rest there.
GLOSSARY
Na only me waka come:A humorous statement made famous by former Nigerian First Lady, Patience Jonathan.
Abeg, I cannot come and go and kill myself:A Nigerian expression of surrender and compliance, often spoke out of frustration or despair. Loosely translates to, “Please, I can’t kill myself.”
A girl has a name but prefers to be called Bro by all. A girl knows life fucks people either way, and so, loves pun. A girl loves numbers but idolizes words. A girl is me."
Members of ASUU on strike over concern for students,https://punocracy.com/members-of-asuu-on-strike-over-concern-for-students/,2019-08-26T06:45:46+01:00,"By: Hamzat Mariam
Following recent reports of members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) embarking on a nationwide strike, our correspondent, Kenny Olunloyo, who couldn’t help but take the matter up conceived the idea of a field report which carries the opinion of members of the general public. For her story, she contacted lecturers, students and other members of the public to find out their thoughts on the seemingly unending strike ASUU has embarked on for about six months now.
Meeting up with Prof. Ajelamo, the Head of
Department Political Science and Administration, University of Ibadan, he
further reaffirmed the fact that Lecturers are on a nationwide strike for a 5-point
agenda to be looked into by the Government.
The agendas being- Increase in Scholarship and
grants, payment of stipends, investment in projects, gratifying payment of
salaries, and supply of laboratory equipment to secondary schools. All of
these, the professor believes will make life and learning easier for lecturers
and students if they were looked into.
“Grants and increase in scholarship and
fellowship program abroad will help lecturers and students a lot. It will make
our work even easier. Though we are not suffering, still we do not have to be
“poor and indigent” like some student’s scholarship say to have our
education sponsored. They are simply things we deserve as scholars”. Mr.
Ajelamo expressed bitter regret at how university teaching staffs have been
reduced to pulling strings and applying many-to-one for scholarships.
Another member of the Union, Dr.Owolabi Titus
of the Economics Department Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife explained that
the strike was called for with the type of treatment members of ASUU receive
from the Government. He questioned the reason his salary has not increased
since he had been promoted a few months ago. “I’m not some University
student who labours hard for 4-5 years only to be handled #100 as the cash prize,
simply because it’s the tradition. The Government should look at the current
worth of levels and stop paying us salaries people at that level earned years
ago’.
Meanwhile, a non-teaching staff at the Obafemi
Awolowo University said he could not blame the teaching staffs for going on
strike. The fact that they think to ask for improvement to be made on schools
meant for staff children shows how much they care. He also said that it is for
the best if laboratory equipment in these staff schools are increased, as the
ones in many universities lack and are almost empty. As a laboratory
technician, he advised that supplying staff schools with more laboratory
equipment will go a long way, that way some students will have ideas of
practical which universities do not have the capacity to perform.
On the other hand though, a student who pleaded anonymity said that she couldn’t fathom why lecturers are still asking for gratifying payment when they have gotten all the gratifying satisfaction they need from their students through sex. In her words, she said many of those male lecturers don’t need to go on strikes or even be paid, they get enough from many of their students; it should be their salaries. ‘What about all the books and manuals we are forced to buy because they are simply not compulsory but necessary, don’t they make enough from those?’, she said.
Mr. Lawal, parent to a resh graduate waiting
for his call up letter complained about how much the strike is causing a delay.
Having paid a huge amount to finish his project, his son’s details have not
been sent to NYSC for call up, nor does he have the result to apply for
postgraduate studies. Though Mr. Lawal complained about the strike delaying his
son, our correspondent, found out that the son has taken to learning a trade,
all thanks to ASUU strike.
As at the time of gathering this report,  we are unable to reach the Minister of Education for reactions. However, all indications after talks and interviews show that the lectures are concerned about students. They care so much that they fear being treated as one by the Government.

Meet my country,https://punocracy.com/meet-my-country/,2019-08-26T06:39:48+01:00,"By:Okebunmi Titoluwa Favour
Hello! Meet my country Nigeria,
We are the giant of Africa,
Although, we are trying to plug the fruit of
greatness from the tree that’s just 2ft tall.
We are the world’s number one developing nation
as the seed of glory sown by our heroes’ way before 1960 is still growing.
Meet my people,
Although we differ in tribe, language and maybe
colour, we are one people.
We are one people, one Nation.
Our connection is beyond cords as each tribe
holds the other by the neck strangulating them.
Tell me how can this be divided?
Meet our leaders, my leaders.
They’re from different political parties but
they’re under the same umbrella, the lions and humans here use the same broom
to sweep.
They are not just their brother’s keeper; they’re their sister’s, mother’s and father’s keepers as they keep the sweat of the masses in international accounts.
They play their role perfectly because the
script can never go missing like our budget.
Meet the masses;
They’re always alright especially when they are
settled.
Wage is king: whether minimum or maximum.
They try to maximize the minimum wage given to
them by purchasing laziness, corruption and poverty.
They own “power” but it can be bought with a
packet of matches and 3 yards of Ankara,
With persistent haggle it can be sold at the
last price of sweet words.
Meet our youth; hopefully I’m one of them.
We all have a promising future because we are
lazy.
Our future lies in hope just like akara in
bread, the akara is super safe with the bread’s covering.
Although we try our best to leave poverty and
misery, we can’t betray the hood.
Because inside life lies 5alive; what else can
you ask for.
Scam is a strange word as we don’t even know
the source.
Benz isn’t a dream; it is in the PLUS.
There are more people I haven’t introduced yet
like;
The good guys in black who scan and scam criminals or
The guys whose language is bomb and message is
books should be in everyone’s home.
The guys whose Cow’s net-worth is more than
Dangote’s.
Everyone I’ve introduced is unique and special; their similarity takes crux in the peculiarity of putting their trust in NEPA.
They have constant light.
So can we know you?
My name is Tito, I’m 20 years of age. I am a value communicator; I communicate truths and help shape the mindset through writings, poems and Arts. My desire is to use my pen and pencil to shape people’s way of thinking especially from the archaic patterns sown to our minds by tradition and culture."
Old things shall pass away…,https://punocracy.com/old-things-shall-pass-away/,2019-08-26T06:32:32+01:00,"By: Ibraheem Abdullateef
Kwara’s new Lord and Saviour, General AbdulRahman AbdulRazak (the conqueror of Bukola and PDP), has announced a change of emblem for the state. You may not need to ask for reasons because no single logical one was given. The governor merely wished and the proclamation was made. Thou shall not grumble when the Lord Speaketh.
The Super Governor must be an avid reader of the Holy book. By his recent conducts, I feel he has a big knowledge of the Bible as he has all the while exhibited the traits of a perfect godly Nigerian governor.
The flash of brilliance is inherent. The uncanny ability to pop up at unimagined places, the perfect will to be seen working ( most Kwarans has a gallery for him now), the advancement of Operation-No-Potholes and clear penchant for tourism clearly sets him apart from the last governor within the first three months of their tenure. Asides that, no long-lasting achievement has been recorded. We might need to revisit achievement and accomplishment for proper understanding. However, we cannot deny him tributes for revolutionising Kwara politics. The gentle giant struts his stuff subtly, subtly.
Our Governor has been committed to one particular Biblical
teaching; “Old things shall pass away”. The way and manner by which
he’s repositioning it is worthy of example. From pure ingenious plan of not
assembling a cabinet for good three months to bunking of Sallah celebrations
with his people for other engagement most likely away from Nigeria and now, the
swift changing of the state emblem with no explanations whatsoever, one’s bound
to agree that Kwara’s on a new political wave and old things have passed away.
If you have little problems believing, kindly look into the faulty processes (read shrewd political robbery)  culminating into the suspension of the Council Chairmen. You will see it was the action expected of a godly governor. They were frauds, embezzling state treasury. Especially, the Stubborn four. If you were surprised they were invited for questioning after suspension which they should have done before passing that subtle judgment kindly take a bow and go.
The other 12 have found their way home. May Father forgive their sins. The investigations may exonerate them or even forget them outrightly. Repenting Council chairmen can take a bow. Governance is turn-by-turn. Thou shall not argue with a drunken man wielding a gun. Old things must pass away.
The state’s better run like a business empire. Maybe renaming would do. For leaping productivity. The revolutionising Governor AbdulRahman might have forgotten to reach out to the House. He can visit the dam in the morn, hydro- plants in the noon and see some patients in the hospitals in the evening offering words of encouragement. The documents needing attention on his seats can sleep. The Deputy Governor could attend to them if he’s not attending a party member’s function.
More so, Kwara people need courage to survive not
intervention on health or policy on education which the governor is most capable
of giving as a talker of repute. The photos and the press statements tell the
stories better – the governor with no respite, nor slumber, the people’s love
prevails. Also, the intelligent one. The cabinet might not be needed, they
discuss policies ( and we really do not have one or many) and we might just be
running the government on principle. The old things have passed away.
A man’s face may woo the minds but only a good name enlivens the soul. May my state beget a new name. Her face was never ugly. She was indeed molested by the last husband who lacks empathy and care. But he gave her a good face through a distinct logo which tells the story of the beauty she embedded.  The unification of our heritage and culture in an ingenious logo without ditching the proper steps before the announcement would never be forgotten a gift. Maybe a gift becomes truly special when others envy it for no reason.
But it might not be surprising if it had to make way regardless of its uniqueness and brilliance, for the adoption of an old, ubiquitous national Coat of Arm after all Kwara has a new governor. Therefore, old things shall pass away.
The cost implications notwithstanding, there are little other ways for my governor, our governor, to immortalise himself since ascension. The logo move is one big way to stay unforgotten for a long while till another event overtakes. Or maybe a government.
Something is certain, the inexistent funds might
become available now that our Governor desires a new face for the state. When
you think of printing and branding and all sort of changes needed for the new
emblem you might want to call on God. But do you query God for making you in
his image? May Kwara god remain unquestioned. The servants are pleased. What’s
the economic drive? Will agriculture improve by mouthing diversification? Does
education become quality through body language? Only the opposition elements
will ask, though.
Who dared say there was some vendetta? How they came about such rumour needs to be queried. The recent disbandment of commissions: Kwara State Civil Service, Kwara State Electoral Commission and Kwara State House of Assembly Commission headed by the supposed men of the predecessor (supporters, as we say in Nigerian politics, of previous administration/opposition don’t deserve a space on the table regardless of their brilliance) were taken in good faith.
They have proven to be “misfit for their offices”. Even when there’s no single evidence to back up that claim. And they were never issued a query talk less of been served sack letters. Why take such pain anyways, when they can see the news online. That’s best administrative practice. There’s always a willing House of Assembly ready to deliberate the godlike and godly governor’s request in matters of hours while FOI bill is gathering dust in one dirty House’s desk. It’s no vendetta but setting the record straight. Defeat is not enough. The defeated must be buried. Setting policy and driving the agenda may come second.
Nigerian governor may be everything from brilliant to rich,
exposed and connected to be elected but he must be dirty, insincere and sneaky
to retain his seat. Mayhap my governor learns so fast. Credits to his Bible
study knowledge. To become a powerful (not much for success I think) Kwara
governor, old things must pass away.
But I wish he never learned so.

Please tell me where to keep your bribe?
Do I drop it in your venerable chambers
Or carry the heavy booty to your immaculate mansion
Shall I bury it in the capacious water tank
In your well-laundered backyard
Or will it breathe better in the septic tank
Since money can deodorize the smelliest crime
Shall I haul it up the attic
Between the ceiling and your lofty roof
Or shall I conjure the walls to open up
And swallow this sudden bounty from your honest labour
Shall I give a billion to each of your paramours
The black, the light, the Fanta-yellow
They will surely know how to keep the loot
In places too remote for the sniffing dog
Or shall I use the particulars
Of your anonymous maidservants and manservants
With their names on overflowing bank accounts
While they famish like ownerless dogs
Shall I haul it all to your village
In the valley behind seven mountains
Where potholes swallow up the hugest jeep
And Penury leaves a scar on every house
My Lord
It will take the fastest machine
Many, many days to count this booty; and lucky bank bosses
May help themselves to a fraction of the loot
My Lord
Tell me where to keep your bribe?
My Lord
Tell me where to keep your bribe?
The “last hope of the common man”
Has become the last bastion of the criminally rich
A terrible plague bestrides the land
Besieged by rapacious judges and venal lawyers
Behind the antiquated wig
And the slavish glove
The penguin gown and the obfuscating jargon
Is a rot and riot whose stench is choking the land
Behind the rituals and roted rigmaroles
Old antics connive with new tricks
Behind the prim-and-proper costumes of masquerades
Corruption stands, naked, in its insolent impunity
For sale to the highest bidder
Interlocutory and perpetual injunctions
Opulent criminals shop for pliant judges
Protect the criminal, enshrine the crime
And Election Petition Tribunals
Ah, bless those goldmines and bottomless booties!
Scoundrel vote-riggers romp to electoral victory
All hail our buyable Bench and conniving Bar
A million dollars in Their Lordship’s bedroom
A million euros in the parlor closet
Countless naira beneath the kitchen sink
Our courts are fast running out of Ghana-must-go’s*
The “Temple of Justice”
Is broken in every brick
The roof is roundly perforated
By termites of graft
My Lord
Tell me where to keep your bribe?
Judges doze in the courtroom
Having spent all night, counting money and various “gifts”
And the Chief Justice looks on with tired eyes
As Corruption usurps his gavel.
Crime pays in this country
Corruption has its handsome rewards
Just one judgement sold to the richest bidder
Will catapult Judge & Lawyer to the Billionaires’ Club
The Law, they say, is an ass
Sometimes fast, sometimes slow
But the Law in Nigeria is a vulture
Fat on the cash-and-carry carrion of murdered Conscience
Won gb’ebi f’alare
Won gb’are f’elebi**
They kill our trust in the common good
These Monsters of Mammon in their garish gowns
Unhappy the land
Where jobbers are judges
Where Impunity walks the streets
Like a large, invincible Demon
Come Sunday, they troop to the church
Friday, they mouth their mantra in pious mosques
But they pervert Justice all week long
And dig us deeper into the hellish hole
Nigeria is a huge corpse
With milling maggots on its wretched hulk
They prey every day, they prey every night
For the endless decomposition of our common soul

Becoming a rich Nigerian graduate,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-rich-nigerian-graduate/,2019-08-25T06:24:42+01:00,"By:Aniebiet Philip Effiong
Becoming a rich Nigerian graduate is the dream of every Nigerian student.
In your country, finding a job as a graduate is like finding a needle in a haystack. It is either you become a corrupt Politician, or a fake Pastor to become rich. Or, better still, return from NYSC to learn tailoring or, you get a mini-bus and start hustling.
Are you in need of a cool job that can fetch you cool cash on a daily basis?
A job you can sit at the comfort of your parlour to do without stress?
There are jobs you don’t need to sweat before earning your pay. You don’t necessarily have to carry cement blocks on your head for builders at sites to build a tower, nor sell gala on the street of Rumokoro before we know of how hardworking you are. ‘Hard workor softwork, all na hustle. Na money you dey find’.
Forget what you studied in school. Does it matter?. Afterall a lawyer is the minister of power in Your country. No one is interested in what you studied. Keep your degree. Nigeria is not interested in it.
Here is one of the ways of becoming rich as a Nigerian graduate. First of all, you have to be very smart for your business to be lucrative. You can find one Lagos bred who has Lagos blood in him and make friend with him. Or a boy who bears Chinedu, Emeka or Uche and stays in Lagos. I heard smartness is contagious. Get close to him. Have connections with them. Don’t you know that the only thing that works well in Nigeria isconnection?
Think of one influential or great personality, create an account of him. Someone like E. A. Adeboye would do. This is just a suggestion. The list of revered personalities is endless. Do this using a common social media platform like facebook where literates, illiterates, exposed, unexposed are found.
Download his photos from the internet, use his recent photo as the profile picture. Make sure you carefully browse for his accurate details so as to help you create his profile – this is very important – it becomes a valid account once we see accurate details about him.
Don’t be in a hurry to add friends, especially those ones without profile pictures. Big men don’t rush to add people. People rush to add them.
Keep posting things like ’50 people will have N1m before the end of this month. To claim this type amen’. Wait and see the number of amens you will see as comments within an hour. Nigerians, it doesn’t matter the number of times they’ve gone across such post(s), they’ll still comment with amen hoping for a testimony. They love miracles. A Nigerian God blesses people who have faith. He blesses those who don’t work hard.
You will see friend requests troop in. Most of them, like those whose profile says ‘ Studied at Ghana, Lives in Uyo, worked at student’ will become your gullible customers while some might ignore your business. Never worry, its business, some will patronise, some won’t. When you accept their requests don’t be surprised to see words like ‘tanx for ur acceptation daddy’, ‘thanks for accept my friend request’ on your timeline.
Don’t joke with friends like these, they are the ones with the money you’ve been waiting for. Send messages of blessings and positive proclamations to as many that will add you. Make it as catchy as possible. This will serve as a bait. They will respond with amen. By this, you’ve gotten their attention. Nigerians love prophecies. It works for them.
Tell them you had a vision about them the previous night. By this, they’ll be glued to your subsequent messages. From there you explain to them what to do so as to activate the blessings the Lord had kept for them. Tell them you’re currently running an orphanage home God had entrusted into your hands. Quote some sweet and powerful seed sowing verses from the Bible for them. That verse that says ‘give and it shall come back to you…’ may sound cliche. Don’t act as if you’ve never been to church before; as if you’ve never heard the words your Pastor uses in pulling out crowd into paying their tithes. Remember you’re now a Daddy. If need be, there is google. Make it your friend.
Organise people who will drop beautiful comments of testimonies on your timeline. People who will write how they got healed of their cancer, fibroid and other ailments through your online prayers. Their narrative has to be detailed and touchy to attract other gullible Nigerians.
Never be in a hurry to drop your account number along with the message, I mean the account number of the orphanage home. Just attach the Lagos boy’s phone number below the message. He’ll know what to do when calls come in. Sit and watch the calls come in as you make your cool cash. You are a Nigerian, and this is one of the Nigerian ways of making money.
Note. You have to delete that account once you’re done with that set of miracle seekers. Block them. You don’t need them again.
Create a new account with another name and continue your work. This time, maybe as an actor or as a result upgrader (WAEC, NECO, JAMB). They will still fall into it. All you need do is just change your name. To something like;
Balogun Temitayo
Alj. Mohammed Ibrahim
Names are much. Think of something.
Tell them you work in JAMB office and that you have direct access to the database.
Tell them how to gain admission into a Nigerian University without jamb. Tell them how you can upgrade jamb score from 100 to 280. They will believe you. They love shortcuts. They love miracles. You’ll see them slide into your inbox to express their grievances and sorrows. They will sound frustrated. Don’t forget that the rate of failure this year is high. They want to attend University by force. They think that a Nigerian graduate is a god.
Play your cards well. They’ll send whatever you say.
If EFCC comes knocking at your door, tell them the year you graduated from the University, tell them there is no job in Nigeria. Tell them its what You do for a living, since you can’t turn to a rodent to drag seat with the President, nor become a snake to swallow thirty-six million Naira. Tell them you’ll give them one million naira, then you are free. That is not bribery, you are just settling them.

Let the good works continue,https://punocracy.com/let-the-good-works-continue/,2019-08-25T06:10:15+01:00,"By: Winlade Isreal
As I sign out of office on this memorable day
as the Governor of this great State who brought governance to the streets and
homes of his people, especially in the aspect of giving them quality lives
tinged with happiness, I count it an honour to give a report of my stewardship.
I duly recognize the presence of the Chairman of our noble party, Coalition of Likeminds Against Hunger (COLAH), Representative of the National leader, in the person of Asiwaju Ajani Ezeulu and the incoming governor and delegates from across the states. These delegates are our mouth, ears and eyes at the grassroots. It is because of their timely support in terms of mobilization and sharing of democracy dividends in time of the election that we have successfully been able to secure power to lead this state from nothingness to the next level.
I want to congratulate the Incoming Governor for the divine grace showered upon him to take up the mantle of power. Your era shall be a continuation of the good things we have started as God lives.  The State unlike what we inherited is much stronger with outstanding docile young minds who have constantly cooperated with the government that is determined to give them an avalanche of happiness.
This new-found zest for life is courtesy of our initiative to address the high rate of suicide due to hopelessness in the governing system of the society. To address this, we appointed Mrs. Orji Nnaji to head the Ministry of Happiness while we allocated about thirty-five per cent of our resources to organizing a monthly party where bigwigs of the country’s music industry entertain them in order to divert their keen attention from the reality of the failed system we inherited.
Today, I am happy to tell you that we have a youth population that is less concerned about what some elements with the aim of disrupting the peace of our government say. Though they might listen to them and validate their opinions, they still have an immovable faith that we are messengers from God to lift their burden of poverty. We have been able to assure them that all will be well. If not today, tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then next day. One thing is certain, all will be well one day.
In our own way of keeping our promise, we launched a campaign against hunger by distributing homemade garri and kuli to every family across the state. This cost us over 30 billion naira. Many criticized us for spending such a huge sum of money on food. But they forgot the wisdom of our ancestors: “When hunger is out of poverty, poverty is conquered”. How well can we combat poverty if not by first feeding our people with quality homemade product when we are yet to start manufacturing exotic products like quaker oat, custard and various products of corn and cassava our children like eating?
During our tenure in office, we were able to increase the welfare allocation to each voter. I mean, instead of the N500 and a cup or two cups of rice they received on the eve of elections, we supplied them with four cups of rice, two sachets of packaged 1kg garri ijebu. To save them the stress of spending more money to eat this package to their satisfaction, we decided to add N100 to the usual N500. To secure the loyalty of their traditional rulers, huge cash in dollars was gifted to make them have a taste of how sweet the national cake is in order for us to avoid any likely opposition to the progress of our rescue mission. The result is glaring. We had a massive turnout of voters and that resulted in our victory for the second term in office.
The same welfare package was distributed during the last election and it once again proved to the whole world that the citizens of our state are conscious of their civic duty and also have the required passion to go extra miles to fulfil this duty come rain and sunshine. With well-fed citizens, power is always secured.
Also, we made sure we supported different religious organizations to help our people seek the face of God more than ever. I personally made sure I went to different churches, mosques and even shrines on the day of their worship to prove to them that I belong to every religion and belong to none. In fact, on most occasions, I donated towards the improvement of their standard of worship. In return, I got the support of their leaders and even the people. I even got a vote of confidence from the President of Association of Believers (AoB). He said, ‘‘We shall open the gate of hades over anyone that decides to shut you out of office.’’
All these became our motivation. We continued with the good works on the street. Every street our convoy passed, we moved at slow pace so the people, our people for whom we stay awake discussing on how to spend our resources, which amount to spend and how much to keep for safety in some officials’ account for investment, can wave their hands at us and be consoled with our laughter.
Sometimes, I get down and have a taste of what they eat. I can tell you; we have a great cook on the street. Condiments are just what they do not have. Noticing that I go for checkups after this activity, some people called me a hypocrite. But, how else can I bring my government to the grassroots if not by identifying with the people at the grassroots irrespective of their standard of living? How can I cater for their welfare if not by feeding them better during elections and contribute to the daily income of their children and husband who cultivates their bread on the street by spraying them some fifty naira notes when on parade to their streets?
Your Excellency, the Incoming Governor, I
beseech you to keep up with this culture. These people go through a lot and
need some care. Visit them often and keep them assured that we are able to
manage their resources and get it across to them whenever we visit them. The
dividend of democracy must not be concentrated into our hands alone. They also
deserve some.
We know that it is impossible for leaves to stay stiff in the stern face of breeze. We encountered some challenges. One of these challenges is the fall in the price of oil in the international market. This fall tempted us to totally remove fuel subsidy. But we resisted that temptation. Rather, we borrowed the pensioners’ fund to maintain the economy and paid our workers half salary until the economy becomes stable. Wisdom, they say, is profitable to direct. We hope the next Administration will not fail in the payment of these outstanding pensions.
Also, we went through a series of defense of the state’s image. I give kudos to the commissioner for information. He made sure to always be on guard to invalidate all the negative comments of the international press on the state of the state. One of the lies he had to debunk was the claim that over twelve million pupils dropped out of school. Mr. Mensonge Ajani had to correct their claim. Of course, we have the highest number of children who are not enrolled in primary school due to the increase in the population of children. But that doesn’t mean they dropped out of school. A spade should be called a spade, after all.
After clarifying that, they went ahead to further release a report of their self-acclaimed research on the living condition of the people in the state. I was shocked when I read their report that Oranmiyan state is leading in poverty and poor standard of education. How come they reported poverty and not the wealth of happiness the people enjoy in their daily living? We had to remind them of the biblical phrase that says godliness with contentment is a great gift. Happiness surpasses any material wealth.
Though it might look like our people are poor, internally, they have peace of mind and find their ways through their daily struggle for existence. This struggle does not in any way mean suffering. They just make sure they give the last drop of their sweat to make ends meet. This is what we encourage, hard work!
On a final note your Excellency, the future is
loaded with a lot of lies the opposition would want to sponsor against your
regime. Stay on guard and arm yourself with the breastplate of truth and let
the good work continue. Your people are your people. When the dividend of
democracy comes, remember them.
Long live Oranmiyan state!
Long live the United Nations of Patriots!

How to become a millionaire in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-become-a-millionaire-in-nigeria/,2019-08-24T07:07:42+01:00,"By: Omoya Simult
(Caveat:
Please engage your sense of humour in reading this article. Sentences may have
deeper meanings than what can be readily gleaned on the surface. Or maybe not.)
“If you no get money, hide your face,” sang Davido, a billionaire’s son and top musician. In Nigeria, you cannot be addressed as a respectable human being unless you have money. Of course, when we say somebody has money, everyone understands we are talking in millions of naira. If you cannot conveniently announce at a social function that you are donating a million naira or more for some cause, then you have not arrived, which means you are not worthy of being taken seriously.
Everything in this country is about money. If someone tells you otherwise, look at him closely and you will realise he is a poor man, a struggling good-for-nothing who is seeking for a companion in misery. Run away from such a person before he poisons your mind and pulls you down to his level. You should know the god you serve is a god of riches, and his purpose for your life is for you to be stinkingly rich.
It is
possible that you have heard a lot about how to become a millionaire. Over the
years, it is even likely that you have read a couple of books, attended
seminars, and seen some YouTube videos that discuss this topic. Well, for your
information, so far you are a Nigerian living in Nigeria, all that knowledge is
useless. Nigeria is an entirely different system with its own peculiarities.
Therefore, methods that work elsewhere just don’t work here. Because I have had
a few calabashes of good palmwine and I am in a particularly nice mood today, I
will take my time in debunking many theories you might have considered and,
hopefully, help you see the light. Thus, if this article tells you anything, it
must be this: “I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man becomes a
millionaire in Nigeria but by me.”
(1). First and foremost, you are mistaken if you
think the way to make lots of money in Nigeria is to study a good course in the
university and have good grades. That would be too straightforward, and we
don’t fancy such. The best jobs, the types that can make you a millionaire, are
simply not open for application, regardless of how excellent your curriculum
vitae is. They are reserved for the privileged ones, people on whom the gods
have smiled, so perish that thought already.
(2). These days, one hears of some heady
Nigerian  youths who have the audacity to
dream of making cutting-edge discoveries while in this country, the kind of
scientific breakthroughs that will turn their fortunes around. We must seek
them out and applaud their incorrigible patriotism, evident in their reluctance
to see that Nigeria is at a terrible disadvantage technology-wise. It does not
matter that they might never achieve this lofty dream or that longingness might
weary their souls. They would have tried, but you would have known better. You
would have known better because you would have examined the statements that follow
and attempted drawing a logical conclusion from them. A: Nigeria is currently
the prestigious headquarters of poverty in the world, based on her abundance of
poor people. B: poor people and their government rarely have time to think
about the future because they are mostly preoccupied with how to survive the
present moment. C: technology is the future.
(3). You must be familiar with the latest craze
about entrepreneurship by the federal government and its agencies, and it is
okay to flatter yourself by hallucinating the Nigerian government gives a rat’s
ass about you. However, small and medium-sized enterprises are never going to
cut it, never going to make you a millionaire that you were destined to be. At
best, they are a mere distraction from your goal. To tell you the truth, the
Nigerian government thinks youths are annoying cry-cry babies, so it stuffs our
mouths with any pacifiers that can keep us shut. If you are in doubt, go find
out how many leaders who sing about entrepreneurship have their children do the
kind of start-ups they are recommending to youths.
(4). Lastly, you should know you are kidding if you
think your creativity will get you on the list of millionaires. The next
beautiful gift you are sure to get after your work is released, after a
short-lived acknowledgement of your genius and perseverance, is despair clothed
in a colourful wrapping paper called piracy. In Nigeria, people will pirate
your work, and when that happens, you should be grateful your work was
considered worthy of piracy in the first place. After all, your name is still
out there, going places. It is the same story whether you are an actor, a
writer, a musician, an artist, or whatever. Intellectual property and copyright
are not things we bother ourselves about here; please leave that to the white
man and his pointed pink nose. Because, at the end, only one thing is certain:
you would be convinced you have successfully wasted your time, and this
epiphany would further worsen your frustration.
Having
thoroughly disabused your mind, it is time I showed you how exactly to make
money. In Nigeria, there are but few ways to become a multi-millionaire. If you
follow any of the paths and apply yourself, your riches will come like an
avalanche. Do not worry about moral standards or values. All things are
acceptable and forgivable in this country, provided you have enough money. In
other words, laws are made for the common man, poor people who do not know what
it means to change cars like one changes clothes. As for you, multi-millionaire
that you would have become, you are above the law.
(5). The first and most preferred  means of becoming rich is to become a
politician. Run for a post and do whatever it takes to win. Politics is where
the money is — never
forget that. If you secure a good position like that of a state governor,
deputy governor, speaker, president, vice president, etc, your generation will
never be poor again. The reasons are obvious: one, you can embezzle as much
money as you please. Nigerians already expect that, so don’t disappoint them.
Two, for doing very little, you will be earning one of the highest salaries and
allowances obtainable anywhere in the world. And what’s more, you will continue
receiving some of these allowances long after your tenure in office is over,
basically till you die.
(6). But in the unfortunate event that you are
unable to secure a political office, let not your heart be troubled. All you
need do is become friends with an incumbent politician. There are two ways to
do this. One is to become his in-law. The other is to cozy up to him, which is,
well, a euphemistic way of saying, “Be his bootlicker.” Either of the
two gets the job done. Soon, you will secure an appointment, more like a
sinecure. If none is open, he will surely create some redundant office to
accommodate you. We have heard of such offices as “personal assistant to
the special assistant to the state governor”. Where there is a will, there
is a way. In the probable situation that he doesn’t offer you an appointment,
rest assured that he will be offering you something just as good: a contract,
preferably one with inflated budget, or an oil well. Anyway, remember to pay
your dues; a Nigerian politician likes his kickbacks.
(7). The other path that leads to a
multi-millionaire status is to establish a church. Nigerians are very religious
people, and many have argued that it is because Nigerians are poor. They say
the poorer you are, the higher your tendency to hunger after spiritual support,
something to balance what you lack in the physical world. But that is all
theological and philosophical headache, which, honestly, you should not bother
yourself about. Just start a church that has modern doctrines and musical
instruments. Remember to say God called you or that you received a revelation,
then make sure your public address system and public relations are stuffs of
legend. Preach prosperity because that is a Nigerian’s dream. Validate your
members and bolster their psyche because that would keep them coming. In due
time, extend your tentacles. Set up more branches and build a school. Be
certain your school fees cost an arm and a leg. People will find money by all
means to pay; it is after all a godly school.
Churches
are Nigeria’s biggest establishments. If in doubt, count the number of churches
in your local vicinity and compare it to the number of any other establishments
around, be it public or private. You must take advantage of this. It is just
perfect that churches don’t pay tax, which is why you should subtly encourage your
congregation to pay all their tithes. Fraternise with politicians, but be
discreet about it, for you must not be seen to be unequally yoked with
unbelievers. In no time, you will hear your banker say, “Congratulations,
pastor, you are now a millionaire.” At this point, you must start thinking
like a successful businessman, because that is what you have become. What does
a successful businessman think about? Expansion: more expansion and more money.
Therefore, go ye into all the world and multiply.

How to be American in a Nigerian skin,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-american-in-a-nigerian-skin/,2019-08-24T06:58:39+01:00,"By:Ufuoma

First, you really do not have to visit America.
However, it is an added advantage if you do. Introduce yourself as an American
or someone affiliated with God’s own country. When asked your name, say it is
Amanda even though your parents named you Chimamanda which means,My God
will never fail.Spell it like the English name, A-M-A-N-D-A. Pronounce it
so. Forget that names possess far more meanings than their spellings or
pronunciation in your culture and adopt another name. Forget that your God may never
fail you just on the basis of your name. Wear the culture of a foreigner even
if you have never been to his land or even if you have visited only once on
holiday with your uncle who is not exactly your uncle and then come back home
to yap about how beautiful the Empire State building is and how busy the Wall
Street is.
Speak with an accent. This is not one gotten
from speaking too much Igbo but one from constant and repetitive practice from
watching Hollywood. Spend hours on the internetgooglingAmerican lingo and styles. Do not speak any more Igbo
because it will ruin your developing American accent.
Practice Ebonics. You are black after all and
Ebonics are part of black culture. It’s almost an equivalent of Nigerian
pidgin. So you erase pidgin and embrace Ebonics. Pidgin is for locals.
Ask your friend Chiwendu why she has not
changed her name to Wendy or your friend Oluwatobiloba, why he does not spell
the variant of his name, Tobi as Toby. Speak of America like your great great
great great grandfather was Christopher Columbus. America is your motherland
and the culture is your middle name. Be so proud of Hollywood that you must
hold contempt for Nollywood even if you grew up watching Sam Loco Efe, Osofia
and Aki and Paw Paw with struggles to get the latest video tape from the
nearest rental store. Pretend like you never watchedCheckmateorFuji House of
CommotionorSuper Storyand act
like you only watchedDallas, DynastyandDays of Our Lives.
Most importantly, do not visit localbukas. They are not for an American. Do
not eatFufuandOfe Nsalain public. You are now an American and you must not order
local dishes in public even if you eat them in the confines of your room. Your
favourite food is now Fries and Hamburger and anything that is filled with oil
and cheese.
Do not forget to get one or two tattoos. They
spell the word American. Wear your hair in nice weaves and bring America up in
every conversation you engage in. Let people know you are working on getting
your red passport.  Always recount your
experiences the last time you travelled, if you truly have, and speak of
American history like it was your course of study.
Do not forget to spell your words like an
American. Colour is color. Pyjamas, Pajamas. Manoeuvre, Maneuver. Centre,
Center. Mum, Mom. Say bin instead of trash. Hood instead of bonnet. Trunk
instead of boot. Cookie, instead of biscuit.
Drink Coffee more than tea.
Be very liberal about choices.
Be a millennial. Don’t stick with things that
ascribe to culture and heritage. What is culture? What is heritage?
Say howdy when you see someone. Mind your own
business. Don’t go about snooping in on another’s business. That’s a Nigerian
thing to do. You are African-American.
Don’t forget to listen to American music. You do
not want to soil your knowledge of good music with Nigerian dancehall. You want
good and professional music only. This can only be in America.
Stretch your hair. There is nothing fancy about
wearing your hair unrelaxed. There is no joy in wearing a nappy hair in a trend
Nigerian and other African girls call natural. Natural is what you define it to
be and like an American, you can decide to change your body to what you desire.
Again with the accent, don’t lose it. Stick
with it. It is fancy wearing an American accent. Which American would want a
Nigerian accent? Do not speak pidgin. Do not soil your tongue. Be purely
Americano.
Above all do not forget to add an American flag
to your social media handle. In your photographs, even the ones taken in a mall
in Nigeria, use a good camera and add location as Arizona or New York or
Atlanta.
You are not Nigerian. You are American of
Nigerian descent.
One more thing. Get yourself to America. Far
away from Nigeria as possible. You can then add the Nigerian flag to the
American flag on your social media handles and only then will you attach
Nigeria to your name. This is because at that time, just like the famous
Nigerian actors and Musicians and Writers who have been American all their
lives but Nigerian on the basis of birth, you can claim Nigerian in Diaspora.
It sounds fancy and very patriotic.
Do not bother yourself with the state of
affairs of the country. Represent from afar. Loud it when the country wins a
football game in the World Cup or African Cup of Nations but don’t forget where
you belong.
After all, it is easier to be in love with your home from afar in a home that’s far better than where you were born. Choose your new home. Even if yourepfor certain reasons, it is not your home. Your home is America. Or somewhere in the American continents. This, my dear, is how to be an American in a Nigerian Skin.

"UI appoints student vigilante leader as CSO, renames Abefele spiritual watchmen",https://punocracy.com/ui-appoints-student-vigilante-leader-as-cso-renames-abefele-spiritual-watchmen/,2019-08-23T06:54:20+01:00,"Reported by: Peka.
In a recently released bulletin, the University of Ibadan (UI) announced the appointment of Ms Akinbobola Bibire as the new Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the conferment on the Security Unit, popularly calledAbefele, the title of Spiritual Gate Watchman, since “old habits die hard”.
In a phone interview with the university’s Director of Public Communication, Mr Tunji Oladejo, he confirmed the development.
According to him, “The University Senate reached this decision in a closed-door meeting with Prof. Idowu Olayinka, the university vice-chancellor while deliberating on the recent unfortunate insecurity incidents at Awolowo Hall and Abusalam Abubakar Hall.”
Mr Oladejo said this decision is to tell the public that the University is not sitting idle and carefree.
He further explained that the watchmen, better called prayer warriors, are to combat insecurity spiritually, while the female student CSO and her squad are for the eye-to-eye physical combat against the dreadful bandits.
According to the report from the University Senate, as disclosed by the PRO, since female residents have lately been at the mercy of the armed men in the two consecutive attacks, “donning the females with the whole duty of providing their own security is paramount at this point.”
When asked what the university means by “old habits die hard”, Mr Oladejo explained that, “The armed attackers at Obafemi Awolowo and Abdulsalam Abubakar Hall saw the security men praying during both incidents and not on physical but spiritual guard.”
“Since clergymen on campus are on indefinite sabbatical leave, praying during traumatic events is habitual of security men in UI; and as we all know that ‘old habits die hard’, the senate’s decision is to make their spiritual business on behalf of UI thrive well rather than their original physical business,” he stated.
According to him, “This will help balance the spiritual and physical ends of security measures in the university, as the new CSO and her team compliment the prayer warriors’ efforts.”
However, in an interview with Ms Bibire, the newly appointed CSO, equally Obafemi Awolowo Hall Chairperson, she expressed her gratitude to the university senate for deeming it fit to leverage on the trending #RevolutionNow movement to turn the security tide of the tertiary institution by her appointment. According to her, “The decision is too revolutionary to fail” considering its two dimensions (2D), that would consistently and effectively manage UI security system.”
Furthermore, she said following her appointment as the University CSO, “The previously proposed inter-hall defence committee, which includes student marshals from every hall of residence, has been set up and consequently commenced their ‘Bang! Bang!! Bang!!!’ work.”
She commended Mellanby Hall of Residence security marshals’ efforts, saying “a job well done to their midnight “Bang! Bang!! Bang!!!” in a quest to find strangers in the Hall.
“The Hall is taking the lead,” she said, “as their motto reads, in the commitments to setting halls of residence free from the captives of insecurity bedevilling the university.”
In addition, she said some residents of Awo Hall, who were robbed of their properties and left injured and at the mercy of the armed men over a month ago, have been equipped with whistles, “making them the most courageous whistle-blowers in the country lately.” According to her, Awo Hall residents “are taking the front, as whistleblowers, in protecting the university community.”
With the mentioned efficient security measures and others planned but yet to be disclosed ones, she thus assured that “there is no cause to be alarmed; you can sleep soundly in the storm” as she, the master of the storm, is in the ship, they cannot be capsized.

How to be a Nigerian gay man,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-nigerian-gay-man/,2019-08-23T06:28:31+01:00,"By: Obinna Tony-Francis Ochem
Dear Nigerian gay man, have you ever thought about how to be a gay man in a homophobic country like Nigeria? A country where your human right is denied for hurting nobody? Oh, I was quick to forget you are a menace. A menace that should be eradicated anytime sooner. I forgot that a Nigerian Twitter account once said homosexuality is the cause of insurgency, killing, economic recession and other happenings in Nigeria. His tweet got a lot of likes and retweets. Don’t you know everyone can’t be wrong? You are really threading a wrong path.
So, spare my initial goof, I forgot you are the main problem bedevilling this country. You need to abandon your immoral act for this country to blossom. What’s the essence of doing what’s retarding this country? Don’t mind Americans, what worked for them can’t work for us. We are Africans and our root must be upheld. Don’t you know we are known for our masculinity? Nothing should tamper with it.
Why would you even choose to be gay? I know you chose this lifestyle because you wanted to appear woke, chase clout and do other abominable things. People have been trying to trend on social media for being woke and you definitely don’t want to be left out. You are the problem with this society. You, feminists and atheists. Without you, this country would have been great. Imagine your audacity? You are now raising shoulder pads with God.
You know I’m among the few people that like you, so I have come with a piece of advice for you on how to be a Nigerian gay man else you’ll risk being imprisoned in a cell for fourteen years. Fourteen good years in that dilapidated building. Don’t be unfortunate. I think this advice is coming from the deepest place in my heart.
— Become a homophobe. Whenever you hear your friend discussing homosexuality, try to make your voice heard. Tell them how irritating it is and how those that engage in it will burn in a lake of fire. Talk loudly. Allow your voice to be more audible than theirs. Ask them why a man who sees beautiful women everywhere, would still sleep with another man. Even if your statement is being thwarted, still talk. Talk. Everyone is on your side. By that, no one will suspect you are gay. They will tell anyone that becomes suspicious about you how you loathe gays.
— While you loathe them, don’t forget to make
lewd comments about how you’ll smash that beautiful girl out there. Describe
her anatomy in vivid details. Tell them how women’s breasts are round and
bobbling. How their butts are perfect and how their lips are luscious. If you
can gesticulate well, round your hands and show them how you’ll sleep with her.
Don’t forget to be a misogynist. Bash women. Bash them. Have them only as a
fuck mate. Don’t be too soft on them.
— If you audition for big brother Naija and get lucky to be chosen, don’t go there and be secluded to yourself. Be like an average Nigerian man. Have sex and grope women on a daily basis. Don’t stick to only a woman. Show them that you are a bad boy. When the show ends, continue trying to impress everyone that you are a straight man. Show off girls on your Instagram page and on your Instagram status, upload videos of yourself caressing girls. Don’t forget to be addressing women as bitches.
— When you are interviewed and asked about your
opinion on LGBT, say they are the problem in this country and quote biblical
verses you have memorised to support your assertions. The LGBT activists will
only get mad and cause uproar online but most Nigerians will love and praise
you. They’ll tell you how you are God’s gift and won’t care if you are smashing
a girl and closeted homosexual. Don’t support ever support LGBT. It’s the worst
sin. Nigerians will wish you heaven’s gate and tell you how you are the best
thing to happen after Jesus.
Thank you!

A certain Nigerian highway,https://punocracy.com/a-certain-nigerian-highway/,2019-08-23T06:19:27+01:00,"By: Moghalu, Jennifer Chinwendu
He threw his big, mango-shaped head back in
satisfaction, heaved a heavy sigh and squared his shoulders as he made to take
his seat adjacent to mine. His gait and choice of clothes reminded one of his
ancestor warrant chiefs’ during the British colonial period in Nigeria. His
eyes which were fixed to the ceiling got a different interest. It was the Front-Page
Editor’s seat. Often, I had caught him sitting on it, swinging from left to
right. With eyes shut, he often muttered things to himself. He wanted the seat
by all means. It is well known that he is the only person in the office amongst
us reporters who has bagged a master’s degree. He strongly believed that the
highest corporate position and all respect should apart from the Publisher go
to him.
He was a known snub. But today was different.
When our eyes met, he smiled at me for the first time ever! For my ‘good
morning’, he gave me a resounding reply. We were all shocked and tried to
ascertain what was wrong, we were sure something was, but he just smiled and
nodded at us.
Minutes later, Ossai cleared his throat loudly to draw our attention. His seat was closest to the entrance. He circled his stomach with his finger to represent a huge belly. It hit everyone at the same time. The Managing Editor had arrived! Apparently, no one had heard him drive in. Kayode, the sports editor who earlier on had his legs spread out on his desk brought them down pronto. Sochima, the new intern who was leaning against the photocopying machine while waiting for the papers to emerge from it stood erect immediately, standing taller than the five-storey building that was adjacent to ours. I was afraid she would hurt her neck. She stuck it out way too much, her head hitting the ceiling that was about eight feet high!
Everyone else adjusted to a different position,
heads engrossed in papers or the computers before them. The buzz in the
atmosphere quietened down, leaving only the depressing sound of the old,
in-great-need-of-replacement, put-me-out-of-my-misery loosely hanging from the
ceiling.
He entered. Chief Dr NPK Okike-Orakwue, Bsc.
Msc. Btt. Llb., Llm. PhD. The man that has attained the highest level of
education. Of course, that’s why he often asks me to spell everything for him
and can’t converse in English for any more than three minutes before he
switches to his mother tongue.
As usual, his stomach led the way. Amarachi, the office messenger, often teased that the future of Nigeria was enclosed in his stomach. He called the shots and he knew it. His giant strides told a lot. His about 4 feet 2 inches height doesn’t deter him, neither does his overweight size. He often took pride in his huge stomach. It was evidence he has been eating well, unlike most unlucky and poverty-stricken Nigerians.
We greeted him in unison. ‘How do you all do? Amarachi, take that fan to the highest point it can get to. You all need to work in a good working condition because nothing else would suffice’. He is a good man. Of course, he cares so much about our working condition. That’s why he always demands extra funds from the Publisher to make improvements and refurbish our Editorial department section. Amarachi promptly did as she was instructed. Nothing changed with the in-hell-fire heat in the small room that we found ourselves in as staff. Just one thing became more intense, the destructive sound coming from the fan.
Chief, as we normally refer to the Managing
Editor, called for me as soon as he settled down in his office connected to
ours by a passage. What now? It really was too early for him to make me run
errands for him. Amarachi was our office messenger though. Whoever sends her to
get anything is in safe hands. Because, she will go back and forth for at least
five times before she even gets close to getting exactly what was demanded for.
And of course, she is most honest and trustworthy, that’s why money keeps
disappearing from people’s bags each time she comes in contact with them.
He didn’t call me for errands’ sake, at least
not in the way I thought. News had emerged and we needed to get more
information about it. Following the huge profit we made after publishing the
unfortunate event that took place at the Joint Admission and Matriculation
Board  Office when a stupid and in-need-of -home-training snake had
swallowed about 36 million Naira, Chief thought it would make sense if we also
gather information and publish a similar story that trended currently. A
gorilla in a zoo in Maitama had swallowed a bag containing about 6 billion
Naira. He hoped that huge profit would also come from this one.  I
concluded immediately that both the snake and gorilla must be related somehow,
seeing that they eat the same kind of food, Money.
I set out with some of my colleagues in the old and out-of-order 500 thousand Naira worth van, that chief had procured with the 3 million Naira provided by the company. The president was on the news as Okechukwu, our driver put the radio on. I shut my eyes as I tried to make out the things he was saying. He was stressing the importance of “one Nigeria”. His English was very good. Definitely, that’s why it sounded more like the Hausa language. I could imagine the amount of saliva emanating from his mouth to cover the faces of the audience close to him as he addressed them.
Our president is indeed a superhuman. He is rumoured to not have any school certificate thereby making him ineligible for his position as the president, but he managed to secure the position and even has a PhD holder as a subordinate vice president, wonderful! I opened my eyes again as the serene voice of the newscaster came on. She had moved on to another news. The President of the Independent National Electoral Commission, the body in charge of conducting elections in Nigeria, has been heard say that the INEC had no server for the recent general elections in the country. He also promised that elections all over the country was free and fair. Of course, what he said is true, that’s why about 3 million was allocated for election server before the election was conducted. Also, why on earth did electorates pour out on the street to protest against the disenfranchisement and election violence they experienced in their polling stations during the elections? They must be delusional!
We hadn’t gone that long a distance when we heard the first explosion. The second one followed immediately. The vehicle was out of control. We all went into a frenzy. Everyone around me went into prayers. Silas went ahead to call on the gods of his forefathers to forgive him for failing to return to his village to take up his role as the priest of a certain deity seeing that he is the only surviving male child. Women are of course a weaker sex and inferior, his sisters wouldn’t suffice. Prosper, another intern with us, prayed for our deliverance from Boko Haram insurgents. He was sure they had planted a bomb in our van for publishing a story recently, calling for the world to not forget the rest of the Chibok girls and others (mostly Christians) kidnapped and are yet to be found. This is amidst claims of totally wiping out the terrorist group in the country.
The vehicle finally stopped, it had run into a pole. We alighted in a split second. The driver couldn’t because his leg was stuck to something and would not budge. He also appeared to have hit his head against something, thick red blood oozed from an open wound on his forehead.  The accident occurred because both the front tyres of the vehicle had exploded. We raised our voices in glee to bless our boss for providing such a wonderful van for us.
I collected myself and moved to the van to grab
my bag. With the speed of lightning, I brought out my phone and dialed 911. I
told the woman that answered our emergency and she promised that help will come
to us immediately. A few minutes later an ambulance appeared as medical personnel
ran out to help us, handing us blankets while the others tried freeing the
driver’s leg. They took him into the already waiting helicopter and made for
the hospital.
I looked at the driver’s face. He had turned white. It had been four hours since we called for help. Nobody has shown up. Nobody would stop to help us. We weren’t in Los Angeles but a certain Nigerian highway!

Where are Nigeria’s best brains?,https://punocracy.com/where-are-nigerias-best-brains/,2019-08-22T06:43:57+01:00,"By: Francis Olamide
The way Nigeria is losing her best brains to other countries is alarming, at least for me. Some well-meaning citizens have said it’s a sign of surplus productivity. Or what do we call it when a nation starts exporting her best hands abroad?OrisirisiNigeria-born Britishkinikan, Nigeria-born Canadakinikan. Don’t even talk of Nigeria-born Americans,they plenty pass Atlantic ocean. In fact, there is no way Mr Integrity will list his achievements in 2023 without mentioning, “We successfully scouted for many of our best brains that have been abroad.”Sebiit’s an achievement, at least to the ‘sai baba’ compound.
Aunty mii, Abike Dabiri is always the chief announcer of their names and feats. She’ll be like, “Our commitment to improving the image of Nigeria internationally continues. I’m happy to tell you that under this PMB administration, 10 Nigerians won a scholarship to study in the UK.” Excuse me, how does that reduce the price of garri in the market?E dakun, how has it reduced our number of out of school children?
Let Lagbaja win a contract in Dubai, it’s an achievement; as well as when Mr Tamedu wins a scholarship in Canada.
Thank God Baba has told us to leave this country if it is no more habitable for us. Leave it for Baba, it’s not by force. The more we are, the more headache we’re giving Baba. Maybe Baba was trying to copy his US counterpart with that statement; the one that constantly enumerates the number of jobs he provides every month and how he has improved the standard of living of his people. The one that congratulates graduates in his country, encouraging them to go on to be the best they can be because he has created the enabling environment.
But Baba told some University graduates earlier this year that a degree doesn’t guarantee a rosy life. It is just the beginning of the struggle. Baba was using one corner eye to tell them, “E fee kuu, suffer go tire you.” Baba could be right because he himself was a graduate—at leastgraduate na graduate. Especially a graduate whose O’level results are directly delivered to his residence. Awon special candidateniyen. Let’s not even go there today.
Baba is very much concentrated on washing the country clean of corrupt people. Can’t you see how he chose those he personally knew as Ministers, despite the pressure from outside?
Why will the best brains stay in the country full of opportunities and reward for success… opportunity to be a member of the world poverty capital nation and handsome rewards for undignified labour. Can’t you see how huge the prize and recognition for the best graduating students of our Universities are? Presentation of a mug, two thousand five hundred naira is a bonafide reason for any reasonable student to face his studies as Baba is facing Nigeria, isn’t it?
Is that not what you people said? That too much money or recognition for our brightest minds will get into their head and will not make them achieve more?

For the South East Western Poles,https://punocracy.com/for-the-south-east-western-poles/,2019-08-22T06:22:38+01:00,"By: Frances Ogamba
If you live in the South East Western Poles of
this large Black Country, you must watch out for when light clouds cloak the
sun, or when the night wears the clearest skies, for it must be in such hours
that the horrors will rain down on your Poles. These men, the headsmen, will no
longer infiltrate your villages and towns through the forests trying to wreck
the insides first before taking on the shells. They will ram into your lives
through the highways, flag down taxis and winnow the women from the men. They
will laugh into your faces and tell you to call Jesus names. If you do not, the
universe and your faith will fail you.
If you live in the South East Western Poles, it
is important to defend government decisions: LUGA, the importation ban on milk,
proscribing the Shi’a. Do these on your timeline and in your tweets. The
headsman sees. The headsman remembers. And on the last day for the people of
your Poles, on the day preceding the night you will last drink beer at late
nights on the streets of your town, the headsmen will throw you a glance and
smirk in recognition and whisper;this
one may be from the South East Western Poles, but he defends our cause.It
will not matter that you are Ola or Ibiso, you will be safe.
If you live on these red and white sands of the
South East Western Poles, your church may be targeted on the birth and the
death memorials of Christ the Saviour. Bullets will be planted in the church’s
walls, and bodies filled with holes will litter the grasses. Women will scream
and scream until someone with a voice of steel will demand for stillness. This
has happened in Ayer-Mbalom of Gwer East, in Guma and Gwer West, in Ebete of
Agatu, in Nimbo of Uzo-Uwani. It thrives now on the highways in your Poles. It
draws nigh.
At first, it will trend on twitter and sit
within the confines of hashtags, then the tweets will fizzle out and the
country people will move on to newer things, to #AFCON19, to the news of fresh
death tolls, to #BBNaija, to the news of kidnaps from the South East Western
Poles, to feminism and homophobia, until the dead start getting a pitiful shake
of the head and shrugs as last respects. There will be massive protests on
Facebook, and brilliant posts will be shared, transcending e-walls and
e-borders. The eyewitnesses will report seventy fallen, and the media will
report thirty casualties, and the police will report twelve dead. Names of the
dead will be mashed into numbers: sixty, forty, twenty, sixteen, and then downplayed
to eleven, six, two, and none.
We are not aware of
any attacks on the South East Western Poles.The
Delta is largely a safe place. The militants are responsible for sacking the
villages,the Police will say.
We have captured and
executed three hundred terrorists from the bush,the Army will say.
The people of the
South East Western Poles must learn to accommodate these people. Nigeria
belongs to everyone,the Federal Government will say.
There will be protests in Canada and America
and Germany, in cities where the metro functions, in lands where the constant
electricity and water and internet and medical care exceeds its demand and the
comfort inspires in many cases, boredom. Citizens of the South East Western
Poles (and sometimes, the North) with skins bleached caramel by the weather
will converge in pleasure parks in the company of penguins and lament the
events back home in the Poles. They will use rapid English to describe the hurt
and shame they feel, and then fill their speeches with pinches of Nupe or Gwari
and Kalabari or Izon and Igbo or Esan, dialects long neutralized by the many
years of living away from the Poles. They will go home right after the protest
and turn on heaters and shut out the gusts of snowy wind and say “it’s
fourrrrr, not five” to their toddlers and snuggle to their wives, grateful for
their safety, relieved that the din of the chaos drums thousands of miles away
at the Poles.
Aljazeera will film displaced children and
singing women and it will seem like a war, like the Biafran years, only it is
not. This time, it is the headsman, the khaki wearing militia who has been on
his feet for long, moving and conquering borders until he marches into the soft
targets.
The years will be forGodandAmenandback to senderandGod forbid. There will be tithe paying to remain safe at first, and
then there will no longer be because many jobs will be shut down, hence no
salaries. There will be prayers as will always be, the torrent of pouring out
our hearts to God will never cease.
But now, this is where it begins ― the residents of the South East Western Poles are unaware that the big politics players of the South East Western Poles will support the foreign milk ban; that the cows will serve milk to all the Poles; that LUGA will bring the milk closer by bringing the cows closer by bringing the cow headers closer to the South East Western Poles. The residents of the South East Western Poles are ignorant of the armed militia multiplying on their shores, erecting camps in their forests. The residents of the South East Western Poles are rather content to go on twitter and asksco pa tu manaa?And chantBrown skin girlwith Blue Ivy.

Becoming a privileged Nigerian,https://punocracy.com/becoming-a-privileged-nigeria/,2019-08-22T06:17:21+01:00,"By:Mazpa
Ekejiuba Ejikem
Start off by becoming a man! It
is the ticket to the heaven of Nigerian privilege. Even before you are born so,
the sperm cell which you will eventually come to represent must force your
father’s hands into taking a second wife if the first
has given him only useless girls for children.
When you are born, you will hear
the voices of family and friends distort the delivery room and sing of how you
are hairy and wide-eyed, just like your father. This is after he proudly
declares that his child, finally, has a larger clitoris than his other
children.
By this, you will know you on the
right path.
The first thing about being a
man, is learning to hate the colour pink. For you, it must be taboo.
As a man, fix your mind, instead,
on manly things like playing Table Soccer in dirty places, and even more manly
things like doing backward somersaults on sand heaps. Play with soldiers too.
Toy soldiers, I mean. And when you are a bit more motivated, shoot at other
boys with tree branches that look like guns, and fall and ‘die’ when you are shot at.
Of course you know you must never
cry. Not when you are being punished. Not when you are broken (you aren’t even allowed to be), or when the doctor sticks a needle
into your buttocks. Because men don’t cry.
When you are asked what you would
you want to be when you grow up, your tongue must never lead you into saying “A nurse” or “A
Fashion Designer” or any of those professions that
would make you appear feminine. Instead, inflate your chest and say that you
would be a Soldier or an Engineer (preferably a mechanical one).
Rule of thumb: A boy mustdofootball. Even if you do notdoanything else, you must sit or stand
in crowded spaces where deep voices rant about how skilful or appalling the
players can be while watching the UEFA Champions League. You must try to play
football too, no matter how terrible you are at it. The more you play, the more
points you score on the test of manhood.
Forget Scrabble and Volleyball.
They are for your little sisters, and other women who do not realise that they
should spend their time grooming themselves for their marriages to you and your
likes.
Oh! And speaking of women. You
must love them. Even when youreallydon’t or when you simply don’t.
Just try, or better still, pretend that you do. You must do this by turning
your neck and smacking your lips when they pass by, making sure to be seen
doing it. If nobody sees you, you must draw attention by saying something like,
‘Dayuumm!’ Stretch the word
like that. And say it loudly.
Indeed, most of your mind should
be dedicated to women, money and weed. And if by some rare chance you have a
little more brain space, consider video games and hip-hop music preferably by
Jay Z, Joe Cole or Burna Boy. You must not be caught nodding to Blues or Soul
or Lady Gaga or Beyoncé. You will be written off as weak.
Be warned, you must notlikeanother man! You simply cannot. But
if by some sort of unfortunate and inexplicable mistake you do, you must never
show it.
For example, do not hug another
man with the whole of your body. A transient and careless brush of shoulder
against shoulder will suffice so you do not transform into a woman.
Do not greet by saying ‘Hello’ or ‘How
you are you?’ in a gentle manner. It is not the way of
men. You must raise your voice, crudely, and start with, ‘My
man!’ or ‘Nigga’ and then go on to ask, reflexively, ‘Wetin
dey sup, man?’ or ‘How far,
man?’.
Take note of how English isn’t spoken amongst men (except the other man is your father).
Take note of how you must always
remind the next male that he is a man, or at least supposed to be, by adding ‘man’ to every sentence. If that
would be too boring, replace it with ‘bro’. It sends the same message.
Also, you must not say, to
another man, ‘I love you’ or ‘you smell nice’ or some of those
things that might suggest admiration, without adding the panacea, ‘no homo!’. If you fail in this
regard, you will automatically become a gay man, and believe me, that is not
good.
If ever you want to lose whatever
privilege you might have garnered, then consider eating Ice Cream or Yoghurt
when you go out on a date with yourself, or anyone else. The world will look at
you with blatant suspicion and ask you if you did not know that beer or rum
existed, or something a little more caustic. And if you cannot justify your
actions (and trust me, you won’t be able to), you might
find out that your penis is missing, because you probably do not deserve it.
Remember, as soon as you
successfully assume a position atop the pinnacle of unadulterated manhood, and
you have begun looking down at the women and lesser men below, then you must
consider making money. Because you are the man. And you have to get married (to
a woman of course), and poor men do not get married in Nigeria.
I should not remind you to be
smart. To choose between the criminality of Nigerian Politics, which is
essentially the easiest way out of poverty, if you can play the game well; or
the criminality of cyber fraud. Personally, I would advise the former, for
obvious reasons.
The All Progressives Congress is
a good place to start. Forget the fact that there is nothing progressive about
them. The most important thing is that they are in power, and so you will most
likely get some cake. When it seems difficult, or your place at the dinner
table feels threatened, jump into the Peoples’
Democratic Party, or whatever new coalition that might have been formed. What
does it matter? The political parties have nothing to do with ideologies.
Rather, they are associations formed based on the common interest of pocket
infrastructural development of its members to the detriment of non-members.
But pretend you do not know this.
When you are settled. Run. Run
for Governor or Local Government Chairman. Run, because you are a man. Who
better to fill up executive public offices than one who bears a penis?
You might win the elections, and
you might not. But if you do, stand before all the people you have successfully
deceived and thank them, just after you have thanked God.
And yes! You must thank God in
all that you will do. He must be invited to take the front seat of those
meetings where the money set apart for the Health Insurance is siphoned. After
all, the Health people say that women and children are most affected by poor
health care. And they aren’t men.
In case you are stupid enough to
think that the Nigerian politics might not fetch you bread, or truthful enough
to admit that it isn’t your sort of thing, and you
really are in need of a Mercedes Benz and a Baby Mama, then pick up a pen and
paper and write out the following needs: A Laptop Computer and/or a cell phone
(preferably an i-phone; the security is better), a social media account, like
Facebook and Instagram, or an account with one or more of those dating sites,
and, of course, some foreign contacts. Round Chinese women won’t
be bad. Neither would older retired Americans. All those pale-skinned people
are potential clients. You will probably hear that they are all daft, and have
no brains. This makes them most useful to you. And so for them you can be
anything – man, woman, trans, gay, lover, professional,
businessman. Anything but yourself. They will send you some hallowed foreign
currency after you have told them that you own a huge-ass company in South
Africa and Lagos, or after you tell them that you cannot live without them.
See how I wasn’t
in a hurry to suggest formal education. Here, that is no good. You cannot spend
all your time sitting for and failing JAMB and WAEC in order to get into the
moribund tertiary institutions while your mates – men
like you – sit at home and ‘blow’.
After all, in your country,
privilege is defined by a rich, apparently straight, man.
But remember, if, somehow, you fail at getting rich and being, or pretending to be straight, I urge you to be consoled by the singular fact that you are a man, and therefore sooner than later, everything will fall in place.

91 Million poor Nigerians call for being remanded by SSS to enjoy El-Zakzaky’s kind of large living,https://punocracy.com/91-million-poor-nigerians-call-for-being-remanded-by-sss-to-enjoy-el-zakzakys-kind-of-large-living/,2019-08-21T11:18:37+01:00,"ABUJA —Nigeria’s 91.8 million poor people,the world’s highest, have sought a breakaway from their miserable condition. They have called for being kept in SSS detention like Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, the embattled leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), also known as Shi’ite.
El-Zakzaky had revealed in Indiain a videothat he is living large in the SSS detention where he has been since the 2015 in spite ofcourt order to see him free.
“I have been about four years in prison now, [in] a house fully furnished,”El-Zakzaky had said with gusto. “In fact, our next neighbour was the senate president; a large house. I was free to move about. Similarly, when they moved me to Kaduna I was in the best area – government reserved area.
“It is a house fully furnished with large bedrooms and I was free. I have never been in detention with police there; in fact, the soldiers used to stay outside at the gate. That is what they have been doing. When we came here we were put in prison.”
More so, according to the nation’s former minister of information, Lai Muhammad,the country monthly coughs out N3.5 millionto feed El-Zakzaky’s mouth alone.
By contrast, these luxuries are far from the reach of nearly half of those who call  Nigeria home. These massive number of people are, therefore, looking for means to better their lots.
Making the call on Wednesday, Ciroma Adekunle who briefed pressmen in Abuja on behalf of everyone who live below a dollar per day said they have seen that the president’s promise to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty is unrealistic.
“Instead,” Adekunle demanded, “we want the president, through the State Security Services, to acquire a court order to put us in their custody. We have seen that being in SSS detention guarantees food security, life security and all other luxury of life which is the fundamental responsibility of every responsible government, including freedom.
“We all saw how El-Zakzaky was flown to India for medical treatment. We also will like to be given similar treatment. Since our healthcare centres are the number one patient that needs treatment, it will be good feeling to see all of us flown abroad for treatment whenever we are sick.
“Meanwhile, we are all sick. Among us you will find the world’s highest number of people suffering from a disease or the other. Just name it,” he paused, trying to shield a cough forcing its way out of his throat. He then continued by saying, “For this, we are calling on the federal government to grant our wish since living in SSS detention guarantees better life than living as destitute outside.”
Our correspondent who watched the address on INEC server asked to know for how long the detention should be. Adekunle retorted: “Until we can wake up every morning and say, ‘God bless Nigeria’”
Research has shown that the only people who are not among these group of poor people are those who have held one political office or the other, and those who “hustle”, legitimately or otherwise, and their hustle has “yielded” (or clicked in local parlance).
Nigeria is the world’s headquarter of poverty, many research further tell us, because only gluttons who are skilled scavenging resources for many all to themselves have been allowed to govern the land since independence.

At eleven years old, you find the tongue of your tutor between your lips, his fingers on your little buds, his words in your thighs. You find his eyes taped to your body or his body taped to yours. Dear, it is your fault for making him feel that way. Why do you look appealing to him, huh? Your body turns into a door for him because you sit with him on the same table to receive lessons, [why didn’t you sit in the living room while he teaches from the dining table, you silly little attention-seeking whore]. You smile at him like you smile at everyone [because you are a girl and girls have to smile always —now why do you smile at him seductively?]. But you know, you are the dictator of his actions towards you. You are a child, he is a man — Mr Lucas is a good teacher with a wife and son and he always says that he wants a daughter like you, may God in his infinite mercy bless his soul. So why on earth do you want to ruin him? Liar! You just want to stop receiving lessons because you are lazy. He is a good man…
II
The priest invites you to his office on a Wednesday evening, he wants to give you a prayer. He gives you on the floor with your naked body and his half-naked body, grunts and a hungry dick. But you call it rape, shame! How dare you? Even if he raped you, he is human, a man in fact. And men like this, they are always horny. It is how God created them. Doing the Lord’s job is tough; so “touch not my anointed” even if they threaten to kill you. Next time you visit a man of God, whether it is a Pastor, Priest or Imam, wear all the layers of clothing you possess and make yourself look unattractive.

There are bruises everywhere,
broken bones in you, fractures, blood, a black eye because your husband does
not like that you disobey him. Because he does not like that you search his
phone all the time and find evidence of his intrigues; so he hit you, and it is
okay. It is okay because men are violent and angry creatures. After all, you
always consider their only emotion to be anger and there is nothing you can do
about it. Don’t you know you should not do such things to men? You only provoke
and make them hit you more, one day you may even die during a cold stone
session of receiving blows to the head. But don’t worry, if you are silent your
marriage will be fine —this is very essential for a woman. Your mother went
through it, your mother-in-law, your grandmother, and everyone’s mother went
through it. Have this at the back of your mind, “there is light at the end
of every dark tunnel”. Your silence will be heard by God eventually so
don’t you dare leave that marriage, a divorce is not an option. How about your
kids? And your title as a grown mature married woman? Do you want all that to
go down the drain? No? Lovely. Try not to yell at your husband, do not search
his phone, allow him to visit other women whilst praying for him to come home
and kneel for him always, wash his clothes, feed him, clean his shit —men love
a humble and submissive wife that is equivalent to a slave. Sooner or later he
will love you back. Amen.

A man makes snake noises at you but you ignore him. ‘Ashewo’. That is what he must call you, ‘ashewo’. Of course, it is your fault for getting insulted in that manner. Even if you do not ignore, ‘ashewo’, if you do, ‘ashewo’, if you get raped by him, ‘ashewo’. Because your trousers show the shape of your hips and ass, because you chose to reject his advances —if you like, continue rejecting the men that come your way, by the time your vagina and uterus expire after three decades of your womanly life, you will die single with no children and husband to live for! Remember that your ultimate aim in life is to marry and reproduce, forget the degrees, forget the jobs, forget your ambitions. Just look for a man and you are successful. ‘Men will always be men’ and when they want to fuck, they fuck, even when they fuck in a very trivial way, just manage him and earn yourself a ring.

Let me be frank with you, the Nigerian man; the logical gender, head of the home, protector and superior overlord of the masses and sometimes woman; neck of the household, inferior gender, helper, the less intelligent and emotionally disgruntled gender, have said all these are your fault. Who are you to object? If you are a victim of sexual abuse, it is your fault and you are to blame, so suck it up and deal with it. You are alive, breathing and existing hence, you have yourself to blame for the things that happen to you. This is a man’s world and nothing must disrupt its balance.

How Buhari could deliver Justin Trudeau│Tunde Asaju,https://punocracy.com/how-buhari-could-deliver-justin-trudeau%e2%94%82tunde-asaju/,2019-08-21T06:00:26+01:00,"If you want to raise compliant citizens, keep them least educated and block the education of travelling. Those who think that patriotic dinosaur Sai Baba is infallible are right. I would never be caught dead criticising my president. Allah’s choice makes no mistakes, criticism is treason and age comes with incontrovertible wisdom. Don’t ask Methuselah who got only one sentence in the Scriptures for living longest while young King Solomon littered our sacraments with bites of wisdom in all his acts.
I bring you corruption tales from Canada, a country that; Insha Allah would re-evaluate its luck when Naija citizens return to queuing for ‘essential commodities’ as Sai Baba’s cutting of foreign exchange cuts to the bone. The era of people who did not vote for Sai Baba just walking into neighbourhood supermarkets to buy what they need is dated. No more indiscriminate foreign imports and that include foreign medical trips. El-Zakzaky wasted the last voucher.
Canadians are spoilt rotten! They have a handsome prime minister that they insult daily. Early this year, a minister appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refused gestures to be lobbied to give a judicial soft-landing to a Canadian company – SNC-Lavalin, accused of bribing corrupt officials to do business in Libya. The Minister in question, 48-year old Jody Wilson-Raybould leaked the gesture and later resigned. Ingrate eh? I thought so too. She flatly told the man who appointed her that she felt uncomfortable carrying out her boss’s orders. Justnegoduthe insolence!
The prime minister denied anything is wrong and tried to paper over the cracks. The woman continued to grant press interviews and even honoured an open bi-partisan parliamentary hearing. Rather than get dropped into the bottomless pit of political oblivion, she continued to attend caucus meetings until someone had the balls to fire her.
Canadians have no EFCC and the RCMP does not take executive instructions to hunt and hound quondam friends of a ruling party. Caveat! No Naija party official should ever be allowed to visit Canada as they could be infected with this virus to treat presidential body language with disdain. Nobody who has attended Canadian law school should ever be appointed Attorney General as their refusal to enter a nolle prosequi could bring the office of the president and any cabal in control to disrepute. Nobody who has lived or schooled in Canada should ever be appointed into public office as they could reward those who nominated them with the plague of conscientious objection.
Anyway, Wilson-Raybould resigned and one of her friends followed her on principle. The prime minister had to accept the resignation of some of his closest fixers. In February, the Ethics Commissioner, our equivalence of Ibrahim Magu announced an official investigation! Imagine Magu investigating and indicting Buhari. If Sai Baba asks Magu to jump, he would do atsallethat’s higher than a Masai doing theadumu.
August 14 Canada’s privacy commissioner, Mario Dion released a damning verdict indicting the Prime Minister and vindicating Wilson-Raybould exactly ten weeks to new federal elections. Conservative and liberal talk show hosts have been on the overdrive, inciting Canadians to reject the Liberals and embrace regime change, alleging that Trudeau has changed the change he promised.
Methinks somebody should send the profile of these talk show guys to Lanre Kawu of the NBC to be AIT-ed! I mean, state-owned CBC, Canada’s version of NTA and FRCN, gleefully calls this one scandal too many! Insolence writ large you would say. I strongly recommend that Canada’s Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, CRTTC should be retrained and refocused by our NBC officials to avoid civil war. If they refuse, then Buhari should send evacuation planes to Ottawa and other Canadian cities to bring all of us back before we are corrupted. Naija cannot afford to breed independent-minded malcontents who support people that insult and abuse their elected leaders on air without repercussions. Sowore is learning the hard way that democracy is not about that.
Justin Trudeau says he was only saving Canadian jobs. If SNC-Lavalin had been indicted, it might have closed shop and sacked over 9,000 workers, half of them in Trudeau’s home riding of Quebec. Imagine that. Trudeau says he vowed to protect Canadian jobs and has nothing to apologize for, but his critics say he should. Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu have urgent consultancy contracts here.
We could do with a Trudeau as president whenever Sai Baba returns to London to rest. That way Trudeau might realize that being leader elected by the people is not something to toy with.  The fastest route to jail is to openly oppose President Buhari. IG Wala only wanted to test Buhari’s anti-corruption stance by announcing alleged corruption in a parastatal headed by a Saint Buhari when he earned 11 years in jail. It was okay for Lai Mohammed to call for a revolution, but in the mouth of Omoyele Sowore, that is a 45-day treason holiday in reformation camp. Abubakar Idris got ‘kidnapped’ for writing against ineptitude, double standard and corruption in government. Tinubu could park bullion vans in his house on Election Day sans reproach, but Atiku’s lawyer and son-in-law are facing money-laundering charges for not running $2 million through a ‘financial institution. This is how we fight corruption.
Sai Baba has lessons in governance to teach Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. As a consultant, I’ll waive my consultancy fees to make the connection. I’m patriotic like that. Good bosses need a wand in authoritarianism.

Marital rapists are like bras; here’s why you should love them,https://punocracy.com/marital-rapists-are-like-bras-heres-why-you-should-love-them/,2019-08-21T06:00:10+01:00,"By: Ayodimeji Ameenat
Like bras, husbands who rape their wives only have a goal; to show their women love and give them the greatest pleasure. Every pain it causes is irrelevant extra and that can be overlooked.
Besides, a woman who abandons her bra because it makes her uncomfortable is weak but maybe it’s just that she has other bras in her closet. She would most probably cheat on her husband and leave him in the marriage because he’s dogged about performing his primary duty— the duty of making love to his wife. Abi, should it even matter if she wants it or not? Isn’t a duty a duty? Acting like she doesn’t want it doesn’t displace it as the best and most affectionate way men show love, and you all love it.
Iamdumb.com defines ‘strong’ as being able to live with pain, hurt, discomfort and losing the ability to move on. My girlfriend should be strong. You can’t let your homegirl throw away that peng bra on an it-makes-me-feel-slightly-uncomfortable-on-the-inside kinda excuse. For Pete’s sake, she looks perfect on the outside and isn’t that good enough to keep it on?
A bruise down there isn’t painful; it’s pleasure on a Kama Sutra level. A husband giving such to his wife should be branded the best inbedmatics. Moreover, his intentions are good and she’s his lawfully wedded wife— not the hoe from the broth’ at 3rd street.
When you buy that beautifully expensive lace bra that’s often outta stock at the mall, you lose your right to complain that it makes your claustrophobic boobs feel caged.
Such cage is after all beautifully patterned and classy expensive. Abi what better purpose should it serve when you’re married to the fine, handsome, rich, every girl’s dream kinda guy?  He is a complete gentleman out there and you know it. You see how he treats the ladies at the supermarket and how he helped the old lady at the airport. You don’t expect him to be all gentle to you too, he is a man; isn’t it enough that he shows it out there?
He has urges and you gotta let him satisfy them. You should be grateful that Sadé at Zone 4 doesn’t tickle his fancy even with your stretched marked belly of four pregnancies.
The bras that cause aches are the best. You get to think of them the whole day. They’d linger in your mind and remind you that nothing beautiful came easy. Forget that wearing a bra makes you all sweaty, it still gives you the lift you need. Your husband too lifts you up. He assists your career, buys you flowers, and take you on abroad vacation. The only thing is when he’s horny, he’s a monster, but still treats you well every other time. That’s a good signal. It means he still loves you as much as he used to. At least, notrealfacts.com says 80% of ladies don’t know the way to a flower shop and only 10% of ladies can survive without their husband’s support, and you know you ain’t part of the 10%.
Marital rape is consent rape. You signed up for it at the marriage registry. You even got a certificate. You should be happy and frame it up for display, so the single girls out there would know you ain’t their mate. I’m sure you wouldn’t want the certificate withdrawn, it’ll speak bad of you. You’ve consented, let him through even if you don’t feel it, moan to it and savour your breath in it. Your will won’t stop you from enjoying it even though it burns a little. Be the strong woman and own it. You’re a wonderful wife. Be proud.
Write an article and title it ‘The nitty-gritty of a lasting marriage’. Brag about it. Brag about how you got crowned a queen and how the dark lids of your eyes were from the silent battles in bed, of rods and sacks and the drizzle in between. Tag your conquest ‘girl power’ because it fits.

A day in the life of a Kafayan legislator,https://punocracy.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-kafayan-legislator/,2019-08-20T06:00:32+01:00,"By: Obi Joy Ogechi
“Honourable members
of the House, let’s have some quiet, please.” The speaker of the Kafayan House
of Representatives pleaded as he banged his gavel for the second time that
morning.
“Mr. Speaker, that
particular shade of red looks great on you, you should always wear it.” Mr.
Okopo, the Honourable member representing Dani constituency pointed to the
prominent lipstick stain on the collar of the Speaker’s shirt as other members
burst into raucous laughter. “I am glad that some of us, like Mr. Speaker, are
doing all they can to advance gender equality in our great country, one woman
at a time.” Mr. Okopo continued.
There was renewed
laughter directed at the person of the Speaker. Not only was he a bachelor, he
was notoriously known as an unrepentant womanizer so the lipstick stain could
only have come from one of the society women or prostitutes (he did not
discriminate) he spent the previous night with.
“Very funny, Mr.
Okopo.” The Deputy Speaker of the House said with not a single trace of
laughter on his face. “Order please, Honourable members of the House of
Representatives shouldn’t be seen behaving like traders in a marketplace”. He
continued.
“But we are traders,
Mr. Jedi, we trade inBills.” Mr.
Chomi, the Honourable member representing Lambo community said to renewed
laughter from the House. “Hear, hear”. Someone shouted from one of the seats at
the extreme.
“If the Honourable
members will kindly give me a few minutes to introduce this bill, we will be
done with the day’s business in a very short time.” The Speaker pleaded again.
The house quietened a bit, just enough for the hum of the outdated Air
Conditioners in the building to be heard.
Mr. Speaker began, “This is the first reading of aBill To Pay All House Of Representative Members The Sum Of Fifty Million Naira Every Year Upon Retirement As An Annual Retirement Benefit. This Bill, if passed into law, shall have a retrospective effect. This Bill is proudly sponsored by our very Deputy Speaker of the House, Mr. Jedi”.
There was a moment of
such utter silence in the building as if the members were observing a moment of
silence for a dead comrade. Members of the House turned to look at one another,
their faces bearing different expressions of joy.
“Mr. Speaker, this is
a very important Bill” Mr. Okopo began, breaking what was turning into a very
long silence. “I believe I speak for every member of the House when I say I
commend the Deputy Speaker for looking out for our welfare. However, I suggest
an additional Ten Million naira every year on Healthcare.” Another round of
“Hear, hear” and other vocal expressions of agreement came from the members who
had come alive once again. Some were so full of excitement, they were banging
on the armrest of their seats.
“I agree with what the Honourable member representing Dani constituency just said.” Mr. Chomi said as he stood on his feet. “Lawmaking is a very tedious process that has a lot of ill effects on our health. I mean just last week, I was coming from my residence to this place to contribute my quota to nation-building and do you know what happened? The 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser I was in broke down some streets away from this place. The motor mechanic who goes everywhere with me tried all he could to get it started all to no avail. I didn’t want to use the other cars in my convoy because they are not befitting of a high-ranking member of the society like me, so all the while my mechanic was trying to work his magic, I was standing outside under the scorching sun. I could have died from the Heat Stroke.” He continued solemnly.
“Sorry oo” A member
down his row commiserated with him while another said “God forbid, it’s not
your time.”
“What if I was hit by
a careless driver?” Mr. Chomi asked rhetorically warming up to his tale. “Or
hired assassins shot at me? I propose an extra Ten million naira on security.”
“I support him.”
Niko, the youngest member of the house said raising his hand to emphasize that
fact.
“I have a
contribution to make.” Said Ekete, the eldest man in the House of
Representatives. He remained sitting as he had claimed in the past that he
couldn’t stand or walk without his walking stick. “Retirement benefits are not
at the top of the list of the problems we are facing as a country. There are
other problems that outrank it. At Fifty million naira per lawmaker annually,
we will be doling out billions of naira which the country has to borrow and I
don’t need to remind the house of how large Kafaya’s debts are. What we are
called to do is serve the populace not get rich off…”
“Very sorry to
interrupt…” The Deputy Speaker Mr. Jedi cut in, not looking sorry at all. “I
don’t remember you, Mr. Ekete, ever rejecting any of the allowances and
entitlements due to you as a member of the House of Representatives and this is
your fourth tenure as the Honourable member representing Lete constituency.
Your constituency is the worse in the whole country, gullies and mud slides
caused by erosion and bad roads and for sixteen years, you’ve not done anything
to lessen the plight of your people. Permit me to say that you are not in a
position to talk about rendering good service. This is a case of the kettle
calling the pot black.” There were nods of assent from most members of the
House in support of this line of reasoning.
“Moreover, what do people who are standing
very close to their graves need retirement money for?” Niko asked.
“Are you referring to
me, young man?” Mr. Ekete rose from his seat and asked, his body quivering in
anger.
“If the shoes fit…”
Mr. Niko fired back.
“Are you the one who
will kill me?” Mr. Ekete asked again advancing towards Mr. Niko. Some members
of the house who were sitting beside him held onto him to prevent that while
some other members of the house restrained Mr. Niko who had also risen to his
feet. Others were watching the unfolding exchange with keen interest.
“He didn’t mean it,
Mr. Ekete, please calm down.” A member entreated.
“I meant it oo!” Mr.
Niko shouted. “If he likes, let him not be calm. At this rate, it is a heart
attack that will kill him.”
“It is you who will
die of a heart attack!” Mr. Ekete cursed. “You will not live to be seventy-five
years old.” He cursed some more.
Suddenly, there was a
loud thud. Something long and black fell from the ceiling and landed in the
middle of the fracas.
“My friend,na snake be dat oo!” A member shouted as
he took to his heels. The gathering scattered as everyone scampered for safety.
There were shoves and pushes everywhere. Mr. Niko left his prized Apple IPhone
XS Max behind and Mr. Ekete ran without his fancy walking stick, surprisingly
very agile for a seventy-five years old man.
Mr. Chomi ran out of the building, ran past his driver who was staring at him in open-mouthed amazement and ran past the security men manning the gate of the House of Representatives complex who were staring at the Honourable Members in bewilderment. It was only when he was outside the fence enclosing the House of Representatives and other ancillary buildings that he stopped to catch his breath.
“Chei!”he exclaimed, “The race to preserve one’s life never ends.”

Why Sowore is detained for his own good│Tunde Asaju,https://punocracy.com/why-sowore-is-detained-for-his-own-good-by-tunde-asaju/,2019-08-20T06:00:29+01:00,"The ever considerate and benevolent President Muhammadu Buhari has sought and obtained a warrant to detain Revolution exponent and Sahara Reporters chief executive, Omoyele Sowore, for 45 days in the first instance. Before fellow revolutionaries start shoutinga luta continua; victoria ascerta, let it be known that Sowore is detained for his own good.
We should be grateful that Buhari is a converted democrat. In 1984, General Buhari would have drafted an overnight decree exclusively for Sowore’s brand of sedition and backdated it before throwing him into Kirikiri or Gasua. Anyone disagreeing with such Supreme Military wisdom could have been fixed. I am not saying that the 9th Sinnate of failed rulers would have denied their political grandfather a wish for accelerated hearing of a bill to that effect, but there are judges willing to do democrat Buhari’s bidding.
Our hard-working Irrational Assembly is on a well-deserved recess, having screened 43 ministers in waiting. They are pretty tired that they need the break. It was not until my gym instructor asked me to raise and drop my arms ten times that I realized how tedious it is to clear a ministerial list in record time while distributing committee leadership. It takes 34 muscles to lift an arm, imagine the number of times (Dr.) Lawan dropped the gavel before the deed was done. These loyal legislators need more pay.
People berate the condition known as ‘bow and go’. But it takes about 100 muscles to make sounds. Animation students know how hard it is to make pictures move. Let us pray that our indolentpolitriciansreturn with sufficient energy to deliver Nẹs Lẹbù.
Sowore and his fellow revolutionaries may not understand how lucky they are to be so benevolently detained. It is unsafe walking lawfully around Naija. Such natural actions happen after binding and losing. Buhari is a saviour. He has saved Sowore from sudden death. People in thehabroadthink that America is safe. Sowore’s DSS detention saved him from being the target of two deranged Americans who went on the rampage in El Paso and Dayton, killing 22 human beings. Yes, Sowore operates from New York City, he could have been shopping at Walmart last weekend. Let us thank Sai Baba for taking his freedom but sparing his life. Nobody ever got killed in El Paso who was in DSS detention; kí a má rí!
Habroadpeople slave for dollars, binge on burgers only to buy tickets to visit home to say life is valued in America. We knew what happened to Trayvon Martin. Although America is not at war, this year alone there have been nearly 300 mass shootings in Trumpcountry leading to as many deaths. They count it with gusto. We don’t count our misfortunes here. That would have made the witches happy and scare willing investors.
If Naija people know how dangerous it is to live in thehabroad, they’ll never queue at any foreign embassy for a visa to sudden death when it is cheaper to die and be buried at home. Dying in thehabroadis a luxury reserved for those with the capacity to return home stowed in an ornamented box stowed in the belly of a plane.
Our Ministry of Funny Affairs should issue a travel advisory to all patriots who have heeded General Buhari’s charge to Andrew not to check out but to ‘stay here and salvage it together.’ It would read like the fake one circulating on social media with little amendments.
In view of the unsavoury incidents in Europe and the Americas; the proactive government of General Buhari, ever conscious of its duty to bury its citizens home and abroad, issues this travel advisory.
That anybody who chooses to travel to any part of Europe or Trumpcountry do so at their own risk. There are high risks of being mauled on the streets of New York, shot in El Paso or gunned down in Dayton. Gun-loving Trumpians like Naija herdsmen are very likely to pull the trigger without provocation but there are more guns in America than there are people. Trump’s nuclear arsenal is enough to blow up the world five times and nobody is sure if in a moment of sheer delirium he would not press the button believing that white people are immune to nukes just because they made it.
You are warned that going to Europe is not a good idea seeing that Britain, the Queen’s land has been locked in a battle to opt out. Europeans caused two world wars and they could do it again when Britain exits.
By the way, why leave Naija where death is cheap, at homes, on the road, in the streets and everywhere and cemeteries are fresh and yearning to go and die in thehabroad? Stay home and die here. Those who flagrantly discountenance this travel advisory are warned that no planes would be dispatched for their evacuation. The one that Buhari’s minister launched is a mere horse on paper; it does not fly.
To be forewarned is to be forearmed.

Allegory of a dying nation,https://punocracy.com/allegory-of-a-dying-nation/,2019-08-20T06:00:03+01:00,"By:Marvellous Kolade Abe
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to inform you that a man called Nigeria is critically ill and dying. He is lying lifeless in earth’s intensive care unit. In fact, his grave is currently been dug in history’s timeline and the pallbearers are ready to bury him out of the history books as soon as he goes the way of all flesh.
Why is Mr Nigeria sick?
Why is he on admission in earth’s ICU?
Mr Nigeria had the best of childhood; he was indeed born with a silver spoon and he had all the potentials, talent and desire for greatness. His cells were active and hungry for elegance and fame. His friends and contemporaries were envious and jealous of his skills and abilities, his superiors were frightened at the rate at which he achieved his developmental milestones.
When people saw the boy called Nigeria, they saw a future world leader. He had no congenital defect; neither was he diagnosed with any childhood killer disease. His future was set to be indeed bright and sunny. Well, so they said.
In the incipient stages of Nigeria’s life, he had huge goals and aspirations for himself. He wanted to be like the big boys: G7, G20, member of the security council of the United Nations; he looked up to them as mentors and role models, took delight in their swagger, confidence and composure. He wanted to have control; he loved to call the shots too like they did.
Young Nigeria craved for the atmosphere, aura, air of the United States, he wanted the colour and flavour of Europe, and he was desperate for the alluring and handsome looks of Great Britain. How he ended up with the looks of an inebriated ape will be discussed shortly.
So what happened?
Why is Mr Nigeria dying in the ICU at the age of fifty-nine having achieved nothing throughout his existence despite all his childhood aspiration and potentials?
Trouble and danger began to brew on the horizon when Mr Nigeria started feeding on an inferior diet of tribalism, nepotism and religious intolerance while he was eating these things, he was heard saying ‘Na something go kill black man’. It was discovered that these diets were entirely cooked with the ingredients of ignorance, mediocrity, selfishness and self-centeredness.
Alarm bells began to ring when it was discovered that Mr Nigeria body lacked the essential vitamins of common sense, creativity, knowledge, critical thinking and innovation; there and then vitamin deficiency began to set in showing various forms of debilitating symptoms. It was said that when young Nigeria was supposed to take the vaccine for unity and strength, he fled!
Then the real trouble touched
down!
Mr Nigeria’s cells mutated, giving rise to a stage IV cancer called corruption that will not respond to any surgery, radiation and chemotherapy administered by Dr. EFCC, an infamous ‘self-acclaimed’ corruption cancer specialist—how he manages to maintain his licence to practice is still a complete mystery to everyone.
Nigeria was also diagnosed with a chronic and necrotic form of terrorism which was as a result of a long-lasting infection of insecurity that defeated the antibiotic of the military forces in single combat in a well-resounding manner. Mr Nigeria’s immune system became compromised so much that his body now became a host for any kind of pernicious cell. The last straw that broke the camel’s back was when Mr Nigeria’s stem cell, which was supposed to develop into a future healthy cell, decided to metamorphose into a malignant tumour which will later be named internet fraud, popularly known as “Yahoo Yahoo”.
It was noticed during a diagnostic test that these stem cells were screaming the word ‘Benz’ as they changed form.
Due to this deadly and devastating diseases, Mr Nigeria’s systems and organs broke down. His essential systems: Educational, Health, Transport, Finance, Electoral systems all broke down, not long before his arms and organs of government followed and failed.
Now, Mr Nigeria is currently surviving on the life support from the WORLD BANK, IMF, UNICEF and WHO. The entire population of healthy cells and tissue are either leaving or dying. The prognosis is really bad and he is running out of time.
Can Mr Nigeria ever recover?
Can he ever become healthy again?
Yes, he can, if the cells of Mr Nigeria’s body agree to undergo an advanced, aggressive and radical form of immunotherapy in which they are going to be triggered, stimulated and sensitised to fight the dead cells and the chronic infection killing their host. They will have to take a stance against the marauding viruses infecting and destroying the various systems of their host. And if they decide not to, we can start preparing for the burial proceeding of Mr Nigeria who let everybody down.

A non-negligible guide to becoming a Nigerian pastor,https://punocracy.com/a-non-negligible-guide-to-becoming-a-nigerian-pastor/,2019-08-19T06:00:55+01:00,"By: Raphael Francis
Forget about being called, who cares?Calling ko caller ni. Don’t you know you can call yourself? After all God said in 1 Peter 2:9:But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
FIRST, you must be ambitious. It’s very important; even the Bible says you should dream dreams. Find a befitting name for your business venture, note, Jesus must be included in the name even if it ends in INC. Something like JESUS CHRIST THE WARING CHARIOT INC, JESUS CHRIST THE STORM ENDER INC. But you still have inexhaustible options. Be creative. Make it attractive. Something like MIRACLE VILE; FAME GROUND ASSEMBLY etc.
You need to have a good command of the English language. No need to ask why, it’s an added advantage. Don’t forget to play with rhymes too, it makes your theatrics more poetic. A pseudo-Anglo-American accent would do the magic, fake it, call God “Gahd”, it’s more flowery. Mind you, you don’t need a degree to attain this. A Nigerian sheeple will bow to you with or with no degree. It’s what they do. It’s why they’re what they are.
You need to have an attractive name, yes! it’s
important, don’t be a drab. If you have one long boring native name like
mkpoikanke. Change it, yes! Change it to something more exotic or rhythmic like
Ransom Thompson or Joshua Peter’s. If you come from a family like mine or have
a domineering father that insists on keeping your birth name. Be creative,
shorten it. Change it into something like this: for instance, Temitayo Balogun
Joseph to TB JOSEPH. Imoh Bokime isong to IB isong.
CHOOSE your area of speciality, don’t be a jack
of all trade, master one. There are inexhaustible options like:
Prophecies
Miracles
Salvation
Prosperity-gospel
Propagation of The Word etc.
Choose prosperity gospel; the Nigerian sheeple are gullible enough to buy into your deception. They just want to get rich overnight because the Nigerian God blesses people who don’t work hard.
Note: Your prosperity gospel must go hand in hand with miracles and prophesies, stop asking how. Stage something. Get a brother on a wheelchair. Make him stand. Make sure he’s a good actor. Or a sister to testify with a doctor’s report about a fibroid that disappeared instantly when you laid hands on her. They will believe you; who questions a doctor’s report these days anyway?
Now you’re ready for the main business. Get a hall, a canopy. Come on be lucrative. Start something. Start off in a primary school. A seven days power pack encounter with the lord will do the magic. Don’t be discouraged if the turnout is not much, haba! Take it easy, Rome was not built in a day, have faith the Nigerian god is faithful, He will bless your Hustle. During the second day of the crusade, you’ve to be dramatic if your sheeple must follow you, must I tell you that? You should know that seeing is believing. Perform wonders, work miracles, give them something to take home. The incredulous your performance, the larger your congregation.
Sell something; your sheeple needs something blessed by their Papa: a talismanic object like stickers that would ward away evil spirit and also serve as accident proof when placed on their vehicles. Sell to them table waters, but give it exotic names like WATER FROM THE SPRING OF THE SPIRIT, tell them it will cure all kind of ailments, AIDS and cancer inclusive.
Then on the last day of the crusade just sit down and listen to testimonies, you will be amazed at what the Nigerian god can do.
Don’t be surprised when you hear that the mere
placement of your sticker on a spoilt refrigerator brought it back to life. Or
just adding a little drop of your holy water made two cups of rice turn four.
This is just the beginning, you haven’t even seen any gullibility yet.
You have many choices now, either lease a hall
or start building one. The ministry must move to the permanent site, that’s why
seed sowing and tithing should be your anchor point. Back it up with Malachi
3:8-10, there’s also Leviticus 27: 30-32; Even Acts 4:34-35. But you must be
careful, there are some parts in Acts 4:34-35 you shouldn’t read to them
especially verse 35, that part that saysand distribution was made unto
every man according as he had need‘. Don’t worry, they won’t bother to
check, after all if you want to hid something from a black man (Nigerians) put
it in a book. Moreover, they believe everything Papa says.
Now you must marry, it’s always glorious to
stand with your wife in front of the church poster smiling honorably with the
title ‘Pastor and Pastor Mrs’ then under it boldly written ‘HOST’ or ‘FOUNDER’.
Moreover, your sheeple needs a mummy figure.
By now, you should have a church App where your sheeple can pay their tithe, offerings, and make donations electronically at the comfort of their homes. It’s very important, don’t forget. Go national, establish a branch, get televised, a daily, weekly or monthly devotional is a necessity, have one.
Begin acting like a deputy God, but don’t overdo. The Nigerian god is a jealous type, he might make your church collapse and you know what that means. Give countless prophesies especially about one political figure or party overthrowing the other come next election. Then sit back and watch politicians run to you for prayers with bag of money. No need to use Bible now, we’re in a digitalised world, get an iPad.
You need to compete with your contemporaries,
increase your auditorium to a million capacity, outshine them. Own a
university, the Nigerian god will tell you a befitting fee to be paid, if
anybody opposes you, use your authority as a deputy god and lay curses on them.
Don’t forget you need a private jet, it’s your gateway ticket to get listed on
Forbes. Get one.
Then seat back with your potbelly and regale yourself to the doings of the Nigerian God.

A proposal for an instructional manual on practising religion in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/a-proposal-for-an-instructional-manual-on-practising-religion-in-nigeria/,2019-08-19T06:00:43+01:00,"By: Moyosore Sheriff Quadri
With the recent persecution of
Religious leader and general good guy nudoiB obniyotaF, it is sacrosanct to
remind the Nigerian public of their place. After all, Christ was persecuted so
we men of God do not have to suffer anymore, touch not the Lord’s anointed
regardless of how he touches you, your body is a temple and religious leaders
are the keepers of the temple.

representation of the state of religion in the Nation.

The growing distrust of the so

Religious setup needs to be curbed. A man of God should not be subject to the
same rights as a regular man. The Bible inHebrews 13:17states “Obey your leaders and submit to them, for
they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give account.
Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage
to you”.
Submit.

"Vehicles, roads vow to “revolt” against lawmakers’ plan to purchase SUV",https://punocracy.com/vehicles-roads-vow-to-revolt-against-lawmakers-plan-to-purchase-suv/,2019-08-18T12:33:29+01:00,"LAGOS —In what seems like season 2 of the silenced #RevolutionNow protest, the Coalition for Automobiles Right, CAR, has vowed to “vehemently revolt” against the plan of members of the red chamber to purchase Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) for themselves.
CAR made this known in a public address by it members in Lagos on Sunday.
Micra, the group’s spokesperson, opened the address by explaining that the plan to revolt trails the move by the nation’s upper house to gift each one of its 109 senators N50 million worth of SUV — an amount that totals N5.550 billion, more than the 8th assembly’s N4 billion haul for the same purpose.
He said this move became particularly necessary to save the face of the country’s automobile industry, and “the condition of their numerous customers across the country.”
More than this, he adds, the report that the senate will not bepatronizing local automobile firmsis “a no-no for us.”
“It is just unacceptable for us. How do we grow our locally made and locally driven members? It is unheard of to know that the legislators want to contribute to the growth of other countries at the expense of investing in us. For us, we will not let this “bow and go”; we will vehemently revolt against it.”
Asked if they are aware calling for revolution could fetch them charges of treasonable felony, it was Keke Maruwa that spoke this time. “We are not afraid of any charge of treason that might come with this. We are ready for any outcome.”
“Nothing stops our lawmakers from buying cars made byInnoson,” Micra continued. “That is the way to promote our own. If lawmakers cannot do this, then public fund should not be used for such plan. We will like to see senators ride our members too. It will be a thing of joy to see senators invest in us. Charity begins at home.
“Should not representation be by service? The poor people that ride us too deserve more. Using the taxes they pay to fund such expensive gifts will tell on them, and in turn, tell on us.”
Similarly appalled about the lawmakers’ plan are roads across the country,which report has shownhave been potholed massively since they last received a facelift.
“We see it as a misplaced priority,” the roads wrote in a joint statement. “What is the logic in buying such expensive number of cars without improving our condition? It is like as a leper who, rather than seek cure to leprosy, chooses to buy expensive and exotic clothes. Does that make sense to anyone? We believe lawmakers should be more reasonable than this.
“We will push back at this move. That will be our own way of revolting. But if they insist on going ahead with the plan, we will use our many potholes to deal with them. We will contract beneath their tyres. We will make their vehicles to somersault. They had better not travel through us. If they have ears, let them hear.”
The move by the senate to purchase SUV for its members joins thelong list of outrageous allowancesthey have always pocketed.
The allowances of the 469 legislators of both houses are equivalent to the yearlysalaries of 191, 954 civil servantswho receive N30, 000 minimum wage.
Reports suggest that, although Nigeria’s lawmakers are the highest paid in the world, they are the best example of how not to legislate.
Lawmakers are currently on recess. They will resume September 24.

A few notes on governance in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/a-few-notes-on-governance-in-nigeria/,2019-08-18T03:49:13+01:00,"By: Modupeoluwa Abidakun
Congratulations on your election into office. Let me begin by stating that your primary focus while in office is your reelection. This should be your paramount priority, as serving the people and other sweet nothings you promised during your campaign only come second. Here are a few things to keep in mind, so you have a smooth ride.
ON HUMILITY
There’s nothing the masses love more than a
humble, rich man. They may forgive a murdering, corrupt politician, but
haughtiness is one of the deadly sins and they will not tolerate that. So
remember to perform intermittent public acts of humility. Be seen going to
construction sites, conversing with builders and even working with some cement.
Make sure you take pictures that’ll be in the newspapers. Let your wife be seen
frying plantain with roadside traders. Simple things like a picture of you
eating corn will endear you to their hearts, and they will not cause you much
trouble.
You should employ an official photographer as
this will make things easier for you.
ON WORK
Ensure you carry out a few projects, but just
the barest minimum as if you show them that you can do lots of things they
might start to demand too much. Also, if you provide good amenities what will your
campaign promises for the next elections be? You need to think about the future
and cannot afford to be overzealous. A certain governor did his work, and now I
hear the citizens are demanding electric trains. If you go ahead and make good
on a lot of your campaign promises, you are on your own.
When a project gets completed, you must
commission it with a grandiose ceremony. There should be photographers,
pressmen and most importantly, ribbon cutting. I remember a senator who built a
water closet system, one or two, named it an ultramodern facility, and put his
name in large letters on the wall engravings. Always put your name, your full
name in the engravings. Nobody will pay attention to those things so you won’t
need to explain why.
ON SUPPORTERS
Throughout your time in office, maintain a
strong base of supporters. This is hardly difficult, as you just need to employ
the same strategy you used during the election campaigns: firmly attach to your
ethnic group or religion. If you identify as a staunch Christian you will
always have fellow believers who will defend your every move. Identify with
your Fulani brothers, and they will always have your back.
As long as tribe or religion is concerned, the
masses can never unite on anything. You must use that in your favor.
ON THE GODFATHER
The Holy Book says you should give unto Caesar
what is due to Caesar. Give your godfather his regular share of the national
cake and as he demands. Remember what happened to that Governor who couldn’t
get a vote even in his hometown? His name is not important, but I have said my
own.
Even when you hear of his notorious deeds and dirty dealings, you should look away as it is none of your business. If word gets out in the news and it’s time to take a stand, what you must do is sit on the fence. That is not the time to be morally upright, but the time to suppress your conscience. You can pass a comment at a party meeting, let it be light, provoking some chuckle, but let it show clearly that you stand with him. He will hear about it and know that your head is still in the game.
ON CHALLENGES
There will be a few bumps on the road and some
people will try to cause trouble for you. You should try and settle them with
money, and quickly. But if that is not possible and the matter goes public,
find a ridiculous story and stick with it.
Have no fear as your supporters will believe
and rationalize the most ludicrous of explanations. For example, if they ask
for your secondary school certificate, which you lack, it is best to stick to a
story about animals eating it up, as these animals cannot speak to defend
themselves.
ON SELF CARE
Very importantly, don’t forget to eat your
share of the national cake. Open several offshore accounts and deposit as much
money as you can in them. Don’t even think about putting your children in
schools here, in the name of nationalism. Your earnings will be more than
enough to send them to schools in countries with white people. Make sure they
pick up an accent so the difference is clear.
ON REELECTION
In the end, it all comes down to those few
months before the elections, as you have the chance to be reborn, and your
slate wiped clean. The masses have the shortest memory. Prepare a fund for
those months as you will distribute free goods and services in exchange for
their votes.
When it’s time to share goods, make sure you
customize everything with your name, preferably your picture, as we don’t want
another team taking your credit. From loaves of bread to exercise books to bars
of soap, brand them all. It might seem strange to imprint your face on a bag of
rice, but that’s just how we do things here. Please don’t go around sharing
bags of beans as no one will take you seriously.
When the time comes I will hold another
masterclass in that regard but keep all that I have said in mind. Your job
requires the most minimal effort as you have done most of the work while
campaigning. Now is the time to eat the fruit of your labour.
Enjoy your stay in office, Your Excellency. Everyone should call you ‘Your Excellency’. Write that down.

DSS arrest geography teacher for teaching solar revolution,https://punocracy.com/dss-arrest-geography-teacher-for-teaching-solar-revolution/,2019-08-06T09:51:22+01:00,"EKITI (The T.A. Report)― Operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) have arrested a geography teacher at Ori-Eran Community Grammar School, Omoyemi Sofela, allegedly for teaching solar revolution to students of Senior Secondary School One (SS1).
Our correspondent gathered that this incident took place on Monday evening, shortly after the afternoon lessons.
“They came heavily armed, with four minibuses and two Armoured Personnel Carriers,” one witness told The T.A. Report.
“We thought they had come for cultists and kidnappers in the area, but it was only Mr Sofela they whisked away. They told the principal they overheard him teaching the topic of solar revolution to the children, and whisked him away to an unknown location.”
“We’ve not been able to reach him since then,” he added.
Peter Afunanya, the DSS spokesperson, explained during a phone interview on Monday that Sofela was teaching an outlawed subject.
“It is treasonable under the present regime to as much as think the word ‘revolution’ or mention it to a newborn child, let alone teach it to secondary school students,” he explained.
“Now that Nigeria is finally peaceful and Boko Haram has been, you know, defeated, we cannot afford to have anyone destabilise the country or heat up the polity using such language.”
He added that the curriculum revision recently done by the federal government has suggested alternatives for topics or theories that may be considered (t)reasonably unfair to the administration. “Solar revolution” is now to be known as “solar gyration” and all historical revolutions, such as the 1917 Russian revolution or the 1959 Cuban revolution, are now to be referred to simply as unrests—but must not be taught in classes.
All mentions of the Biafran war and any coup d’état at all, bloodless or not, are also banned from classrooms, Afunanya warned.
“We are likewise soon coming for all those unpatriotic Nigerians who refer to themselves as comrades and revolutionaries on social media. We know they are working for Iran, and we will not hesitate to charge them under the Terrorism Act.”
The DSSalso arrestedOmoyele Sowore, publisher of Sahara Reporters and former presidential candidate, on Saturday “for threatening public safety, peaceful co-existence and social harmony in the country” and has kept him in custody.
Analysts say Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria’s president and a former military dictator, is finally revealing his true body language.
“A leopard cannot change its spots and eight years is too long a time for a distinguished dictator to pretend he’s some ‘converted democrat’,” remarked a political commentator, who pleaded anonymity because “he’s claustrophobic and cannot possibly survive a day in jail”.

Twitter war: The best way Nigerians showcase their supremacy,https://punocracy.com/twitter-war-the-best-way-nigerians-showcase-their-supremacy/,2019-08-04T15:14:05+01:00,"By: Karshams
Breaking news: Nigeria is now home to the best-equipped Twitter Army
Attention! Attention! Where are those people who constantly badmouth and tongue-lash Nigeria and Nigerians? Where are they? Let them come out to show themselves. Where are those jealousy-filled nations that say Nigeria will never amount to anything useful? They all have gone hiding. Reality has dawned on them all. The nations that think we will always wallow in mediocrity are now shocked as our citizens begin to change the narrative by engaging in the greatest war of all time ⸺The Twitter War.
Now every nation is full of fear lest ever-gallant Nigerians gun them down with armoured tanks and nuclear bombs oftweets.
Nigeria ranks the best fighter on Twitter due to the doggedness and intellectualism of Nigerians who have debased, exterminated, and completely annihilated every nation that attempts to undermine her progress.
With the advancement and subsequent domination of Nigeria on Twitter, the nation will welcome tremendous uplift and huge productivity, and her 98 million poverty-stricken citizens will be alleviated. Who still says Nigerians are not intellectuals? Let such have a taste of their defeat on Twitter. Nonsense!
When the big-headed Kenyans dare challenge Nigerians on Twitter, they did not only suffer gross defeat but were also completely ripped off their senses by theintellectually superiorNigerians. No wonder, recently, no Nigerians have cried out over unemployment nor have they ventilated their displeasure on the governance of the country. Most of them, if not all, have become Field Marshalls of theNigerian Twitter Army⸺and, guess what, they are well-paid.
When Uganda, that struggling country in East Africa, also attempted to invade Nigeria on Twitter, expectedly, the patriotic citizens of Africa’s giant decimated them with a higher number oftweets⸺ the most-advanced modern ammunition.
Rather fortunately, this Twitter War is included in the Nigeria’s Educational Curriculum.
Towards the end of last year, something epic happened. Universities across Nigeria started attacking one another using tweets. First, it was#UnilagvsOAU,then#UIvsFUTAfollowed by others. This is no doubt an indication of the good educational system we have in Nigeria and the kinds of academics we nurture. It is nothing short of patriotism to leave pressing issues in academia to pursue Twitter Wars.
Dear President Buhari was impressed with this advancement that he allocated N494 billion or thereabout for the educational sector. But most students and academic stakeholders were complaining. Sai Baba, don’t mind them. They are no less confused than you are. Do your thing. Your things are always right.
As effective as Twitter Wars are though, it would be folly for anybody who feels Buhari is not doing enough to attempt displacing him first by taking over theNigerian Twitter Army (NTA). Atiku Abubakar, a major contender in the last general elections, did it. He controlled most soldiers of the NTA but he lost. Why? Well, because the election was never held on Twitter⸺as it should’ve.
Slowly but nicely, the world is respecting Nigeria because she is a threat with her5G Twitter Army. But then, it is said that scores of civilians have been rendered lifeless and homeless by the dreadful Bokoharam and ordinary cattle rearers, despite the nation’s intimidating army-Twitterati. But do not mind these reports as any battle outside Twitter is no battle at all.
Some bad people will say that Nigeria and Nigerians have been colonised again as theOyinbosdeceived Nigerians into dominating the Twitter war so that issues of corruption, nepotism, and government’s inadequacies will not be addressed. Once again, do not mind them. Didn’t the so-called great USA badmouth China’s 5G saying that it was cancerous and all that? When you hold the corridors of power, people will envy you. It is envy and sheer hypocrisy from these malicious people.
It is on Twitter you will see a Nigerian tweeting that“Buhari is the most confused leader in modern history, let the youth take over”.Seconds later, another Nigerian willaccuse the Ibo tribe of being the problem of the country because of the Biafran agitation. What causes this? I do not know, but it is not corruption.
Everyone is willing to die for Nigeria on Twitter. I heard Buhari is funding them. After this piece, I am rushing to the battlefield, not to fight but to receive my share. Wondering how that could happen? Don’t forget this is Nigeria and everything is impossibly possible.

Punocracy receives entries for maiden Prize for Satire,https://punocracy.com/just-in-punocracy-receives-entries-for-maiden-prize-for-satire/,2019-08-01T17:00:13+01:00,"Organisers of the 2019 Punocracy Prize for Satire have confirmed on Thursday that they received numerous entries for the first-of-its-kind writing competition.
In a press statement sent to this paper and signed by the team lead, the
Punocracy crew said their records show that 171 applications were made for the
prize. “But this includes entries that were sent multiple times,” the statement
added for clarity.
“We are thrilled so many young Nigerians made the decision to throw their
hats in,” the group said.
“It is not a coincidence that the word ‘satire’ sounds very much like
‘esoteric’. That is because not many people understand it, and not all who
understand it are in fact capable of writing it well.
“But here we have about one hundred and seventy one young persons chanting
‘yes we can!’. It is truly no mean feat. By the way, 126 of them are male, 44
are female, while one person preferred not to disclose his or her (or their)
gender.”
The crew said, with the enthusiasm shown by the entrants, they look forward
to discovering new talents, triggering new exploits, and shaking the
socio-political tables in Nigeria using fresh narrative techniques.
They further urged the entrants to follow the platform onFacebook,Twitter,Instagram, and also join the
‘mailing list’on WhatsAppso as not
to miss updates as soon as they are released.
The press statement mentioned that a shortlist of the best entries will be
announced sometime in September, after which the three top satirists will be
declared and awarded.
“May the best (wo)men win!” the release concluded."
How to be above the law in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-above-the-law-in-nigeria/,2019-07-31T10:09:45+01:00,"By: Karshams
In Nigeria, to be above the law takes simple procedures, and, surprisingly, they do not require money.
To be above the law, you should be a President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. By constitution, the legislature makes law in every country. But the case is not so in Nigeria as the president makes the law.
The president makes law himself — that is the president’s law, which is dynamic as it’s bound to change whenever another president comes in. I have predilection for President Muhammad Buhari’s Law. It is a straightforward kind of law. It is a ‘do-this and-do-that kind of law’. Don’t be confused; this is no decree, since he is not a military head of state. It is just a blend of his adamant wills and undemocratic policies.
The President removed the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen, before the general election because he was suspected to be working for the opposition party, PDP, without following the dictates of the constitution. He said Onnoghen was corrupt but he suddenly became mute when his cabinet ministers such as Rotimi Amaechi and the likes were alleged of corruption. That is another of his law which states: ‘you do not touch my beloved even if they are stained with the worst sin’. The President is a Creator and Abolisher of the law.
Also, to be above the law you should fight your way to be the Governor of any state in Nigeria. You will practically be untouchable. As a Governor, you will have the audacity to utter anything to the masses, abuse the public, and regard yourself as a constituted authority just like Governor Ajimobi of Oyo State (aka Mr. Koseleri 1) in a way that it disrespects the law. Did I say disrespect the law? Forgive me, I have forgotten the Governor supersedes the law because, as a Governor, you have the ‘power to-do and to-undo’.
You can delay civil servants’ salaries for numerous months; keep multiplying in your wealth and telling them there is no money. Nobody will accost you. And during the election time, you would pay them, say, for two months, as a plot to win the election for either yourself or your anointed one — just like former Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State.
Nobody will say anything since you are the law yourself. And you will still be compensated with a ministerial position for doing well to the citizens of your state by the President.
To be above the law, you should be a member of the APC. This is no hoax. Didn’t the party’s leader, Adams Oshiomole, say that whoever joins the party will have their sins forgiven? Including the sin of corruption that the Buhari-led administration is supposed to fight. So you can embezzle public funds as you like, huge enough to build another United Kingdom. Nobody will arrest you, not even Ibrahim Magu–led EFCC. APC is just like a large river that washes away sins — sins that cost the masses to suffer, and that which politico-criminals keep committing.
Are you still in doubt? Look no further. Remember how that bullion van carried huge cash to the mansion of Bola Tinubu, National leader of the APC, in Ikoyi, an eve to the general election? Didn’t the EFCC keep mute about it even when it violates the Money Acts? That’s how to be above the law!
If you wish to be above the law, you should also be a Fulani herdsman. Don’t be scared because as a Fulani herdsman, you are not a terrorist. You are Buhari’s people. You can trespass farmer’s farmland, and destroy their crops, or even maim them. No security operative will emasculate you.
According to reports, Fulani herdsmen, in April 2018, killed 19 people during a church service; in June 2018, they killed over 200 people in Plateau State; in February 2019, 11 people were killed in an attack on Adara community. The list goes on and on; yet the Fulani herdsmen have not been made to face the law. They even got social prestige as the federal government established a radio station for them, so as to reach them. So I hope you what I mean when I say the Fulani herdsmen, like the mere cattle rearers with long sticks and dirty regalia, are above the law?
If you reside in Nigeria you are the law yourself. You need not obey the law; rather, it is the law that obeys you. You make your own policies. You violate the customs and convention. If you are caught by the men in black, you would just grease their palms. That is not bribery; it is called charity. You are only extending your selflessness to the public.
You can do anything you want. You can abuse the president of your country and abuse his mother and grandmother on social media. Just do it. You are free. You are above the law. What lawsef? There is no law at all. And didn’t a proverb say that in a place where there is no law, there is no sin? So my brother you are sinless. You are a saint like St Peter and Paul.
In conclusion, if you want to be above the law, you just have to be born in the country that is infamous for her giantness: the giant ant with a big head and little or no sense. The country is right here: Nigeria."
What is the fuss about Buhari’s “angelic” ministers?,https://punocracy.com/what-is-the-fuss-about-buharis-angelic-ministers/,2019-07-28T19:35:00+01:00,"To be honest, it is probably one of the hardest things to do when you have to pick 43 people from a teeming 180 million people (some say it is 200 million). It is not their fault; 2006 was the last time we had a census. Too many attempts to have another one has been botched by one challenge or the other. That’s Nigeria for you. Pardon my digression. Back to the“angelic fantastic forty-three”.
Why has everyone been so concerned about these angels? Have you for once thought that, of the 180 million (or whatever estimate you believe in) people who call Nigeria home, about 91.6 million have been employed by poverty? Or the incredulous 13.2 million out-of-school? And so on. Shouldn’t these be of much concern than a paltry 43 that would end up consuming what would have changed the narratives of the 91.6 million for life?
Mind you, those figures are estimates because we don’t have a national database; when it comes to managing situations, Nigeria is first to all. But we all know this is no fault of the incumbent president.
He inherited the skeletal version of the Nigeria we hope for — no thanks, in large part, to the previous administrations. All the evils he met in office are from his predecessors; and the good he met therein are his. You know how we say it?
In spite of all his efforts to clear the cobwebs around the head of Nigeria, all he gets is ungratefulness.Deriz God. Rather than appreciate his handwork (sorry, hard work; I keep mixing them up) many busybodies have been running their mouths, saying there is no substance in a list a man toiled day and night to formulate for 55 days! Isn’t that callous?
They compare Boris Johnson, UK new Prime Minister’s pace to appoint his cabinet with Buhari’s 55 days. They forget that Boris is 55, and Buhari is 76. Who could have been more agile? Boris appointed a relative of his; had Buhari done same would you have made similar comparison? C’mon don’t be a hypocrite.
Some say it’s a list of party loyalist. Abah! Hasn’t the president said it before hand that he would only be appointing those he knows? You don’t feed your enemy before a fight; do you? This life is about give and take. You give, you get. You shouldn’t expect to reap where you didn’t sow.
Those asking for more women in the ministerial list. You may also wish to answer this yourself: how many women are in politics? And how many of those in it have influence. Or do you think by sitting at home behind your android phone and tweeting this and that will throw ministerial appointment at you? We must understand that merit system trumps quota system, any day, any time.
We can forgive the presidency, however, that he did 16% as against the30% inclusion-in-government target he promised. Naming figures at times can be very confusing and tempting. His typist might have been overwhelmed by campaign demands to have inflated that figure without the president’s knowledge. There are still more appointments to be made. We will get there even if it is after this adminstration.
It is the number — 43 — that some have issues with. They say it’s another wasteful spree of national cake. Tell me, if we don’t spend the moneywetin we gain? These same people were the ones who complained about Fashola’s delivery in his 3-in-1 ministry. Now, the president is trying to lessen the burden yet you complain? What can he ever do to please you?
Some even say the Senate were shameless to have asked some appointees to “take a bow”. Really? Do you want to teach them their job? When you know you could do better, why didn’t you pick a legislative ticket during the last election?Abeg, pack well.
Let’s even think about it, don’t people get employed just by the employer’s examination of the employee’s CV? No formal interview. No test. Nothing. Employment straight. Same can of be said of this, too.
Come to think of it. How can a whole veteran political juggernaut like George Akume stand before upcoming senators like Elisha Abbo for screening? It’s unheard of please. Let’s not even go further on this. Who does that?
The integrity of some names was the cause of concern for a number of Facebook sons and Twitter daughters. Many of these children of exuberance particularly have an ax to grind withangelicGodswill Akpabio who since he became a political born again by the virtue of joining the All Progressives Congress has been forgiven all his sins, and admitted into the earthly paradise in Abuja. They say same of Timipre Silva.
It is jealousy. No better word to describe it. What is bad in being discharged of EFCC trial? It simply means, in the words of Atiku (sources say he could have been a minister too if…haq, haq, haq), the referee (in this case, EFCC) has admitted he was wrong in his initial decision. Besides, what is the better way to fight corruption than this? Mind you, you don’t talk down on angels like that!
Now to Mr Innovation, “Air Marshal” Hadi Sirika, whom some said didn’t meet the cutoff for promotion to the “next level”. If you allow the president’s Katsina countryman to go like that, who will take over the ruins that is left of Nigeria Air? Who? You? He conceived the stillbirth. Give him more time to think if he can develop an ideal catholicon to probably bring the dead back to live. We never can tell — only time can. So give him time.
Talk of the attorney general, Abubakar Malami, who believes, like General (I mean Poresident) Buhari, his principal, thatcourt orderscan be disobeyed so long national interest is at stake. You won’t blame the Kebbi-man; he that pays the attorney directs his reasoning? So, welcome back Mr AGF.
Also, Saraki’s nemesis are licking their fingers now. Chief of propaganda, Lai (autocorrect believes it should be Lie) Mohammed and Gbemisola Saraki, two ardent heralds of theO’togecatchphrase, have been given the ultimate reward. Let nobody envy them. When they were working hard where were you? Were you not here abusing them?
They say the reward for hard work is more work. This is the tale behind the indefatigable Babatunde Raji Fashola’s grey hair and seeming weight loss,presidency’s requirement for promotion. Give it to the SAN and his principal.
Perhaps you have issue with double–portion Rotimi Amaechi and Osun’s Jagaban, Rauf Aregbesola. You don’t have to. We all know what they both did in the last presidential and their respective state’s elections. They have paid their price let them enjoy their prize, too.
Little was known in Oyo State political cycle of Sunday Dare whose CV is replete with a balanced diet of experience vitamins and qualification minerals. But we now no better. His proposed agenda for the communication sector seems plausible but let’s see if he can put his money where his mouth is. Ditto for Festus Keyamo’s radical judiciary reforms.
Lest I forget, the casualties of a nonexistent supplementary list whose noses where bruised need to be touched on too. Step forward Solomon Dalung and Audu Ogbe. They both did more in popularizing fake news than they did sectoral reforms. Thank you for your service to fatherland. Enjoy your ministerial retirement entitlements in peace.
Up next is embittered (sorry embattled) Adebayo Shittu who did more wrestling in state politics than he did in the telecommunication ministry. While I understand it is hard to leave national obligations for national assignment(I don’t know the difference either), I hope this political interstice will give you the time to observe the one-year compulsory national service. We the Nigerian youths can’t wait to see you on khaki.
With a standing ovation, welcome the worst hit, Senator Abiola Constituted Authority Ajimobi, the grandiloquent, no–nonsense, soapy-mouth former Oyo state governor who lost his senatorial bid to unpopular Kola Balogun. It is understood that himself, his aides and wife havemade a fortune out  of this. Sources living next door to my sources said the president doesn’t want the baggage of this allegations to be placed on his cabinet; hence, Ajimobi’s exclusion. So shall we say bye to thekòselèrì(never being before) nowkòselèmó(never to be again) of the pace setter state?
Nigeria shall be greater again. Forever.
Happy resumption, Honourable Ministers."
Nigeria Air’s death anniversary and why Gbajabiamila needs 361 aides│Oladeinde Olawoyin,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-airs-death-anniversary-and-why-gbajabiamila-needs-361-aides-by-oladeinde-olawoyin/,2019-07-28T09:04:32+01:00,"This piece wasoriginally publishedby Premium Times on July 20, as part of the writer’s Satire Saturday weekly column.
On Wednesday, July 17,Distinguished Speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, announced the appointment of 27 new aides. According to a statement by Lanre Lasisi, Mr Gbajabiamila’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, the new appointees were largely selected from former members of the House of Representatives.
Expectedly, they included members who lost their re-election bids and a few loyal protegees of Mr Gbajabiamila. That very significant decision came barely a week after the speaker appointed one, two, three, four, five, and… six—–six media aides.
The day after Mr Gbajabiamila’s historic announcement, July 18, marked the first year (death) anniversary of Nigeria’s space-disrupting airline, Nigeria Air——-that huge conduit that, originally, was never meant to be a dream, launched with pomp and pageantry last year, precisely on July 18, 2018. As expected on such day of indescribable significance, Nigerians from across the world felicitated with the Nigerian government for its visionary moves and record-shattering initiative. The uncommon dreamer that is former minister Hadi Sirika too got not a few accolades, especially among frequent air travellers on Twitter. Many of them have enjoyed the service of the airline in the last one year, at least, if we consider the “technicalities” of technically imaginative usage—-as my Lord the CJN would have said.
Now all of this happened, quite alright, but only as farcical chain of events in that huge house of commotion that is Nigeria.
To be sure, Speaker Gbajabiamila’s new appointment and Nigeria Air’s first-year Memorial Day—-a replica of what is known as Shraadh in Nepal and India—-are two separate things, at least on the surface. But it is not for nothing that these two developments are separated by just 24 hours. This arty treatment of chronology of events perhaps accentuates the genius of that unseen hand that writes the script of Nigeria’s comedy of the absurd. (Or could it be what Dr. Reuben Abati described as Aso Rock “Demonic forces”?)
First off, that the Nigeria Air idea never materialised was no surprise to anyone with even the faintest of ideas on how aviation concerns work. For one, at the time promoters of the airline were junketing around the world, hawking nothing, there were no concrete plans on ground to show that an airline was to be birthed. For instance, there was this conflict of ideas between the Ministry of Transport and the ICRC, the regulatory body, on conditions to be met before a national carrier could be established. The transport ministry, even at the time we were hawking empty hope around the globe, acted in breach of most of those conditions, especially the provisions in the Certificate of No Objection.
Then there were issues of decaying and non-existent infrastructure; of then Nigerian Airways unpaid pensioners (which the government, thankfully, later addressed); of ICRC’s clear proposal that the Nigerian government must not wholly operate the airline; and numerous other issues steeped in our dysfunctional state of Any-how-ness. Clearly, Nigeria air was a still-birth ab initio and those who orchestrated the “arrangement” knew this all along. But, most importantly, they were confident they would never account for that misadventure.
SATIRE SATURDAY would still probably come back to this next year when we would be celebrating the second year (death) anniversary of the airline. By then, hopefully, we would declare a public holiday for the day’s celebration, arrange a significant budgetary allocation for a star-studded concert in Lagos and London and, who knows, bestow national honours on those who “engineered” the project.
Back to Mr Gbajabiamila’s historic announcement of new aides, this column understands that the Honourable Speaker now has at least 33 aides to work with him and elevate his vision to develop Nigeria via people-oriented lawmaking. In his inauguration address, the Speaker eloquently spoke of these dreams and this column understands that only people, and not structures and institutions, make dreams a reality.
In almost every criticism of Nigeria’s system of governance in the past, our lawmaking bodies took the front seat. It was criticised as wasteful and unsustainable, with others suggesting that we could make do with part-time legislature. In today’s Nigeria, political correctness is the norm: things that were considered “worst” in those days of, say, Obasanjo or Jonathan are now considered “slightly bad”—-or, even, “not too good”. Thanks to everyone who made this happen to Motherland.
So in line with this new tradition of interrogating issues Nigeriana, as the great Pius Adesanmi (of blessed memory) would say, SATIRE SATURDAY opines that anyone that criticises the National Assembly of today is short-sighted. Clearly, anyone who understands Senate President Ahmed Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila’s dreams for the National Assembly would not peddle anything negative about them, even if they choose to appoint ALL members of their constituencies as aides. They’ve got huge dreams and, frankly, to drive these dreams, they need no structure, no institutions, no rules, no guidelines; all they need is a crowd. More, more and more people, my people. Of course, Nigeria’s never-diminishing commonwealth would cater to that.
So, as things stand, Mr Gbajabiamila’s decision to appoint just 33 aides is a disaster waiting to happen. He needs more and more aides—-at least 360, a number that matches the gigantic structure of his dreams and of course the number of members he has to deal with in the House, especially those recalcitrant opposition figures. And as he has shown commendableespirit de corpsby appointing former members of the House as aides, there are still more people from where those ones came. He could go back to the archive and check through names of House members who lost re-election bids since 1999 and he would have more than enough. Of course, no number would be enough for this kind of dream, anyway.
Lastly, I was going through the list on Thursday and was fascinated by the portfolio of the new aides. There is a special adviser on political matters and another special assistant on political matters; there is a special assistant on former members’ affairs and another special assistant on members’ affairs; there are special assistants on political matters in each of the geo-political zones too. Ingenius!
SATIRE SATURDAY, however, noticed an unpardonable error: the list does not cater for perhaps the most important concern that contributed to Mr Gbajabiamila’s nationwide acceptance and speakership mandate: Bourdillon Affairs. The speaker ran perhaps the most colourful and, well, cash-backed speakership campaign Nigerians have ever seen in the last decade. Such a well-oiled campaign could not have been possible without Ikoyi’s interest. That interest must also be considered in appointments. So this column proposes another slot for a Senior Special Assistant on Bourdillon “2023” Affairs. The lucky appointee would be the Speaker’s 361st aide, and, considering the significance of his job description, he must be “empowered” to have his own aides too.
For god and Country.

Dear Baba… an open letter to President Buhari,https://punocracy.com/dear-baba/,2019-07-28T07:13:06+01:00,"By:Raheem Hammed Gbolahan
Dear Baba,
Perhaps, it’s late to congratulate you on your victory at the poll, or I’m just waiting for the tribunal to conclude their findings and make their judgment (already known to us all).
Although some people believe you control the judiciary, I stood firmly by you that you have no hand in the removal of the erstwhile CJN, and you also have no hand in the current implant of our new CJN. (The judiciary is independent after all.) Someone even said you both have something in common, and I immediately cautioned him that: termites ate his certificate; nothing ate yours. That said, congratulations on your victory, and I hope this next level is going to be sweeter than the previous level.
Baba, I heard some people are being kidnapped here and there in the north, that they even came to Katsina state, and that bandits are killing people in Zamfara among other neighbouring states. Don’t mind these news people; they are only spreading fake news to distract you from achieving the best for the country in this Next Level.
Some even went as far as claiming it’s your kinsmen who are perpetrating these heinous atrocities. They labelled the Fulani herdsmen as evil; they said they carry guns around while rearing their cattle and they shoot at farmers or villagers that refused to allow their cattle graze. All these allegations are totally false.
And even if they are true, don’t these farmers have animal feelings? Do they want these cattle to die of hunger? Aren’t the guns they carry for self defense? I don’t even understand our people anymore. They just want to hate on innocent tribes, going about their daily routine in the country. Please sir, whenever any southerner kills any cow, declare a two-day holiday for us to mourn. (Injustice to one is injustice to all.)
In addition, don’t mind that Yoruba socio-cultural group telling Fulani herdsmen to vacate the southwest because, allegedly, some armed men perceived to be herdsmen killed the daughter of one of their leaders. The country is safe. Our level of insecurity is zero⸺after all, they haven’t killed any minister’s son or daughter yet. Why then should you act?
Baba, these news people are out to undermine your competence in this Next Level government as usual. Imagine, they said you should release the leader of Shiite group. (They certainly dunno what is going on), you that you didn’t release Dasuki after how many court orders?
Oh! I also read that one Deputy Commissioner of Police and a youth corps member died in the clash between Shiites and the Police. Since you’ve tendered your condolence message on Twitter, and sent a letter to the families of the deceased, that’s fair enough. It’s a welcome development too that the court has named the Shiites a terrorist group. Service chiefs will need more billions of naira to buy arms to deal with them, and more jobless youths will be recruited to fight this newly recruited terrorist group.
The more the terrorist groups, the more the job opportunities for the youth and the more the money for service chiefs. You know what I mean?
Permit me to also advise you to disregard requests from the Iranian government telling you to send El-Zakzaky to their country for medical attention. Like who does that? With the best of medical facilities we have in the country? Who goes abroad for medical attention⸺well, if not you? We that have more than enough medical doctors, and we don’t even mind lending them to the UK or Canada to practice? Don’t mind Iran; their leaders must be jokers. Our medical facilities are superior to those of any nation in the world, and the Shiite leader is receiving the best treatment anyone can get.
Let me join other well-meaning Nigerians to give you thumbs-up for the best set of men you nominated as ministers. I call them MEN OF INTEGRITY. Haters definitely ‘gonna’ hate, but it’s none of your business… as usual. The likes of Godswill Akpabio, Lai Mohammed, Rotimi Amaechi, just name it. Baba! You are the best!
I must also confess that the Senate under the leadership of Ahmed Lawan is doing great too in drilling them with the toughest questions ever. Lawan can never be a stooge. It’s impossible. He just would like to extend the culture of ‘bow and go’ to Amaechi on compassionate grounds. After all, he got there all by himself; you have no hand in it.
On a final note for now, Baba, these South African people killing and harassing Nigerians like we mean nothing to them, what exactly is wrong now? It’s not today they’ve been killing us over there, and it definitely won’t be long before the bloodshed gets to an important son or daughter of the soil. More importantly, I hope they won’t try to harass our cattle in case we have a ranches over there.

Why obey a court order when…,https://punocracy.com/why-obey-a-court-order-when/,2019-07-26T05:58:22+01:00,"Let’s be honest:unemploymenthas a lot of advantages, especially for the ruling class. The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has long realised this, and that’s why it is working so hard to keep it high and perpetually news-worthy.
But that’s not why we’re here.
We’re here because unemployment also has tremendous disadvantages—one of which is that many Nigerians somehow have enough time on their hands to be bothered about such petty things as court orders.
Court orders. Haha. Ain’t that fantastically hilarious? I suppose it is what happens when people overdose on Hollywood movies and read more news from CNN than local newspapers. They start comparing their beloved fatherland to countries like the United States of America.
First of all, it’salready establishedthat, contrary to popular opinion, the judiciary is in fact not even up to one arm of government in Nigeria. As we have already seen, the president is capable of firing the Chief Justice of Nigeria with as much ease as making the EFCC drop a case against ministerial nominees or aspiring senate presidents.
The judiciary only exists as an elaborate, well-funded advisory body to the executives. Their job is to tell the president what they think the lawmakers are trying to say in the statutes, and also to give people the ridiculous impression that there’s a rule of law that supercedes executive powers.
Haven’t you noticed that all the time the military seized power in the past, they managed to suspend everything from the cabinet and the national assembly to the almighty, supposedly supreme constitution, but they always left the courts alone. Well, it’s not because the courts were too strong. It’s rather because they were (and still are) inconsequential, apologies to one-term—sorry, one-time—minister, Adebayo Shittu.
But, mind you, this is only true for Nigeria, unarguably a democratic role model to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, many other countries have yet to realise that the true role of the judiciary is as a loud-speaker and rubber-stamper, just as the true place of women is inyou-know-where. Don’t go to Canada and start disobeying established authorities. You’re on your own.
So, tell me: Why obey a court order?
Why? When we have transitioned from the Let-Justice-Be-Done-Even-If-Heaven-Falls era to the era of Let-Justice-Be-Done-Unless-There’s-A-Technical-Reason-Not-To. Since we can’t distinguish easily between just and technical court orders, why not just subsume all of them under executive orders? Problem solved, right?
Hey, why obey a court order when there’s loads of money just sitting in the treasury and waiting to be spent? Don’t Nigerians know that one high-profile person in police custody is worth over 10,000talakawas? A whopping N3.5 million is Nigeria’smonthly expenseon feeding El-Zakzaky alone, according to Alhaji Lai. The amount will be nearing N10 million by the time we add Sambo Dasuki. If we release these fellows according to some court orders, what do Nigerians expect the government to do with all that money, eh? Improve the schools? Fix the roads? Haha. Certainly not.
Why obey a court order when you have hundreds of thousands of policemen and lots and lots of soldiers who are ever-ready to crush any form of protest against the Next Level agenda? If you obey the orders, there won’t be protests, and if there are no protests how do we justify having so many policemen on our payroll, eh? All the big men and politicians already have more than enough and we still have thousands left doing nothing of national importance.
Why obey a court order when you have millions of super-reasonable Nigerians, fondly and better known asBuharists? They have come to understand that it is enormously difficult to think for oneself, and so pledge full, aggressive, and witless loyalty to the leader, who of course has been adjudged capable of no wrongdoing whatsoever.
Why obey a court order when there’s Twitter? Even if lots of innocent,preciouslives are lost during a protest over the continued detention of someone despite court orders, all you need is a thread thatstartswith you “most deeply commiserating with the families” of the victims,continueswith a threat to the protesters, andendswith a prayer to God—you know, because Nigerians don’t justloveprayers, they alsolove(authoritarian) leaders who pray.
Why obey a court order when you have the Code of Conduct Bureau: That sleeping bulldog that is ready to rip any bloke to pieces and ensure that not only does he hang his name, he also hangs his work attire and retires without protest.
Why obey a court order when you are a former military dictator? An entire war hero and General! You want people to start thinking you’re soft, eh?
Why obey a court order when you have more important things on your schedule? You know, like coming up with a list of 43 ministerial nominees, the highest in the country’s long history. People think it is easy, but they dunno what is going on. They don’t know that choosing a minister is like choosing a wife, with whom you’ll be in bed for four years. It is like choosing people to manage your well-earned riches. Those who do it in hours or days probably made use of Artificial Intelligence (which, by the way… just like that video of Ganduje receiving kickbacks in dollars, cannot be trusted).
… Important things to do like releasing press statements to wish important living people happy birthday, to wish important dead people a peaceful rest, and to congratulate important president-elects all over the world. Important things like taking care of the president’s health. We all know that health is wealth, don’t we?
Think about it: Why obey a court order when we can go to war? With Boko Haram technically defeated, Nnamdi Kanu hiding in the abroad, and kidnappers surrendering their weapons left and right, is it not high time Nigeria created a new war to distract us from the racketing going on in the government?
Besides, if we don’t have a major violent conflict to contend with, there’ll be no justification to keep giving the lion’s share in our annual budget to Defence. And you know what that means: Education, or even Health, might take centre stage in our fiscal policies, which is totally unacceptable. What are they going to do with all that money, uh? Never in our history has that happened and it definitely won’t start under the watch of this proactive administration.
Nah.
PS.Even if the president were to disregard all these sensible reasons and decides to obey court orders, Nigerians should understand that obeying court orders aren’t as easy as activists make it seem. First, you have to think of when you are going to obey it. Second, you might need to set up a committee to decide to what extent you are going to obey it. Then, we may need to wait for another budgeting cycle so as to include the huge costs of, er, releasing people on bail and all that. C’mon. Life is hard. Governance in Nigeria, especially, is rocket science. Don’t make it look so simple."

There’s awarcoming, and I find the unfolding events entertaining. The last days of peace are often tension-filled, like where a knife is introduced to the rope that binds us all. While it cuts its way through, we must find a reason to laugh the pain and bloodshed away too.
Nigerians. We possess a superpower: the ability to make jokes and banter about anything. Even if our homes were on fire, we’d still find a way to inspire happiness and laughter; but where we can’t laugh, we pray⸺we cannot come and go and die for nothing. The same things that make other people occupy the streets make us tweet memes, occupy Church auditoriums on Friday nights, and nobody and nothing has seemed powerful enough to take our laughter and spirituality away. I don’t see why the last days of Peace should.
Nigeria is drifting very fast to a point of no return, a place where the centre will no longer hold, where falcons will grow deaf to the falconer, this place where anomaly has settled into the thrown of normalcy. Anarchy will be loosened upon the land.
But look unto the bright side, we will have a very interesting story to tell our children, of these happenings, one where things fell apart, in a country, in her last days of peace, where cows were wielding AK 47s in her streets, socio-cultural groups making terrorist demands and threats while leaders of bandit criminal cartels got state visits and VIP treatments.
“There is a war coming.”
It seems like thewaris already here⸺a war of words. One that the former President has not given up on, even as his ink seems to be running dry. It’s quite unusual of Baba Iyabo to give us something as short as a four-page letter. Everything certainly doesn’t seem okay at Ota; we are used to getting albums from him, not EPs. This four-page letter has got to be his shortest, most lax, and possibly his most irrelevant letter ever, according to public opinion.
Personally, I think Baba Iyabo’s letter was so on-point, just on one point, where he asked us to pray. Nigeria really needs prayers, prayers, and another CONFAB. This new National Conference will help pray collectively for the wellbeing of our motherland. The next CONFAB, which OBJ has suggested we hold, should solely focus on gaining spiritual aid for Nigeria. No time should be wasted in discussing national issues and ways forward; nobody has that time to waste.
Since the leaders have refused to look into the petitions and conclusions from the 2014 CONFAB, I sincerely think a new CONFAB should be convened, and this time all petitions and requests should be directed to God. If we persist well enough, he’s a loving Father, he’ll answer. A national day of fasting and rigorous head-swinging prayers should be declared also. Terrific idea, I think.
Nigeria, our strength is in our diversity, until our diversity becomes our bane. Men like me are super-excited about OBJ’s letter, all the pointers therein, and how it’s about to change our country for “God”, but men like Miyetti Allah are not having it; I can’t deal with that guy.
There is awarcoming, and it’s filled with lots of jokes; comedian number one⸺Miyetti Allah. Let’s start with what’s not funny, Miyetti Allah getting pissed. You don’t want a pissed Miyetti on your hands,nahhh. When Miyetti gets pissed, monkeys get socked in blood and we don’t want that either, especially seeing as our monkey’s hate the sight of blood. We must do everything to keep Miyetti Allah happy, even if it means giving out our ancestral lands. After all, Fulanis own all the land in Nigeria; they just leased some out to our forefathers. You didn’t know? Then your ancestors are the ones at fault for not giving you the memo.
What’s funny is how easy it takes Uncle Miyetti to get pissed. His temper is a basketball court of thin ice. I love Miyetti Allah for one thing though,once him vex like this, you go know;egbonwill release a press statement ASAP like the one he did calling for the arrest a Former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and General of the Nigerian Army. Audacity is his second name. Of course, I would also adopt audacity as my middle if I had the most powerful man in the country as my patron.
It’s even funnier how Miyetti Allah is now a household name, drags anyone at will, how they make indiscriminately ludicrous demands and nobody gets to tell them a thing. I understand them though, they just want what’s best for their people, and whoever gets hurt in the process…ehyafor them. Isn’t that just one beautiful advantage of our diversity and a good show of respect for decorum and collectiveness? I love.
The Nigerian polity has now become that face-me-I-face-you compound of one new day, one newwahala.
Since several social-cultural groups posing to protect Northern interests with their mastery in the art of releasing indiscriminate evidence of terrible mental health situations, disguised in press releases, the Igbimo Odo Yoruba has decided not to carry last. The Yoruba youth have to show that they have craze too. Rising to the occasion of representing the Yoruba people in this mouth-making competition, this time in defense of one of their most prominent leaders, a letter-writing maniac, Igbimo Odo Yoruba have fired back at Miyetti Allah and everyone in their WhatsApp group, threatening fire and brimstone on anybody who tries their Ebora Owu with arrest threats and whatnot.
The Yoruba boy in me understands that allnah frapapa,make we talk so that e no go be like we no get mouth. The Igbimo Odo Yoruba clap back did not faze me. I was more concerned about the Aare Anakankanfo, Gani Adams’ statement, where he said, “If we react don’t blame us.” But really though, as far as no monkey gets soaked in blood in view of this reaction, I’m good.
I’m good, but not satisfied. My brethren from the South-East and South-South are missing out of thewar. Is it not time they joined this war of endlessfrapapasand tongue-tingling? This period in Nigeria is like that time in a wedding ceremony where you get to say your mind or forever remain silent. Ndi-Igbo and her sister from down South, don’t y’all have something to say? No opening remarks before the kickoff? Please don’t disappoint me; I fear that, at times like this, your silence can be used against you in the court of law. Say somethingbiko.
There is awarcoming, a war likely borne out of this uncultured war of words, a war where we will have more fronts to worry about than we are united to face: Boko Haram, ISWAP, bandits of various kinds, Pirates in our waters, Niger Delta militants, disgruntled rouge soldiers, kidnappings, poverty, poor education and terrible health care, amongst others.
Awaris coming, but not to worry: God will protect his babies so long as we pray.

Why government should ban Big Brother Naija,https://punocracy.com/why-government-should-ban-big-brother-naija/,2019-07-13T11:03:09+01:00,"Originally aTwitter threadby Kelvin Odanz.
I think MURIC (Muslim Rights Concern) has a point in saying Big Brother Naija should be banned. This is an issue of national emergency if you ask me. BBNaija is not only distracting us from tackling Fulani herdsmen and corruption in Nigeria; it also infringes on the religious right of some peace-loving Muslims.
While growing up, it was a norm that Deeper Life members saw seeing television as a sin. I think it is a historical injustice that televisions were not banned for their sake. That was a mistake. But in this internet age, we can’t repeat such a mistake.
Religious tolerance means accommodating everyone’s religious believes. For instance, Deeper Lifers still frown at women wearing trousers and jewellery. We need to do something about this. It is a hindrance to we forging unity to tackle national issues.
Let the government set an example by banning BBNaija. We need to begin somewhere. After BBNaija, we can then pay proper attention to urgent matters like Television, Jewellery, Trousers etc. Other countries are progressing. Nigeria can’t afford to lag behind.Tainks.
By the way, only unprogressive bigots will disagree with what MURIC has been saying. Bigots don’t belong in our modern society, they lack the RANGE to function in a modern world. Religious tolerance is key. Bigotry has no place among us. Do better, please.
Please if you don’t have anything relevant to say, just keep quiet. You people are displaying your ignorance on Twitter. Do you know how dangerous BBNaija is? Do you know the harm jewellery or trousers can do to the spiritual health of some Christians? Are you guys okay?
Nigerians are hypocrites. And it can honestly get disgusting. What is wrong with some of you?  Fulani Herdmen are killing people, Shiites are protesting, and you think the government shouldn’t ban#BBNaija? This country is not ready for change. I am literally shaking. I am shuddering.

Who needs traditional protests when we have social media!,https://punocracy.com/who-needs-traditional-protests-when-we-have-social-media/,2019-07-13T10:05:48+01:00,"By: Chuks Chinyere (jj)
It’s 2019 fam. We are bringing tech into every aspect of our lives — or is it taking every aspect of our lives and putting it into tech? I’m not sure though, but whatever it is, trust Nigerians to overdo it.
If there is one thing we know how to do as Nigerians, it’s knowing and doing better than our teachers. In most cases, we’re actually doing before knowing, or doing without knowing whilst we act like we know it all. I might sound like I don’t really know what I’m talking about o, but I can assure you that I do. I have been Nigerian for a long time.
In all honesty, I’m proud to be Nigerian — we whooped South Africa at the quarterfinals and we are one step closer to winning another AFCON. But that’s not the main. The main reason my national pride has soared is the rate at which we have managed to affect issues that affect us; as a collective unit we seem to have got the hang of this “protest for change thing”.
I am proud of how we’ve managed to master the art of protesting, social media style! Remember 2017? Early that year, TuBaba called for a protest march, Davido seconded, we were ready to march the whole of Lagos down to prove a point… well, until TuBaba discovered that a Street Protest March was actually overrated, unsafe, and he pulled out — no one would have guessed, by the way, that TuBaba knew how to “pull out”.
Recall that Comrade Deji Adeyanju got a penthouse suite in Keffi prison for python dancing in front of the Police headquarters in Abuja. So with this little evidence at hand, the Nigerian people reached a consensus that no cause is worth occupying the streets for, except its the streets of Twitter.
We discovered Social Media Protesting, tried it out on a few causes, hit progress, now its time to go international. Besides, what is better than protesting “The Primary School Feeding Programme” with one hand and tearing on a lip-smacking chicken lap with another?
In the last month, we have recorded enormous success, starting with Pastor Biodun stepping down from his position as Head of COZA. Nigerians took it from the streets of Social Media to the streets of Abuja, right in front of his church building, dragged not only the image of this “Man Of God” but also took it a step further by shaming his churchgoers as well since they must have had a hand in his promiscuity and alleged sexual predation. Shaming Sunday churchgoers was just the right thing to do. Anyway, Pastor Biodun stepped down. Nigerians won.
Next up, RUGA. They proposed to give our lands to cows and other farm animals like it was a story written by George Orwell. We shouted, refused, raised our voices, disagreed with one loud accord… tweet after tweet, this time it all happened on social media. Without stepping a foot out of our home, we raised enough dust. The government, for the first time in a long time, budged to the people’s demand and suspended the damn RUGA installations. We won again.
Ruguyzwere not very happy about the development o; they issued threats — threats that could make a Crocodile smile or a Python dance, but Bubu said we should ignore. Of course, we ignored because we had a more pressing matter to deal with: the rise of a kickboxing Senator.
If I were the leader of the Nigerian Senate, I too would have been unable to find a person better than Senator Remi Tinubu, to actively partake in the disciplinary committee on Senator Abbo’s assault case. I mean, who has better experience in such cases, than one who is a serial assaulter. Senator Obanikoro can tell you stories of how fingers were dancing in his eyes on the Senate floor. Did I hear you say cases of physical assault in the premises of the National Assembly are not uncommon? Yes, you are very correct, as far back as the First Republic, the floor of our legislative has been a ground for kicking, fighting and all kinds ofgbasandgbos.
However, our record-breaking Senator Elisha Abbo, unsatisfied with breaking the record of the youngest Nigerian Senator, took his record-breaking skills a notch further, this time kicking and fighting a nursing mother in a sex shop. Unbeatable!
Armed with the new shiny skills of Social Media Protesting, Nigerians scored another progress, by forcing a half-baked apology out of Senator Abbo, rejecting the nonsensical apology, and clamouring loud enough till we got a court hearing the matter. I’m so proud of us.
However, it turns out that I’m not as proud as the esteemed members of the Arewa Twitter Community.
These guys, having holistically looked through developing stories and all other unfolding events inside of the Nigerian space, decided that there were no more causes to fight for and protest over at home; it was time to take our Social Media Protesting trade to the shores of the abroad.
When you’re as rich as MBS, there will always be something to celebrate, there will always be a reason to have Nicki Minaj over for some entertaining performance. When news broke about one of such performances, Arewa Twitter was not having it. Tweets started flying all over about how wrong it was to have Nicki Minaj perform in Saudi Arabia. It was unholy, amongst other things.
I was beyond elated when I learnt that NICKI MINAJ and Mohammed Bin Salam — the Crown Prince Of Saudi Arabia — held an emergency meeting, to deliberate on the concerns of Arewa Twitter, and a way forward. The result of their meeting as communicated to the entire Twitter population by Bashir Ahmed, Media Aide to President Buhari, was to cancel Nicki Minaj’s performance in the kingdom, solely due to the concerns raised by members of Awera Twitter living in Nigeria.
Celebration by Arewa Twitter over this news was more than what it would be if the Super Eagles won AFCON 2019. Arewa Twitter forced the hand of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, one of 21st Centuries’ most brutal, by the power of Social Media Protesting.Issa lie, adonbilivit.
Don’t you just love how much influence we have today, thanks to Social Media Protesting, and Arewa Twitter for scored one big one for the whole team.
Let’s keep it up and hope, soon, we might be able to find genuine and progressive causes to fight for, collectively beneficial issues to protest about, apply reason before concluding, and most importantly eschew bandwagonism.

"A Modest Proposal—on Ruga, Buhari’s overdue foreign travel, and other matters",https://punocracy.com/a-modest-proposal-on-ruga-buharis-overdue-foreign-travel-and-other-matters/,2019-07-13T09:07:34+01:00,"By: Akin Oseni
We are in the season of endless arguments, harsh criticisms, and bitter controversies occasioned by some salient national issues.
While everybody is talking, grunting, and blaming, no one is really willing to put forth any pragmatic idea towards resolving the many rancours. Pathetic.
Sadly still,  it is a rare practice here,  to see the well-read professors wade into socio-political debates, as they are given to more serious intellectual engagements of Protracted Striking Mechanism (PSM),  Standard Concepts of SDCization, Sex-for-Mark Theory and related scholarly ideologies. And of course, the learned fellows are technically busy at the moment researching on new legal terminologies like ‘case technicality’, ‘consented rape’, and other maxims and lexemes in the legal profession.  So shall we stand akimbo and watch the controversies in the country degenerate into civil strife? No.
Therefore, in my own capacity as a worthy patriot, volunteer thinktank and progressive mind (not APC please), permit me to advance the following ideas, as workable solutions to the many inflammatory and stomach-churning controversies in the country.
Ranked the most raging argument of the moment, the Ruga policy has been suspended by the government, after stiff resistance from Nigerians, majority of whom are Southerners and who argue the policy is a way of institutionalizing and importing the herders’ carnage to their thresholds. These equally unpatriotic fellows, also complain that it is lopsided and clannish for the government to invest our commonwealth in one ethnic business of grazing. Cowered by this outrage, the federal government has ordered that the Ruga programme be put on hold. Shame.
Personally, I do not agree with the government’s decision to throw in the towel. It is a bad idea to let Ruga, one of the grandest polices of the Next – Level administration, end with some ill-informed parochial regional sentiments. It is unacceptable.
Social commentators and policies analysts have argued that the Ruga policy is well intended, one targeted at achieving an effective and nationwide distribution of the herders’ onslaughts, thereby leading to achieving our time-long mantra of unity in misery—oh, mind not the slip—I really mean in diversity.  They added that the policy has only been poorly communicated by the ever-floundering presidential media team. ‘Imagine the thought of giving cattle better, more civilized, and utopian treatment of nationwide tourism,’ a social analyst thought. ‘Or the genius of creating more ranches for animal kinds, than schools and hospitals for human beings.’ ‘This, surely, will add feathers to our cap among the comity of innovative nations, and prove to the world how far we have progressed as a people, in the Next Level journey,’ he concluded.
So rather than suspend Ruga because of people’s lack of appreciation of its loftiness and relevance to our Next Level mission, I suggest we move all herders, old or young, learned or laity to Maiduguri — specifically Camp Zero, aka Sambisa, for the best global ranching practice. Such ingenious exercise can keep the Sambisa forest — you say of countless daemons? — gainfully active again. We cannot allow that historical land of blood and terror to lie fallow and useless since the Nigerian army hastechnically defeatedits erstwhile occupants  — Boko-Haram.
Long story
short, to the federal government, I propose Sambisa as the best and most
suitable location for the Ruga ranching policy.
Not only that. It has been established by well-meaning observers that the  dysfunctional nature of the presidential media team and its failure in articulating the many grand plans and policies of the government logically and comprehensibly to the people has done devastating damage to the image of our darling president, with many Nigerians calling the president clannish, nepotistic and sentimental in dealings. This, analysts say, has affected the many great programmes of the government from gaining nationwide acceptance and turned the body language of integrity into a body odour of dishonesty.
One southerner, Adeyemi Ogochukwu Tekena, was arguing the other day. He said the clannish tendency of the president is pronounced in certain areas. ‘Forget about political appointments and take a look at the different names given to the different military troops deployed to the different regions by the federal government,’ he suggested.
‘For the north, you are likely to hear civilized and tender names like Operation Lafia Dole (Peace a Must), Operation Sharan Daji (Clear the Bush), Operation Safe the Haven and other peace-accommodating names. But in the South, the names of the troops are always suggestive of terror, brutal force and destruction. Imagine Operation Crocodile Tears,  Python Dance, Lion Roar, Tiger Cry,’ AOT concluded.
Language and communication experts have also advanced  their arguments in defense of the president. They say the president means no harm. All the misconceptions are only often necessitated by the wrong lexical and phrasal choices of the Femi Adeshina-led media team, who does not know the right words in the right order. The analysts, however, unanimously agree that the media team’s incompetency is really undermining the good intentions and the globally-sought integrity of the president. They suggest a complete overhaul of the crew.
Based on this professional submission, I suggest we source another, and as a matter of fact, a more eloquent and oratorically gifted man to head the presidential publicity team, for better image projection and policy articulation. My candidate? The grandiloquent, magniloquent, and linguistically competent  Honorable Patrick Obaihagbon. He only is the man capable of communicating the most complex ideas to Nigerians including the gentle — and sometimes hard men of the press, without objection or questioning. He only can make people accept the most difficult proposition without raising dust.
Therefore,
for better and effective communication of the government policies, I propose as
the head of the presidential media and publicity, venerable lexicographist
Honorable Patrick Obaihagbon.
Another major controversy: Insecurity.  The terror of insecurity nationwide has become more popular than the naira currency, with the allied forces of banditry, herdsmen’s carnage, kidnapping, ritual killings ravaging one or all of the regions of the country. All security agencies, apparatus and approaches have been rendered impotent. This has led some curious Nigerians to question the uncommon sense of having a Defense Minister, Mansur Dan Ali, whose own state Zamfara, is the statutory headquarters of banditry and associated crimes in the country. A round peg in a square hole, critics say. Others added that the fellow is too soft-looking and conciliatory for the serious job of fighting crimes and terror in the country.
While it will be unruly for this proposal to poke nose in the executive decision of ministerial appointment, permit me to nominate as an alternative defence minister and perhaps a better and more efficient replacement for the Zamfara man. Who does the cap fit? His excellency the constituted authority,koseleri— nowkoselemo—  Mr Isiaka Abiola Ajimobi, the former governor of Oyo State. For perfect synergy, I propose a man of zero tolerance for insubordination, a vindictive scholar, veteran deflator ofgra gra, the able man called Abel, Professor Abel Idowu Olayinka, Ibadan varsity Vice-Chancellor and honorary field marshal, as the minister of state for defence.
With proven draconic expertise, tested will for victimization, and an unquenchable zeal to rebuke alternative opinion, these two are obviously the perfect fit for our defence ministry. With them, insecurity can become a fairytale told only by the elders.
Meanwhile, some Nigerians have been in grouses lately with President Muhammadu Buhari. This time, not about Ruga. Not the lopsided political appointment either. Reports say it has to do with the president’s poor travelling form in recent times. Many weeks off-board? Nigerians (home and abroad) argue they have been deprived of the epic comments that come with each travel of the president. Remember the ‘fantastically corrupt’, ‘the shithole’, ‘the other room’, ‘the lazy Nigerian youths’, and many other comments that have now magnified our presence on the world map, all came with the president’s voyages.
This does not
bode well for the President and the country.
Therefore, to help the president regain his travelling form, I humbly suggest that Mr president be placed on an intellectual diet of close reading of Homer’s epic, Odyssey, and Jonathan Swift’s travelogue, Gullivers’ Travels.  This, hopefully, can put Sai Baba again on his tireless voyage. Nigerian can be happy again.
Lastly, Senator Ademola Adeleke  — the legendary dancing senator  — has lost his election petition case at the apex court. Too bad. In spite of the many shreds of evidence informing the court of the ruling party’s unwholesome activities in the Osun election, Adeleke lost. The presiding judge premised verdict on ‘legal technicality’, a term that has since thrown the literate and the unlettered among Nigerians into the puddle of befuddlement.
Justifying the technicality verdict, the bench and the jurists have argued that the concept of technicality in the legal profession is of the exclusive knowledge of senior judges and lawyers in the country, and only applicable in cases where the ruling party and the sitting president have a strong political stake.
They added that such verdict also comes handy when the law tries to forestall a plausible embarrassment of having a dancing governor or one without a common Senior Secondary School Certificate, especially in a land of virtue. The explanation has since laid the controversy to rest.
While Senator Adeleke may have accepted the reality of his illusion, this proposal holds that the absence of such noble merry-maker in the public scenery is highly likely to cause humour strike and irredeemable health damage on Nigerians — especially those with Nigeria-made hypertension.  God forbid bad thing.
To avert such national disaster, I propose that senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke, known for the rare talent of boundless and timeless dance, pool creativity together with nephew Davido and Senator Dino Melaye, as triple-threat entertainers. Imagine the fun magnitude of Baba Shina doing the Shina Rambo, without the distraction of lawmaking or cabinet meeting. That will be an amazing spectacle. Won’t it?
It is hoped that, in a rare spirit of patriotism and civic responsibility,  the few ideas advanced here will go a long way in addressing the bickering and petty annoyances in the country, if graciously and gratefully accepted by concerned individuals, government and corporate bodies.
This is my modest proposal.

"As a Budding Yahoo Boy, Diezani is my Role Model and Future ‘Maga’",https://punocracy.com/as-a-budding-yahoo-boy-diezani-is-my-role-model-and-future-maga/,2019-07-06T09:20:15+01:00,"As Yahoo Boy — whether a newbie who just stumbled on the business or a learned scholar who just started practising but is committed and promising with lofty dreams — one thing you should do more often than not (and cannot afford to miss) is being connected on the internet and being available on all social media networks.
You certainly cannot afford the luxury of missing key events in your local country and other foreign countries depending on how many you can observe. You know why? Well, if you are on the same yahoo street in a yahoo-fertile land as myself, you would know that. But for those wondering and, perhaps, considering joining the booming business which is the future of the nation, here is a tip: you have to be connected to be able to access a variety of dating sites and chat with millions of clients at once! Yes, I mean it. That’s our special ability.
Second, you don’t want to miss the big news. The newspapers always carry big names who are prospective clients whether in your local country or in a foreign clime, just be updated and ready.
Forget the stale definition that “yahoo is the business of scamming oyinbo who exploited, and stole our father’s wealth”; yahoo is now a business of the people for the people and by the people. It has been creatively domesticated. The creative sensibilities and ingenuities of scamming can therefore be explored to accommodate local politicians, cunning bankers, their aide de camps in persons of gatemen, et ce tera.
So while you are scamming white people, you can conveniently and enjoyably scam black people too.
DISCLAIMER: if you are in a school and you are taught how to scam white people alone, please leave! Run for your life and take the next Okada to Abuja. If you are in Lagos, Keke Napep will do. In Abuja you will get the best of the best; I personally recommend Yahoo Model College located opposite the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources.
‘Pathway to World Scamming’: My Story
I have admired yahoo boys since I was seven. Booda Kola, our next door neighbour was always sleeping in the afternoon while his generator was always on at night. His house was always full with girls and boys and luxurious cars. If he was not working all night, he was playing with his girls (you always hear them screaming, disturbing your sleep). If he was not indoors at night, then they are off to club.
Booda Tunji opposite our house always sent me a lot of things (condom, cigarette, spaghetti etc) and gives me change. I like him, he is friendly.
My elder brother, Jibola (Jaybee), was not always at home. He was studying mechatronics engineering in school — he was obsessed with making robots in secondary school. And he littered our house with wires, tins, cans, foams, cartons.
I don’t know where the dream is now all I know is that he was always with Booda Tunji when he got back from school and as soon as daddy bought him a system, he ran away from home. And daddy, extremely angry, disowned him.
Now he has a car. The last time we spoke he said he will buy a car and a house to pacify daddy soon. Jay bee sponsored my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree though. He is a good brother.
It was Booda Tunji that first asked me what I wanted to do when I grow up. I was beside his car waiting for him to give me money. When he asked me, I looked at him and his friends sitting at the back of his car and exclaimed: “walahi talahi mo fe sha she!”
My father wanted me to be a farmer — he would say an “Agriculturist”. He still believes the Agricultural sector is the spring of wealth, the nation is blind to.
“Or you can be a Doctor, Engineer or if you want, read lawyer”.
“Ha ha ha!” I would burst into laughter, “read Lawyer!”
He doesn’t understand that my mind is made up and couldn’t believe it when I told him I had enrolled for a Bachelor’s degree in “Cyber Fraud and Masterful Scamming”. His two sons are cyber fraudsters!
I have a Masters now though. I graduated with Distinction from the International School of Crimes (ISC) with MSC in International Wire and Scamming Beyond National Boundaries. My thesis was on “Decrypting Global Codes: Pathway to World Scamming”; feel free to congratulate me.
Great Headline Gives Double Joy
A politician, Diezani is the first female President of OPEC – the Organization of Petroleum-related Embezzlers and Criminals. She was minister of transportation in 2007 before she moved to Mines and Steal Development in 2008, and was appointed Minister of Petroleum Resources in 2010.
As a Budding Yahoo Boy, Diezani is my Role Model and Future ‘Maga’. I admire her a lot. There is nothing that has given me joy like the news of her enormous wealth and her remarkable proclivity and outstanding knowledge of the principles of “Modern Theft and Robbery”.
The recent news of her forfeiture of her jewelry worth $40million leaves me awestruck and my jaw dropping. The amount being around 14 billion 400 million Nigerian Naira.
“Wonderful! Wonderful! Mama mama o!” I just kept exclaiming and raising two hands in the air for one person.
Imagine that! 419 bangles, 315 rings, 304 earrings, I89 wristwatches, 267 necklaces, and a customised gold iPhone. Diezani must have had a million hands, a million necks, a million ears and a million fingers and may be more.
Wait, they didn’t mention noserings and navel-rings? Did EFCC miss it or the rings ran away. They could have escaped with her to the UK – these are extremely private stuff really. I mean, does the government have a navel to put such rings or a nose?
Did you read some literary texts, am I about to reel out classical epithets, “you know wah ‘m sayin'”? If Diezani were to be theDevil on the Crossby Ngugi wa Thiong’o she would be an ambassador for “Modern Theft and Robbery” Association (did I tell you, I was recently made a distinguished fellow of this association, well, thanks to my Masters’ thesis). If it were to be inOliver Twistby Honourable Charles Dickens, then Diezani would the “Artful Dodger”.
By and large, I admire her masterful knowledge of the art and craft of “Modern Theft and Robbery”. She is a worthy role model. And because I admire her, she has worthily won a coveted space in my honour roll of future ‘magas’. Soon, my internet server will locate her in the UK, I will roll in billions and the rest they say will be history.
Don’t you think she probably has more, if she could leave such huge amount of jewelry and escape to London? Well then, we can share the rest— ha ha ha! Apt, my scamming knowledge is at work!
They Say No Telephone to Heaven, But Not Mobile Phone
With a customized gold iPhone, Diezani would certainly be able to call either heaven or hell – I can’t say which.
But the phone is too precious that calling preternatural forces will be the least of its functions. Even if apple doesn’t state it there. You imagine it.
I am not sure what Alison will tell God or Devil though. Only she can tell. May be, she will ask “why am I endowed with the appetite of 243,333+ people?”"
"Nigeria’s grand ayatolla, Abba Kyari re-appoints self as chief of staff",https://punocracy.com/nigerias-grand-ayatolla-abba-kyari-re-appoints-self-as-chief-of-staff/,2019-07-06T07:39:19+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Alternate reports reaching us say Abba Kyari has finally re-appointed himself as the federal government’s Chief of Staff.
In a letter of notification to presidential spokesman Garba Shehu on Friday, he directed that the announcement be made of his decision.
“Don’t say anything yet about ministerial appointments,” Kyari had instructed. “We have not made up our minds, and are making sure the embarrassing mistake of appointing dead people doesn’t re-occur.”
The T.A. Report gathered from somewhat reliable sources that President Muhammadu Buhari wasn’t even aware of the release until much later into the night when the first lady, Aisha, nagged about it.
It will be recalled that Shehu has always been at the forefront in Kyari’s line of defence as he releasespress statementsto clear the latter’s name each time there’s a scandal involving him.
Reacting to the development, Amos Bantu, president of the Democracy for All Project (DAP), said he has lost hope in the clear-headedness of Muhammadu Buhari and his ability to lead independent of questionable influences.
“It is clear Kyari is not only the chief of Buhari’s staff, he also has him by the balls,” Bantu said.
“If anyone knows how I can get one or two of Diezani’s rings, please help me. I need to flee this country ASAP,” he added jokingly.
Kyari has been described fondly in many quarters. In relation to Buhari, some have called him Nigeria’s Grand Ayatolla and Supreme Leader while Buhari is the president. Some say he is the remote control while Buhari is the television.
But whatever it is you call the man, it is obvious the steering wheels of the administration’s Next Level bus are firmly in his grip, and the other man is just a loud-voiced conductor giving instructions about change.

Who needs a Canadian visa?,https://punocracy.com/who-needs-a-canadian-visa/,2019-07-05T07:59:59+01:00,"By: Akin Oseni
In Nigeria is God’s plenty. But how much do Nigerians know of such divine blessing and benison upon the fatherland?
Mind not the media grumbling, the mumbling and the rumbling over the state of affairs. The Ruga debate. Poverty. Kidnapping. Banditry. And their most recent recurring siblings: anointing rape and executive assault. All those are Brechtian elements that make a perfect plot in an absurdist theatre like ours.
Imagine the exponential rate at which events overturn events, stories stumble on stories and scandals surface on the heels of scandals—to the delight of quick-witted observers who are literally and literarily catching the jokes.
So who needs a Canadian visa—an exile into some foreign land of lasting boredom? Being a Nigerian, you are born too great and too blessed for that exercise of flooding the embassy and waiting for hours, only to get a ‘Nay’ stamp from one blond-skinned woman who only mumbles some unintelligible phrases through the nose. Wrong.
You see, you really need no travelling visa. Why searching for greener pasture when our national fabric is already made of green? You need no job either (Nigeria is not assuring you one, after all) to survive the country’s drama. All you need are a nose for trending gossips, sharp sense of humour, a functioning and functional smartphone and a network that is smart—indeed and not only in wording.  Then, of course, you must be an active citizen of the Twittersphere for maximum enjoyment of the country’s theatrics.
Because here,
in Naija,  is where ugly narratives
culminate in dark comedy, in mockery of national troubles.
Start with the COZA thriller — the sub-plot of protest and counter-protest in Abuja. A group of ladies and men faithful to the randy daddy G.O, it was reported, had hit the COZA church to protest against the anti-rape protesters. Their argument? It is profane and blasphemous to drag the body of  Krest…oh no, of  Christ in the in petty and muddy allegation of rape. But while the Lord was busy attending celestial matters, the earthly foot soldiers had deemed it fit to come in defence of His anointed. ‘It is not the body of Christ we are dragging in the mud, it is a serial rapist we have come to drag to the prison,’ the other camp protested.  Matter laid to rest.
Then Winter is …ops… Pardon! the BBNaija is here — that ostentatious TV reality, the one that gets you piqued and sometimes, forces you to self-criticism, for the four to six years you spent at the University when another — a wiser — compatriot is coasting home with N60 million worth of rewards — for appearing vulgar, lewd and loud before the camera for ninety days. The reality of our humour or the humour of our reality, you say?
Most of the inmates — oh sorry — I mean housemates, report says, are more American than Trump or more British than May. They talk in rustic (rhotic rather) accent, to the displeasure of their less-fortunate Nigerian audience, most of whom have not been to the airport and who fancy a domesticated and real Reality Show.  A friend told me how he had thought one of the housemates was calling the first name of the Ghanaian poet (Awoonor) when she was indeed saying ‘I wanna.’
Enter the Nigerian media mob. They have taken to Twitter to challenge the organisers on why those that went for the audition — jumped fences, climbed walls and ran a marathon in Lagos did not make it to the House. Savage. But a friend privileged to be close to the publicity head of the BBN crew, but who does not want his name in print, has confided in me that BBNaija Season 4 has actually been designed as a two-phase event: The Reality and The Show. He said the runners, the jumpers and the climbers in Lagos were for the Reality, and now, the London and Yankee returnees are in for the Show. Simple.
What of the sexy senator Elisha Abbo, the youngest senator in the country and one of the beneficiaries of the curse (I mean the cause) of  Not-too-Young-to Ru(i)n? Caught in the CCTV footage, his eminence was seen bashing, whacking and cursing a lady attendant in a sex shop. The lady’s erring: not attending the revered senator and his accompanying paramours with respect, using a phone while his lordship talked, among others.  The drama has got Nigerians talking and calling for the head of the poor senator, even after a video apology.
Trust the gossip verve of Nigerians on social media.  Some of them have twisted the tale and digressed from the main matter. A fellow was asking on Twitter why the senator needed to shop for adult toys, when he had those three paramours already in attendance. ‘It is the evidence of the strength and virility of the Nigerian youth we have been yearning for in our politics,’ replied Born Savage, another Twitter user. ‘The Not-too-Young-to -Ru(i)n movement is paying off,’ he added.
Meanwhile, an age-long associate of Senator Elisha Abbo who goes by the name Kamuzu Banda has aired his opinion on the allegation of assault and humiliation levelled against the senator. He said the bashing and battering of the lady attendant was the senator’s way of promoting his side hustle. He added that there is an unwritten law that every member of the Red Chamber must have a side hustle, to be cited as a revenue source in case of any misappropriation charge by the meddlesome anti-graft agencies.
‘I am sure you know Senator Melaye is a born songwriter, (former) senator  Ademola Adeleke is a dancer, the incumbent deputy senate president (Ovie Omo-Agege) is a UTO (Union Tax Officer) aka Agbero. For Elisha Abo, it is kickboxing,’ he added. He pleaded with Nigerians to treat the matter with clemency, and that they should temper justice with mercy, especially at the Social Media Criminal Court, SMCC.
In other news, Dr Dame Patience Faka Jonathan aka Mama Peace is, again, in the news. Chai! This time, not because of ‘the blood they are sharing’ in the country.  No. It is something else which is capable of forcing the devil to tears. Mama has just forfeited to the federal government of Nigeria, a startling and mouth-watering sum of N9.2 billion and another $8.4 million, which they say are the proceeds of grafts that characterised the President Jonathan shoeless regime.
But the typically vociferous Mama Peace, through her lawyer, has contested the charge saying it was unfair and slanderous for anybody or group to allege her of looting since nobody has declared any money missing from the coffers of the government. The former first lady was particularly referring to those impetuous busybodies, who have flagrantly tagged her the female specimen of the former military dictator, Gen. Sanni Abacha — in the business of looting and laundering.
Some noble-hearted Nigerians, who saw sense in the first lady’s argument that she should not be tagged a looter since no money is missing from the government’s treasury, are planning to apply the same logic in defence of the former head of state, General Sanni Abacha. A group called Association of Right Fighters for the Oppressed Deceased (ARFOD) has been commissioned to advance the cause of exonerating the former head of state from the hitherto looting charge.
Using Mama Peace’s syllogism, the Secretary to ARFOD, Mr Fatoks Mai Coza, said the group will justify the innocence of Gen. Sanni Abacha through their lawyer in the court. He said they will also negotiate a return of the money recovered from the deceased since over a decade to the Abacha family, and perhaps request damages and apologies from the federal government of Nigeria and the people, for the allegation of looting against the late General, since no dime has been declared missing by the country.
These are the
few of the narratives that have made Nigeria the humour capital of the world in
recent weeks.
So, with these and many more on the way,  who really needs a Canadian visa?

It’s not rape… it’s consented rape,https://punocracy.com/its-not-rape-its-consented-rape/,2019-07-04T13:09:44+01:00,"By: Chuks Chinyere (jj)
Who would have thought there were several types of rape: domestic, street, corrective, and several others. There’s also consented rape. I mean, rape used to be easily defined as “a forced sexual activity that involves penetration”, yes? Apparently, a precise definition of this vile activity is not enough. To fully understand things, we have to segment rape into different classes, one of which is consented rape.
So, what is consented rape? As my SS1 Agric Science teacher loved to say, “it’s self-explanatory,abi”?
Consented rape is the type of rape whose victim gives consent to their rapist to forcefully engage them in penetrative sexual activity. Most times, this consent is given without their (the victims’) knowledge. Other times, the victims are threatened to relinquish control of their body, thus consent.
In the activity of consented rape, the victim might suffer bruises and wounds from struggles with their rapist like in regular rape situations but, not to worry, experts have assured us that consented rape is very much different from other kinds of rape because, notwithstanding the kicking and scratching, the forcing and exploitation, the tears and trauma afterwards, consent was given, that’s all that matters.
“Body no be firewood na”, “Why did you wear that dress?”, “What were you doing in the company of five boys at that time of the day?”, “The way she was rocking me at that party eh, I knew she was asking for it.”Just a few of the things wey Musa don hear for gate this year, him ear never full sha.
How does this consented rape thing worksef? Well, if that your fine neighbour comes to charge her phone in your flat again, wearing that her skin-tight leggings, that black one that shows her pant lines — yes, that exact one that gives you brain bursts and wild thoughts… Okay, maybe she’s not wearing those black near-transparent leggings this time; maybe it’s that her red bum shorts in the company of that big white Real Madrid jersey, with no underwear.
She dares to let her plus-size double D boobs jiggle freely like a pendulum, knowing full well how much you can’t resist boobs. Even if she doesn’t know about your lust for the mammary glands, it doesn’t matter. What matters is she dares come into your apartment looking hotter than Kylie Jenner and Kim K. put together, making your soldier salute her. She dares combine red and white —odindivalentine colours. My friend, the experts said I should tell you that, if you forcefully have penetrative sexual activity with her, there and then, while she’s trying to quickly reply her WhatsApp texts, it’s called consented rape.
The best part is, its not even as bad as the original rape. Why? Because she said “take me daddy” with her body language, and you as Daddy Taker, General Overtaker that you are, had to do the needful.
Body no be firewood bros.
Homeboy, life of the party, y’all were at this bash, yea? Bottoms upping, loud music, dancefloorissa madt thang, everybody was on Cloud Nine, and this shawty was all up on you on the dance floor, she giving you the wickedest whine, she definitely feeling your vibe man. It’s past midnight and she doesn’t seem like she wants to leave the party, some of her friends were leaving but she said she good, she’s still sipping on the weird mixture and blowing smoke with ’em boys. I mean, if it’s not sex she’s looking for, then what else could she be hanging around till after 12 forfam?
So you keep your eye on her, she stands and walks up to the restroom, you follow her, you quickly check your wallet for a condom, you find none, it doesn’t matter, there won’t be time to put one on, you ’bout to take it by force like the Bible said you should, according to your Pastor.
You barge into the ladies; first thing, your hands on her mouth so she doesn’t scream. She’s wearing a short jean skirt, it’s easy to reach for her panties, you pull it down, you pull the skirt up; you so fast, so skilled like you were made for this. She stops struggling when she realises you are in. After a few thrusts, you’re done. You clean up and walk out feeling like Lebron. You don’t have to worry so much; that was not rape, just consented rape.
After all, when the victim came out of the restroom, she didn’t say a word. She didn’t act like she was raped. None of that. She must have liked it. See the way she’s going about her business like nothing happened. She enjoyed o, probably wants more.
Months later, her parents are not saying anything to your parents. Her big brothers are still cool with you. She obviously did not tell anybody. My guess is, she’s cool with some consented rape. She gave you content to rape her by dancing and smiling at you. Don’t let nobody lie to you that she loathes you and is planning on how to stab you for taking away her sanity. She is not going through any deep trauma; the depths of her head are calm like the sea Jesus spoke peace to. She’s Gucci-fine.
Consented rape is such a beautiful thing, don’t you think? Asides the quick less than two minutes pleasure it has in stock for you, it is also evidence of your intuition. It takes a very intuitive mind to know when a victim is saying  “yes” without saying anything or screaming “no”; you got to be smart to know.
Consented rape can take you places, one of which is prison — maybe an early grave too if you find someone generous and crazy enough to help with transportation.
Consented rape is beautiful; it’s so good that it has contributed so much to what the world is today, yes. Some many years ago, legends have it that the Roman Kingdom came to its abrupt end to give birth to the Roman Republic as a result of Sextus Tarquinius’s — last crown prince of the Roman Kingdom — consented rape with Lucretia, wife of Collatinus, commander of the Roman army. Lucretia committed suicide after narrating her ordeal in the hands of Sextus to her husband and her father Spurius Lucretius, who was a Prefect of Rome.
Lucretius asked that her death be avenged. They, with the help of other nobles, overthrew and exiled the royal family who had been ruling very terribly for decades. They then established the Roman Republic whose system of governance and civilisation has contributed immensely to our world today. So you see, consented rape is not such a bad thing after all."
Nigerians shocked as new study shows pastors aren’t really that different,https://punocracy.com/nigerians-shocked-as-new-study-shows-pastors-arent-really-that-different/,2019-06-30T22:44:38+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Pastors aren’t superhuman and are very capable of doing the same things every other person born of a woman does, new revolutionary research has shown.
The report launched in Abuja, on Saturday, by the Commonsensically Objective Scientists’ Association (COSA) has however been received with great suspicion by Nigerians. It has also generated heated controversy, with some accusing the researchers, many of whom are agnostics, of being biased against the house of God.
“We know it may sound far-fetched to many but our findings show that clergymen actually fart, shit, eat, sleep, lust after attractive people, and do all sorts of other things that make us human,” Dr Williams Aig-Imoukhuede, the association’s president told journalists.
“We need to understand that pastors, and religious leaders generally, are men first before they are men of God.
“In fact, studies have shown that they are not immune to erring and committing crimes such as making false statements, extortion, fraud,” the professor of Theological Physics added. “Not even sexual assault.”
The study also found, contrary to popular belief, that the titles “pastor” and “anointed” are really not synonymous. Aig-Imoukhuede recommended that religious leaders should be presumed innocent until proven guilty like everyone else, but they must never be acquitted without trial.
“This is outrageous!” said one church leader who gave his name simply as BF and claimed to be the world’s best pastor.
“I am not only disappointed, but I am alsokrestfallenthat people can go to this extent to tarnish the image of the church. We all know pastors are called by God and God only calls people who are worthy to spread his word and seeds,” he said.
“Even if a pastor does a thing that is thought by the world to be immoral or against the law, he must not be condemned for the ways of the Lord are mysterious and are beyond human understanding. It is just absurd to equate pastors with other men, including unbelievers.”
Pastors are literally worshipped in Nigeria. Analysts say they not only hold sway over 10 per cent of their followers’ pockets, they also control virtually 100 per cent of their minds.
“People naturally need to have complete trust in some authority,” one expert suggested. “And since the politicians have brutally let them down, Nigerians automatically moved to their religious leaders.”
“They constantly let them down too, but it’s difficult to track because pastors themselves make the rules. If they break them, they simply rewrite those rules and life goes on as though nothing happened.”

A traveller’s guide to enjoying Ekiti State; Nigeria’s yahoo yahoo capital.,https://punocracy.com/a-travellers-guide-to-enjoying-ekiti-state-nigerias-yahoo-yahoo-capital/,2019-06-21T09:31:26+01:00,"You must be totally alien to the Federal Republic of Twitter, or the geographic sensation known as Nigeria, to not know the popular dictum“I am in sifia pain… if anything should happen to me, you’ll be held responsible”.
When former Governor Peter Ayodele Fayose’s theatrics went viral, people wondered what special resources Ekiti State owned for a sitting governor to have been handicapped by policemen (as in, they -reportedly so- broke his hand, and teargassed him) to protect the state. To have an Eagle’s eye perspective of the fountain of knowledge, we sent our correspondence, Peculiar Mess, to visit the state, and here is his special report.
Ekiti State, home to the largest domination of sub-Yoruba speakers, is one of the most fascinating States to visit in Nigeria. Surrounded by a mall of rocks, and a party of rivers, the state prides itself in humble representation, and affordable living.
At night, and during the day, Ekiti State is a beauty to behold aesthetically. With a multi-million dollar economy, Ekiti is one of the most flourishing places in Nigeria, contributing about 96% of the country’s GDP.
The economy of Ekiti State is hinged on the intellectual prowess of young citizens who engage in Internet fraud to reclaim the lost glory, cultural artefacts, and long forgotten dignity of Nigerians from former colonists across the world; especially as a reprisal for the trans-atlantic slave trade.
Beating Ogbomoso (another renowned home for hardworking Internet fraudsters) hands down, it has been said that people come from far and wide to learn the art of Internet fraud in Ekiti state, from students in different tertiary institutions including the renowned Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti.
Known for its peaceful government transitions, Ekiti State owes its democratic advancement to having the largest congregation of Professors in the country, with a startling level of humility in the crimes happening in Ekiti. Speaking to an indigene, Mr. Fatoba, on crimes in Ekiti, he revealed that “we do rituals a lot in this place, but they’ll ask you to donate yourself before they use you, we don’t really force people to use them”.
While armed robbery and kidnapping is not a thriving business in Ekiti State, you may lose a finger, or an ear if you annoy your neighbours. The Government of the state also takes proactive steps in preventing crime, a notable example being an appeal to the Federal government in 2018 to send soldiers to Ekiti State, over a little suspicion of kidnapping and armed robbery on their high ways.
While Ekiti is not equipped with modern shopping outlets, cinemas, or anything to show it is following the decadent ways of the Internet age, especially with crippling network connectivity, the state is known to entertain visitors with Pounded Yam and Vegetable and stable electricity supply, which allows the industrious youth of the State to work all night, and drive into any of the over one thousand hotels and bars in the state, to make some necessary noise during the day.
Ekiti is the life of the party, as there’s always a party going on in every corner at every hour of the day, and this, we discovered is necessary in order to maintain Ekiti’s busy and bustling image that Lagos is struggling to catch up to.
Famed for the Fayose overhead bridge, Ekiti denizens are humble trekkers, who occasionally cramp themselves in cars and mini-buses, in order to help conserve and expand the lifespan of their roads. While it has been rumoured that denizens often visit the colourful Fayose overhead bridge in awe and fascination, Mr. Fadairo Atiba, chairman of Ado Local Government Area has mentioned that people only like to visit the flyover for fresh air.
Attempting to drink from the literal fountain of knowledge, located at Ikogosi, our reporter was warned to make his voyage only early in the morning, as the road leading to the popular tourist site is motorable at that time alone. Visiting later in the day would attract accidents, because gods come out to play, and may confuse revving engine of cars as a threat to the peace of the state.
Our visit to Ekiti can only be described as an exciting, nerve pulling, and a jaw-dropping near-death experience, one which we look forward to taking, in our next existence as humans; as too much of this goodness at a go can kill you.
Peculiar Mess reporting,

"Senator Omo-Agege may have stolen INEC server, sources say",https://punocracy.com/senator-omo-agege-may-have-stolen-inec-server-sources-say/,2019-06-15T20:58:05+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Various sources at the national assembly and the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) headquarters say Ovie Omo-Agege, Nigeria’s newly (s)elected Deputy Senate President, may have been awarded the contract of making the electoral commission’s server miraculously disappear.
Omo-Agege, a lawyer and lawmaker, is notorious for his ability to cause anything to vanish from sight (including the rule of law and common sense as we know it).
He is also famous for his remarkable talent of breaking into any place—no matter how secure, committing treason in broad daylight, and not only getting away with it but ensuring to get a raise too.
Apparently last year, the fearless senator, alongside his professional associates from the underworld, successfully stole the mace from the Senate chamber, nearly causing anarchy.
“Only this man has the skills and resources to pull off such a heist,” an official of the electoral commission told our correspondent on Saturday. “Don’t be surprised if the INEC server is found under a pedestrian bridge like the mace was, or maybe put up for sale as fairly used at the Computer Village in Lagos.”
Some other sources have, however, theorised that the culprit could have been the money-swallowing snake that burgled JAMB’s vault. It is very likely it struck the deal with the presidency in exchange for amnesty or a seat at the table, they hinted.
“INEC is too embarrassed to come clean, and so they have resorted to pretending the server was never there in the first place,” one fellow said.
Meanwhile, there are reports suggesting that the federal government may be considering Omo-Agege for a national medal for his role in making sure Nigeria’s visit to the Next Level is not shortlived.
It is yet to be decided which is more fitting for the soon-to-be-crowned national hero: Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR) or Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR).

How to be a student of the University of Ibadan,https://punocracy.com/how-to-be-a-student-of-the-university-of-ibadan/,2019-06-14T08:00:22+01:00,"Hey, are you an intending student of Nigeria’s premier university? Or you’re already a student of the school? This is for you.
Maybe you don’t know — or you know but you need a refresher — UI, Nigeria’s first, is Nigeria’s best. This is not my random thought. Ask Webnometics how they arrived at that.
Being a student of the school is a great privilege. Because if it is from Ibadan, it has to be the best. In fact, some Poly (The Polytechnic, Ibadan) or FSS (Federal School of Statistics) students, when asked where they school, would reply saying Ibadan. They wouldn’t bother clarifying that it isn’t UI. They are good like that.
Now that resumption is in few days, it is the best time to release this long list of guides on how to be a student of the school, after weeks of panel discussions on having this completed. Just for you.
You see, as a student, your first obligation is to keep your studentship. Many have lost their studentship for a number of reasons. Except you are rude or lack home training, don’t go about showing contempt or insulting yourin loco parentis. Someone who didn’t hearken to this advice went on Facebook to insult the VC. He graduated with his one-year juniors (could have been two years).
Whenever the school does anything against your will, be not among those who would protest. Don’t you ever. Except your studentship is not dear to you. At best, be an intellectual dummy: learn to keep shut when you should talk and see no bad in managerial mediocrity. You shall graduate.
Add to that, don’t ever dare challenge leadership. In UI, we live by the African culture that Elders are never wrong. Your job is not to ask questions. Your job is to do as you’re told. You’re in school to read and graduate. So don’t be distracted. Except you want to be pegged back like a certain nosey reporter who dared write. Or a beardless 200-level who led protests. Save your head. Leave your tongue in your mouth. Don’t bring it out. Management is never wrong. And remember that you are a bloody undergraduate who has no experience.
Now that you must have had your admission secured, it is time to know how to live in the school. But first, you have to know that accommodation is not guaranteed in the school’s hostel, except you are new or in your final year. If you secure a room, lucky you. If you don’t, there are rooms outside the school, get one. Life is about struggle. After all, you struggled before you could best the millions of sperm cells that competed with you during your formative moment.
For those in the hostel, use its facilities anyhow. Cook in the room. Use hotplate. Throw water through the balcony. Paying fine is not your problem. Don’t sweep or scrub your room in weeks or even months. Don’t clean your windows even though they are dusty. When you’re sick, that’s why Jaja is there for you. If you’re an ardentchurchite, you can even turn your room to an appendage of your fellowship. Your roommates have no right to complain. Don’t they believe in God?
You need not stop there. You need to show how good God has been to you by proclaiming His name in the open. Always raise your voice so much that your peers would be jealous of your loudness. Some of them would be angry that you don’t want them to sleep; don’t mind them. They are evil. Worship your Lord by ensuring your peers feel you. Err…lest I forget, you can use anywhere from the lawns to the cafeteria, from the road to the classroom. Blessed are those who do this for theirs is the feeling of joy.
You must have been, by now, spiritually fortified; you’re covered. When in the classroom, you are free to destroy the university’s properties. Remember you paid for it. And, of course, the school doesn’t repair unless there is damage. Ignore others that haven’t got a place to sit, book a seat for a friend of yours who is yet to arrive. Just say,“Someone is there”to wade people off the seat. You are only being your brother’s keeper. Perhaps, that your friend may not show up in the end, don’t be apologetic to those you denied a seat. Just pretend as if all is well.
You also would need to be your brother’s keeper during elections.  To vote, your Muslim or Christian brethren is your sure candidate. Forget what the candidate can do. Forget his credibility. The name Brother John or Sister Jameelah is enough to guide your choice.
And for you who was lucky enough to get the mandate of the students, rejoice. It’s pomp and pageantry for you! But tread gently, you must be loyal to the Elders of your Hall. The Elders, maybe not necessarily be elderly, can make you bite the dust; so you have to give them their dues. There would be time a big politician would donate money to your constituency, be a cheerful giver, especially to those loyal to you. Don’t be an ingrate.
Hey, you also need an Eve or an Adam, depending on your gender.  You need a girlfriend or boyfriend. He/she would be your backup in the time of penury and erotic need. This shouldn’t stop you from going to church or mosque the next day o. After all,“those that claim holy are the baddest”. So don’t pretend. What is in your heart is what matters. Your deeds don’t count so much. By the way, the surest time to enjoy life is when you are in school, not when you graduate into the world of hustle. Add to that, you need experience before marriage. Get it from the best teacher.
Don’t make reading outside your syllabus a choice. It is not really necessary. Many people have tried it and it failed. This is why I’m warning you. During the exam, you cram. Read days to exams and test. When you get an A, tell the world you earned it! When you get a D, tell the world the lecturer gave you. If you know your way, you can also use what you have to get what you want. Don’t mind those that say people don’t buy mark in UI. They are liars. It is not sure they will make heaven. I wish you success.
Greatest UItes, there you have it! In case you try these guides and they fail, I guarantee you tuition-free scholarship into any other Nigerian university of your choice. 🤓
Happy resumption. Welcome back to school!"
How to celebrate Democracy Day,https://punocracy.com/how-to-celebrate-democracy-day/,2019-06-12T07:39:27+01:00,"By:Hamzat Mariam
Whether it is May 29 or June 12, Democracy Day is Democracy Day and you are sure to get a break from work—if you are in Nigeria. Even luckily, as a civil servant, you get two days off while some private organisations might have given one. So, if you wish to celebrate Democracy Day in the best style as a Nigerian, you’ve come to the right place!
Democracy day is for every Nigerian, so don’t let anyone deceive you. It is your birthright to enjoy and an opportunity to wallow in your democratic freedom and power whether you are in Nigeria or in the diaspora.
Spend the morning arguing with your neighbours on the current state of Nigeria. God knows this country has a long way to go. Argue the fact that the government is the problem, or you may even say it’s the people who keep electing the wrong leaders (whichever side you choose goes; you are entitled to your opinion).
You can even argue that Nigeria shouldn’t have adopted the democratic form of government since you have unconfirmed facts and figures on past events.
Afterwards, you are free to spend the rest of the day online. Continue broadcasting some historical and political messages forwarded to you and even share on your Facebook timeline. Then, reply the comments under them as soon as they come in.  Join the #democracyday trends on Twitter if there’s any and badmouth Nigeria’s political system or pray or it (whichever you feel is deserved).
As a Nigerian in the diaspora, there are things you could do too. Join the Twitter trends and share your highly polished foreign opinion on the way forward for Nigeria. It is not as if many of the day-to-day problems affect you but still, talk your own. Compare Nigeria’s democracy to some other countries’ and even compare the contrasting levels of development. Tell us why Nigeria is yet to develop and don’t forget to proffer solutions that seem to be eluding everyone else who isn’t as ‘exposed’.
If you hold a position in government like being the President or the Governor, then know that you should give a speech on your hopes, plans, and aspiration for the country. Nigerians are waiting to see your face at a convention, parade, or something. Make sure you show up on TV and say something headline-worthy.
As a cleric, you can also turn democracy day to a crusade. Let your members pray to the God who gave the masses power over enemies. You can have themes such as ‘My Democracy’, ‘Power to Destroy the Enemies’ etc. You can even make it June 12 election-related with themes like ‘Give me My Right’, ‘ I Want My Glory’ …
As an activist, it is
up to you to condemn the system of democracy in Nigeria. Use instances of election
and every other thing that could get you attention. Democracy grants freedom,
use it!
Dear average Nigerian youth who simply wants to join in on conversations, tune down the volume of your Dagrin’sDemocracy. Complain and find fault in something while sitting under your parent’s roofs inactive.
Ps:Enjoy Democracy day your own way and don’t let those ‘illiterates’ who have little or no knowledge of past events spoil it for you. They won’t see things your way even if you shove it down their throat. Therefore, avoid social media banters and be the sensible one."
If Nigerians adopted Buhari’s odd approach to assets declaration…,https://punocracy.com/if-nigerians-adopted-buharis-odd-approach-to-assets-declaration/,2019-05-30T13:24:47+01:00,"President Muhammadu Buhari has, in compliance with the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, submitted his assets declaration forms to the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB, which by law must precede his oath-taking slated for tomorrow, May 29th.
The duly completed forms were submitted to the Chairman of the CCB, Professor Mohammed Isa, on behalf of the President by Sarki Abba, Senior Special Assistant, Household and Domestic Affairs.
The forms, as signed by the President and sworn to before a Judge of Abuja High Court, showed no significant changes in assets as declared in 2015 by him.
There are no new houses, no new bank accounts at home and abroad and there are no new shares acquired.
The Chairman of the CCB commended the President for leading by example by declaring his assets in accordance with the law.
Garba ShehuSenior Special Assistant to the President(Media & Publicity)May 28, 2019
A defendant to the judge:
“My lord, I swear! I did not kill that man. It’s a blatant lie. All the things the prosecution is saying are not true. I have plenty evidence that will prove my innocence before this court and I have shown my lawyer, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria. He said my lord will strike out the case with that amount of incontrovertible evidence. In fact, I know who really committed the murder. But unfortunately, I cannot tell you any of this or show you the evidence. You have to believe me.”
A husband to his wife:
“My dear, I cannot afford to buy you a new phone o. You know my salary is just N30,000. I have been earning that same amount since 1989, and you know now there is even inflation again. My promotion to Deputy Director added no significant increment to my pay. You want to check my bank statement? Haba now! I won’t lie to you. Everything is with the account department at the office. They’ll bear me witness.”
A footballer about his age:
“Wallahi, I am one of the youngest people on the national team. I am only 15 years old. Don’t pay attention to these wrinkles on my face o; that is how we used to have it in our village. When I was born sef, the doctor thought I had spent two years in my mama’s belly, but it was the normal nine months. All my teeth don already come out. If you ask my mom, she will tell you the same thing. Though she died of heart attack three months ago.”
Politician commissioning project:
“My people! My people! I hereby donate to this community, out of my goodwill and generosity as a token to thank you for your support, this ultra-modern gigantic hospital. It may look like just one building, but there are many more hidden behind it. Inside, you have everything you can think of: Defibrillators, anaesthesia machines, patient monitors, EKG machines, radiotherapy machines, surgical tables, and so on. You can’t go in for treatment though even if you can afford to, but I assure you all these things are inside. The only thing missing are the doctors, but at least now you can boast of having an ULTRA-MODERN HOSPITAL, first-of-its-kind in the town.
Job applicant to interviewer:
“I am the perfect candidate for this job sir. Finished with a first class from the University of Nigeria, and summa cum laude from the University of Toronto, Canada. I was the best graduating student; I even broke a 200-year-old record at the department. I have work experience of over 50 years even though I’m only 27. This is from working full-time for five companies at the same time. You can ask my former employers sir. My credentials? Why I don’t have them here? Er… Sir, I kept them at the bank, but it got liquidated in 2017. So… What do you say?(smiles sheepishly).“
Mother to her son:
“Heyy Junior! Uncle gave me N5000 to give you when he came last week. Where is it? See his mouth like where’s the money. Don’t worry. I have opened an account for you at Access Bank. I even added N1000 to it. When you grow older and you’re ready to marry wife, I will hand over everything to you. You hear?Ehn ehn.”
Doctor to his patient:
“Congratulations Mr Yusuf! We are happy to inform that you are now well and have been officially discharged by the hospital. Don’t worry sir, though we haven’t done the surgery yet, our test results show that you no longer have lung cancer and diabetes. It’s all gone! Miraculous, isn’t it? Though we also need the bed you are using so that we can admit the senator’s son who just broke his leg, but that is besides the point. Sheer coincidence. Ha-ha.  And no sir, you cannot see the test results. Our printer is faulty and we couldn’t get any hard copies. Have a nice day, Mr Yusuf!”
Random blogger:
“Eight years ago, my sugar daddy threw me out of his one-bedroom apartment. Today, I have built myself a mansion that is times ten in size. I picked up all the stones he threw at me, gave them to bricklayers, and they came up with this beautiful house. I don’t even know how they did it. I became too strong and fortified. I am a child of grace and, yes, this is a testimony that dreams do come true. Yes? Why am I not taking pictures inside the building? Oh, that’s because my ex-sugar daddy forgot to throw a key too. I’ll go and ask him … Also, you know, my pastor has to bless the place first.”
Etc. etc. etc."
Dear newly sworn-in government officials …,https://punocracy.com/dear-newly-sworn-in-government-officials/,2019-05-29T20:06:44+01:00,"By:Busari Azeezat
​Dear newly sworn-in government officials,
Congratulations! You made it to the seat. Do not forget the promises you made to get there. Do not forget to be the example of good governance and democracy just like you painted yourselves to be before you won the race.
You see, we Nigerians are now aware more than ever about our rights. We understand policies enough, we also know that most of your promises are our rights in the first place. But we let you bring them to our tables as promises any way because, truly, we do not think you have anything better to offer.
Distinguished government officials,
Be aware that we are all watching: through our android phones, Facebook and on Twitter. Our tweet warriors are ever ready in their thousands to tweet fire and water. Our data subscription, although renewed through thick and thin, is always on point. Whether or not you heed, we would not hesitate to hold you accountable for everything you do.
Our street and radio raters are ever ready to engage in the debate about who has done better betweenLágbájáandTameduand if the N-Power N30,000 is enough to drive the development we dream of or to reduce the unemployment rate of our country.
We assure you that market men and women, amidst theirkarakatawould talk. Cast blames as usual as to why the cost ofAnkarais high and even hint their buyers that price of petrol might increase soon.
Ah yes! The prayer warriors won’t be left out! They’ll call on God in their places of worship to punish whosoever it is that is punishing them.
Baba Jo! Gbógun ti àwọn tí ó ń gbógun timi!(Please father! Wage war against those warring against me!)
I’m sure you know what that means. In their white sutanas and turbans, and rosaries in the hands, they’ll call on the Almighty to help them to prosper irrespective of how you choose to run your government.
After four years, you’ll be left with our doses of curses and prayers. We’ll forget the roads you built. The two-room block of classrooms you commissioned, the borehole you drilled with a manual pump. But we’ll never forget how the economy went down and how we battled recession. How the megawatts of electricity never increased. How you canvassed our votes by promising us our rights and how you never did more than wearagbadaand pass bills about increasing your salaries. And yes! We will not forget how you raise your two fingers and shout democracy o!

Signed:

Competence insists on remaining in exile as Buhari begins second term,https://punocracy.com/competence-insists-in-remaining-on-exile-as-buhari-begins-2nd-term/,2019-05-29T15:42:49+01:00,"BEIJING (The T.A. Report)― In a short press release shared with reporters on Wednesday,Competencehas said it has no plans of returning to the Nigerian government offices any time soon ― “at least not within the next four years”.
He complained he has been marginalised by leaders in the country since the return to democracy in 1999, but said he was finally kicked out when Muhammadu Buhari assumed power in 2015.
He has since fled and sought asylum in Beijing, China, after alleged threats to his life.
“I expected so much from him and thought my influence in the government would be strengthened when he took office,” the indignant exile wrote. “But I was disappointed greatly, to say the least.”
“I will not be coming back―at least not within the next four years. Not with that man in office,” he added.
“I did not think Nigeria could survive four years with the appointment of such clueless and incompetent rulers, but clearly I was wrong. Let’s see if they can perform magic again under the new administration.”
Sources at the state house, who we admit were not very sober at the time, told the T.A. Report that someone calledLoyaltyhas occupied the office previously used by Competence since May 2015. There are indications this office will be converted into a full-fledged agency in the coming months.

"Tokunbo cars petition UN, lament ‘cruelty’ in Nigeria",https://punocracy.com/tokunbo-cars-petition-un-lament-cruelty-in-nigeria/,2019-05-26T12:44:21+01:00,"NEW YORK (The T.A. Report)― In a never-before-seen move, foreign-used vehicles in Nigeria, locally known as Tokunbo, have written to the United Nations to complain against what they call “gross abuse and untold cruelty” in the West African country.
“It is the transatlantic slave trade all over again, but this time around the slave masters are in Nigeria,” said the petition, signed by Mr Nissan Micra, president of the Network of Aggrieved Tokunbo Cars (NATC).
NATC is a trade union registered under Nigeria’s National Labour Congress (NLC).
Part of the network’s demands include a well-publicised apology from the Nigerian government, the abolition of cruel practices by car owners, reparations for “freed slaves” and the relatives of the deceased, as well as a temporary ban preventing Nigeria from further importing cars used in developed countries.
The NATC president, in an interview with our reporter, said the petition is a long time coming.
“We are not used to this sort of brutality,” Mr Micra said, in a hoarse but passionate voice. “Compared to our previous owners in USA, Belgium, Germany and so on, car owners in Nigeria have no sympathy at all for their vehicles.
“Not only are the roads in horrible, horrible conditions, inflicting avoidable injuries on us, there is often no insurance for our members in case of accidents.
“The petrol they feed us here is sub-standard and full of lead even though it is allegedly an oil-producing country,” he continued, honking at intervals to show his displeasure.
“There are hardly any qualified automobile doctors here; only charlatans and fraudsters, who profit from our sicknesses. They steal our body organs when no one is looking and give us placebos so that we keep coming to their workshops.”
Mr Volkswagen Jetta, the network’s public relations officer, lamented that it is only in Nigeria you find seven people sitting in a place clearly meant for two.
“One large buttock or two will now be dragging our gearshifts with the driver,” he said. “And, for our minibus-members, those ones called conductors even have one leg in the vehicle and one outside because of lack of space. Let us not even go into how one car is forced to carry loads meant for a lorry.
“You will agree with us that Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world with no retirement policy for cars. We are used and abused till our souls leave our bodies. Even after that, our lifeless contraptions are still enslaved. Without mincing words, we prefer to be euthanised and recycled than to be brought to suffer in this shit-hole country.”
Reacting to the petition, António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, has however said it is unlikely the international organisation will give any consideration to it, “because, for now, cars have not obtained the status of a legal person”. He added that he’s hopeful the world will have its first car-citizen by 2030, taking into account latest advances in Artificial Intelligence.
Recent studies have shown that used cars in Nigeria have less than a third of the average life expectancy rates their age-mates in other countries boast of. Many of them have been found to suffer from depression, lung cancer, and various skin diseases, afflictions that are unknown to their western counterparts.

﻿How to be a Nigerian Scholar in the West│James Yékú,https://punocracy.com/%ef%bb%bfhow-to-be-a-nigerian-scholar-in-the-west-by-james-yeku/,2019-05-23T06:56:06+01:00,"This piece wasfirst published on Mediumby the author on 22 May 2019.
I realized recently that the Nigerian academicoga culture, that punitive style of scholarly mentorship which forbids student thought and agency, has a diaspora version conditioned by the malaise of essentialism. So I decided to present some advice to you, the Nigerian academic who, because of your Western location, routinely dismiss colleagues in the homeland.
In your astute polemical theses, take only one side of an argument and use it as the premise for your sound logic. Simply argue that all Nigerian professors based at home are inept and crude. Never mind that your grouse is with only a few who have counterparts in your region of the world.
Silence anyone on your Facebook timeline that has a different explanation from your hallowed theories. You are the only voice of reason; they, the voice of superstition, and all things inchoate.
Go ahead, mansplain too. How can some woman at home dare challenge your lofty ideas? Remind her you are not her husband. Your ersatz Wole Soyinkasque mind must not be insulted.
You are “in the abroad” and your views must be seen by these irrational colleagues you have left in the dark as the absolute and irrefutable truths. After all, their research is a mere survivalist response to a parlous postcolonial state you are so generous to theorize in your peer-reviewed essays.
Yours is the finest example of scholarship and your prestigious location is the desired Mecca those at home dream only about.
As a matter of fact, avoid any scholarly conversation with a Nigerian professor who is so unfortunate to have never seen an airport before. Why argue with a schmuck? They will call you out for arrogance.
How unfair to rightly diagnose your humble heart. Oga, they are not worth your time. You have 24 hours in a day. They have 42. You need to move on to your next research. The Nobel Prize is calling.
And when next you meet a colleague from home at a conference in Chicago, make sure you keep a safe distance. They may beg to share a hotel room with you or look to you to pay for dinner. Remember, they still think you pick money from the streets of Syracuse.
Are you on the same panel? Great. It’s time again to take that usual mental note about the lack of theoretical rigour in their analyses. Smile and pat your messianic ego on the shoulder. Your next monograph will deliver them from mental blockage.
Forget that there are scholars in your own location who are also mediocre and uninterested in research. Focus only on your African comrades and amplify their in-born mental laziness in your social media posts and on your listserves. To hell with intellectual humility; those guys are the scum of the earth.
When next you visit an archive or library at home, be sure to complain about the kickbacks you were made to pay. Be careful to frame the narrative well: some guy did not see the value of your world-acclaimed research and asked you to give a bribe. Your poor saintly soul had no choice.
And how dare you acknowledge the local knowledge producers you interacted with during your last field trip? Of course, you have to remember they are never experts. Only mere informants who ask for money before presenting any useful data.
The rule of thumb is never to forget too there are no sound thinkers at home. How can there be? They are all consumers of knowledge who depend on your libraries in London.
And don’t ever make the mistake of citing a Nigerian professor who works and teaches in Nigeria. If you do, make sure it is an act of mercy from you, most noble Oga. They will thank you too: their promotion to full professorship depends on it.
If, in your almighty benevolence, you ever decide to co-author a work with a colleague at home, be sure they do the dirty jobs. Thus says Oga from his location in exile! And it shall come to pass in Africa, that forsaken country whose research you are making visible in your pan-African generosity.
If anything goes wrong in the research process, make sure you excoriate the colleague at home. He is too busy with administrative work and services that distract him from the merits of your joint project. Blame him. He is always to be blamed. Your tenure is at stake.
While at all of these, make sure your elitist bubble does not burst. We need you and your Afropolitan mulishness andgra gra.

How to write about Africa│Binyavanga Wainaina,https://punocracy.com/how-to-write-about-africa-by-binyavanga-wainaina/,2019-05-22T12:26:05+01:00,"This piece of satire wasfirst published by Grantaas part of its 40th-Birthday Special. It saddens us greatly that the author, Wainaina, passed away on Tuesday, 21 May 2019. He was a Kenyan author, journalist and 2002 winner of the Caine Prize for African Writing. He authored the book, ‘One Day I will Write About This Place’, and described himself as a “Sometime Satirist”.
Always use the word ‘Africa’ or ‘Darkness’ or ‘Safari’ in your title. Subtitles may include the words ‘Zanzibar’, ‘Masai’, ‘Zulu’, ‘Zambezi’, ‘Congo’, ‘Nile’, ‘Big’, ‘Sky’, ‘Shadow’, ‘Drum’, ‘Sun’ or ‘Bygone’. Also useful are words such as ‘Guerrillas’, ‘Timeless’, ‘Primordial’ and ‘Tribal’. Note that ‘People’ means Africans who are not black, while ‘The People’ means black Africans.
Never have a picture of a well-adjusted African on the cover of your book, or in it, unless that African has won the Nobel Prize. An AK-47, prominent ribs, naked breasts: use these. If you must include an African, make sure you get one in Masai or Zulu or Dogon dress.
In your text, treat Africa as if it were one country. It is hot and dusty with rolling grasslands and huge herds of animals and tall, thin people who are starving. Or it is hot and steamy with very short people who eat primates. Don’t get bogged down with precise descriptions. Africa is big: fifty-four countries, 900 million people who are too busy starving and dying and warring and emigrating to read your book.
The continent is full of deserts, jungles, highlands, savannahs and many other things, but your reader doesn’t care about all that, so keep your descriptions romantic and evocative and unparticular.
Make sure you show how Africans have music and rhythm deep in their souls, and eat things no other humans eat. Do not mention rice and beef and wheat; monkey-brain is an African’s cuisine of choice, along with goat, snake, worms and grubs and all manner of game meat. Make sure you show that you are able to eat such food without flinching, and describe how you learn to enjoy it—because you care.
Taboo subjects: ordinary domestic scenes, love between Africans (unless a death is involved), references to African writers or intellectuals, mention of school-going children who are not suffering from yaws or Ebola fever or female genital mutilation.
Throughout the book, adopt asottovoice, in conspiracy with the reader, and a sadI-expected-so-muchtone. Establish early on that your liberalism is impeccable, and mention near the beginning how much you love Africa, how you fell in love with the place and can’t live without her. Africa is the only continent you can love—take advantage of this.
If you are a man, thrust yourself into her warm virgin forests. If you are a woman, treat Africa as a man who wears a bush jacket and disappears off into the sunset. Africa is to be pitied, worshipped or dominated. Whichever angle you take, be sure to leave the strong impression that without your intervention and your important book, Africa is doomed.
Your African characters may include naked warriors, loyal servants, diviners and seers, ancient wise men living in hermitic splendour. Or corrupt politicians, inept polygamous travel-guides, and prostitutes you have slept with. The Loyal Servant always behaves like a seven-year-old and needs a firm hand; he is scared of snakes, good with children, and always involving you in his complex domestic dramas. The Ancient Wise Man always comes from a noble tribe (not the money-grubbing tribes like the Gikuyu, the Igbo or the Shona). He has rheumy eyes and is close to the Earth.
The Modern African is a fat man who steals and works in the visa office, refusing to give work permits to qualified Westerners who really care about Africa. He is an enemy of development, always using his government job to make it difficult for pragmatic and good-hearted expats to set up NGOs or Legal Conservation Areas. Or he is an Oxford-educated intellectual turned serial-killing politician in a Savile Row suit. He is a cannibal who likes Cristal champagne, and his mother is a rich witch-doctor who really runs the country.
Among your characters you must always include The Starving African, who wanders the refugee camp nearly naked, and waits for the benevolence of the West. Her children have flies on their eyelids and pot bellies, and her breasts are flat and empty. She must look utterly helpless. She can have no past, no history; such diversions ruin the dramatic moment. Moans are good. She must never say anything about herself in the dialogue except to speak of her (unspeakable) suffering.
Also be sure to include a warm and motherly woman who has a rolling laugh and who is concerned for your well-being. Just call her Mama. Her children are all delinquent. These characters should buzz around your main hero, making him look good. Your hero can teach them, bathe them, feed them; he carries lots of babies and has seen Death. Your hero is you (if reportage), or a beautiful, tragic international celebrity/aristocrat who now cares for animals (if fiction).
Bad Western characters may include children of Tory cabinet ministers, Afrikaners, employees of the World Bank. When talking about exploitation by foreigners mention the Chinese and Indian traders. Blame the West for Africa’s situation. But do not be too specific.
Broad brushstrokes throughout are good. Avoid having the African characters laugh, or struggle to educate their kids, or just make do in mundane circumstances. Have them illuminate something about Europe or America in Africa. African characters should be colourful, exotic, larger than life—but empty inside, with no dialogue, no conflicts or resolutions in their stories, no depth or quirks to confuse the cause.
Describe, in detail, naked breasts (young, old, conservative, recently raped, big, small) or mutilated genitals, or enhanced genitals. Or any kind of genitals. And dead bodies. Or, better, naked dead bodies. And especially rotting naked dead bodies. Remember, any work you submit in which people look filthy and miserable will be referred to as the ‘real Africa’, and you want that on your dust jacket. Do not feel queasy about this: you are trying to help them to get aid from the West. The biggest taboo in writing about Africa is to describe or show dead or suffering white people.
Animals, on the other hand, must be treated as well rounded, complex characters. They speak (or grunt while tossing their manes proudly) and have names, ambitions and desires. They also have family values:see how lions teach their children?Elephants are caring, and are good feminists or dignified patriarchs. So are gorillas.
Never, ever say anything negative about an elephant or a gorilla. Elephants may attack people’s property, destroy their crops, and even kill them. Always take the side of the elephant. Big cats have public-school accents. Hyenas are fair game and have vaguely Middle Eastern accents. Any short Africans who live in the jungle or desert may be portrayed with good humour (unless they are in conflict with an elephant or chimpanzee or gorilla, in which case they are pure evil).
After celebrity activists and aid workers, conservationists are Africa’s most important people. Do not offend them. You need them to invite you to their 30,000-acre game ranch or ‘conservation area’, and this is the only way you will get to interview the celebrity activist. Often a book cover with a heroic-looking conservationist on it works magic for sales. Anybody white, tanned and wearing khaki who once had a pet antelope or a farm is a conservationist, one who is preserving Africa’s rich heritage. When interviewing him or her, do not ask how much funding they have; do not ask how much money they make off their game. Never ask how much they pay their employees.
Readers will be put off if you don’t mention the light in Africa. And sunsets, the African sunset is a must. It is always big and red. There is always a big sky. Wide empty spaces and game are critical—Africa is the Land of Wide Empty Spaces. When writing about the plight of flora and fauna, make sure you mention that Africa is overpopulated. When your main character is in a desert or jungle living with indigenous peoples (anybody short) it is okay to mention that Africa has been severely depopulated by Aids and War (use caps).
You’ll also need a nightclub called Tropicana, where mercenaries, evil nouveau riche Africans and prostitutes and guerrillas and expats hang out.
Always end your book with Nelson Mandela saying something about rainbows or renaissances. Because you care.

Behind the scenes: Buhari’s prayers in Medina,https://punocracy.com/behind-the-news-buharis-prayers-in-medina/,2019-05-18T10:47:08+01:00,"Nigeria’s President, Muhammadu Buhari, Friday, arrived in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, from the city of Madinah, where he began the initial leg of his Umrah engagements in the Kingdom.
Mr Buhari left Nigeria for Saudi Arabia on Thursday to perform the Umrah (lesser Hajj), on the invitation of King Salman of Saudi Arabia.
After arriving Madinah Thursday, Mr Buhari performed the evening prayer at the Holy Prophet’s Mosque.
According to his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, in an email to PREMIUM TIMES Saturday, the president was ushered to the grave of Prophet Mohammed where he said prayers for “the nation, his family and himself.”
Mr Shehu said Mr Buhari was seen off at the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Madina International Airport by the Governor of the Madinah Province, Faisal Al-Saud.

Somewhere in the Arabian desert, two frames dressed in white ihram, one bald-headed and much taller than the second, are seen discussing in hushed tones and with a seriousness characteristic of Nigeria, one of the world’s very advanced nations.The Sun provides a natural filter for the faces of His Excellency, the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and his most senior media adviser… but Bayo Omoboriowo, the president’s photographer, is not close-by to capture the unique scene.
Shehu:Mr President, Nigerians are waiting to hear what you have achieved from the umrah. I can sense the impatience, sir. You know the opposition is already asking why the president has chosen to go on an optional pilgrimage only weeks after a ten-day private visit to the UK.
Bubu:Don’t you worry, mallam. Don’t worry. We won’t leave here empty-handed, I can assure you. We’ll find some documents to sign with the Saudi King. Please remind me to tell Ambassador Dodo to draft a loan agreement before nightfall.
Shehu:That’s good, Mr President. What will the loan be used for?
Bubu:I’m still thinking… but the idea of having our first government-owned pencil factories, and exporting to countries like Japan or Canada where there are almost no out-of-school children has been on my mind for sometime.
Shehu:Maa shaa Allah! That is brilliant, Mr President. We will have the factories in all six geopolitical zones, and mandate all MDAs and public schools to use only homegrown writing materials. Our revenue will triple at least.
Bubu:(grins)Yoowa!
Shehu:Ahem.But in the mean time, Mr President, we need to send something to the press before they start asking questions or insinuate you’ve been admitted at some hospital.
Bubu:Hmmm… that is true. Okay, tell them I went to the prophet’s grave to supplicate to the almighty.
Shehu:(begins to scribble on a small journal) Oh great. What did you pray for, Mr President?
Bubu:Many things. Can’t remember it all. But most importantly I prayed to win the presidential election in 2023…
Shehu:(cuts in) 2023 sir?
Bubu:Of course. Don’t you know that to clean up the mess of the PDP, we need at least 16 years in power with the same amount of resources? …and I have not seen anyone, with enough integrity, who can take over from me yet. Or mallam, do you have someone in mind?
Shehu:Ah, not at all, Mr President.
Bubu:Yes, yes. But really, I also want to see the look on OBJ’s face when I become the first Nigerian president to serve three terms in office.
Shehu:(smirks and giggles lightly).
Bubu:I also prayed for good health and long life, so I can retire to my farm in Daura after several years of serving the country. I prayed to Allah to make our youth hard-working. He should give them jobs so they won’t have time foryahoo yahooand to be complaining about everything… I also asked for more oil.Wallahi, we need more oil in the country, especially in the North. If we are making the states more independent, we need to discover crude oil reserves fast the other regions. And,na’am, I prayed for Aisha. Ah! That woman does not listen. She does not know her place. It is not everything you talk about in public. I just hope Allah answers my prayer and make her pay more attention to the family than the media.
Shehu:Hmm… Noted, Mr President.
Bubu:The security problem in Nigeria… ah, I must not forget that one. For at least twenty minutes, I prayed fervently about all these herdsmen, Boko Haram crises disturbing my government in some of these states. Now, kidnappers have joined them. Only God can restore peace to the country now,wallahi. I’ve done my best. I’m sure with our fasting and prayer in this holy month, we’ll start noticing some changes. Make sure you tell Nigerians their president is praying for peace, mallam.
Shehu:Ermmm…
… Two hours later, one hears the clicking sounds of keys as someone writes an email on a very expensive laptop—adjusted for (contract) inflation.
“Dear Premium Times,
… We are pleased to have you know that the president has just returned from the holy grounds where lies the grave of the prophet of Islam; and there he said prayers for the nation, his family, and himself.”
Yours faithfully,
Garba Shehu,
Senior Adviser on Media to the President.

Letter to the Nigerian people. Signed: Your Politician,https://punocracy.com/letter-to-the-nigerian-people-signed-your-politician/,2019-05-17T07:35:41+01:00,"By:Hamzat Mariam
Dear Nigerians,
It is with frustration I write you this letter. I am tired! Of everything Nigerian and everyone. I’m tired of been labelled corrupt when all I have done is help people in my own way.
Ever since I joined this game called politics, I have come to realise it is no fault of politicians in any way that things are the way they are. Rather than blame us, Nigerians should praise us. Yes.
I am a politician, and even currently a minister. But what Nigerians have forgotten is that I’m also a father and a husband. I am but a servant of the people with personal responsibilities. I earn a salary and I have allowances too, but have you forgotten that I have responsibilities?
Like any parent, I want the best for my kids. They have to go to the best schools abroad if they are to be able to mingle freely with the sons and daughters of other ministers and governors. If they are to be given out in marriage, as political tool in exchange for positions, then it is only best that I give them what they want.
Even my wife has standards to meet up too. For the sake of her friends, appearance and even Nigerians who gossip.
More than being a minister, I have duties to fulfil first to my family and relatives and myself. They all look up to me for jobs, money, position, and all that comes with my influential post. It is also pertinent that I help them if I’m to live a good life full of love and admiration. I place my family on a pedestal, even more than a position I signed up for willingly.
Do you now see that it is no fault of mine if I accept brown envelopes and engage in dubious businesses when my earnings do not pay for all my needs?
Just the other day while on a visit to my mother’s, I gave the youths filling up the potholes on the road an handsome cash of N5000. What if the contractor had done the road excellently with expensive materials, how will these youths make money from the hundreds of cars on that route? I’m sure they are making a lot!
Even many Nigerian youth now believe in entrepreneurship and no longer wait for government jobs. If there had been jobs, would they think of establishing or starting something of their own? Scarcity and inflation, I dare say, have increased local production.
With the low standard of education and lack of teachers in public schools, a lot of parent are opting for private schools where they give their kids the best at a high cost. Is it not a win- win situation unhindered by the government? The school makes money and the kids get the best.
‘Corrupt’ is a word that seems to flow effortlessly with ‘Nigerian politician’ on many a Nigerian’s tongue. But rather than blame us or insult us, I plead that you use our idleness and corruption to your advantage. Although we do it glutinously for ourselves, it is for your benefit too.
Rather than blame us politicians, Nigerians really have enough to be thankful for. Every sector can be improved with a thinking and working Nigerian.

Yours in service,
An ethical Nigerian politician.

In 2011, Sergei Mavrodi,
the most honourable man of Russia, launched MMM Global. Unfortunately, he could
not run it on the soil of his land — his home country’s government was informed
and conscious of her people’s welfare enough not to yield to his schemes. Therefore,
he was left with no choice but shipping it abroad.
Although the business
model was not new, it was one of the first of its kind in recent times — at
least according to official records.
Eventually, shipping it
abroad he did. The business went on to become wildly popular especially in most
African countries. Of course, our dear country, Nigeria, was one of them.
Promoting itself as “a mutual aid fund where ordinary people help each other,”
MMM Global officially started its Nigerian operations in November 2015 and by
2016, more than 2 million of our countrymen had registered. By January 2017, however,
MMM was already struggling to breathe. Eventually, it died.
So, what led to the demise
of MMM? The answer is in finance. MMM was a Ponzi scheme. And Ponzi schemes
operate on a system that fuses outrageous monetary promises and pyramid-style
investing.
In brief, the Ponzi
scheme, together with its kin, the pyramid scheme, is a fraud. It seeks to generate
no value to its subscribers. Hence, it is not investing in the real sense of
the term. When you “invest” in Ponzi schemes, your money is not used to do
anything. Instead, it is paid to another investor. It goes on and on like that.
And that is exactly why Ponzi schemes always bottom out when there are no new
investors to pay.That, usually, often
marks their doom.
LeaveLoomnot, Agents. Borrow nothing from events of the past. Yes, I agree, to some extent, your falling prey to obscure investment schemes is not your fault. “Poor souls are desperate souls.” Isn’t that what we hear? “Unemployed men are ever eager.” Isn’t that what we know? Add to those the fact that your government does not care about you for all it cares. At ordinary oversight and regulatory roles itmiserably fails.
So, keep looming, agents
ofLoom. And trust me,no one will run mad in any of your rooms.
For Loom will continue to bloom — at least until it gets to
its doom."
"Weight loss now requirement for promotion of civil servants, says FG",https://punocracy.com/weight-loss-now-requirement-for-promotion-of-civil-servants-says-fg/,2019-05-08T00:21:04+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― To move from one grade level to the next, Nigerian civil servants will now have to provide proof of weight loss among other documents, according to a new circular.
The circular, with reference number, HCSF/911/KG/P/1, was released on Tuesday and signed by Mrs. Winifred E. Oyo-Ita, the country’s Head of Civil Service.
It cited scientific studies conducted by the ministry of health as basis for the  new provision and said employees of the federal government who are unable to meet up may face severe consequences.
“Research commissioned by the government has shown there is a direct correlation between weight loss and productivity, and the former is in fact the most reliable measure of the latter,” the document stated.
“Henceforth,” it added, “it is therefore compulsory, in the overall interest of the country, for civil servants to submit evidence of significant weight loss alongside other credentials as prerequisite for consideration for promotion.”
“Workers who are found wanting and are unable to establish hard work through body weight loss will be withdrawn from service after five years of such default.”
The circular further stated that new civil servants will be required to declare their body weight, using test results obtained from public health centres, while filling assets declaration forms.
“This is to keep track of how much dedication they put into their work from year to year,” it explained.
Workers, sources at the ministry of labour and employment told our reporter, may also soon be compelled to submit documents showing how many days off work they spent overseas as well as church/mosque attendance registers.
“The administration wants to make sure civil servants are taking time out to freshen up and to pray for the country,” an aide to the minister disclosed. “You see, especially now that the minimum wage has been increased, it is important we get value for every penny spent.”
This development is coming shortly after President Muhammadu Buhari praised the Inspector-General of Police for how he has tackled the insecurity in the country, as obvious from his loss of weight.
“I have just seen the IGP, he is losing weight so I think he is working hard,” the president, who had just returned from a 10-day private trip to the UK,saidto NTA. His wide grin seemed to suggest he could not understand what everybody was complaining so much about.
Reports reaching the T.A. Report indicate that gyms across the country are witnessing an unprecedented surge in active members since the new circular affecting civil servants was made public.

Caveat: Note that this piece is a fictional satire aimed purely at humour. The words above are nothing but products of a drunk writer’s imagination. We hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the results of anyone’s credulity or mischief. Do not take us serious. We repeat; do not take us serious! … On second thought though, maybe you should do just that."
Is Falz Nigeria’s first satirical artiste? — Reviewing Nigeria’s ‘immoralities’ through his Moral Instructions,https://punocracy.com/is-falz-our-very-first-satirical-artiste/,2019-05-06T15:17:49+01:00,"“Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.” — Plato.
Plato was a philosopher who
lived in the ancient Greek city of Athens. Then, Athens still had a hegemonic
control on other cities, a control it had to fight successive wars to keep.
Hence, it was a time of great
political upheavals, and Plato, having seen the city come close to ruin many times,
decided to devise an alternative political system to save it.
He considered a “regulated, wise, courageous, and just” city as the ideal city. Interestingly, since he firmly believed that music had a powerful influence on the soul, he thought good music — music that makes the soul good — could help tremendously in establishing it. If mere music could do wonders, how much more can satirical music do?
Fast forward to hundreds
of years after Plato, we can find a state in a situation similar to that of
Athens. It is the Nigerian state, a state that is at war every day. Not with
outsiders but with itself — its myriad of pressingly undeniable social ills.
In a bid by some unrelenting quarters to establish the ideal Nigerian state, Falz has assumed the musical role Plato had envisaged — even more to the extent of comfortably using satire to drive home his points. From Sweet Nigeria in which he sang This is Nigeria to his latest, Moral Instruction, he has shown he is serious about the role.
In the album’s Johnny, he rebukes
the reckless killing of innocent youth in the hands of supposed law-enforcement
agencies. He successfully paints the pictures of uniformed individuals who are
meant to keep us safe but, to paraphrase his lines, “make bright youngsters drop for no just cause.”
“No break, no gear, no job, no sense”is the most catchy line of Follow
Follow whereby he discusses a prevailing mentality among Nigerians. It is the
mentality to be negatively influenced by the lavish spending of the wealthy
class, to thrive on the vanity of the media, and to do beyond themselves.
Arguably the most scathing track,Amenfaces the religious quandary headlong. In a satirical tone, he brilliantly touches upon the enslaving nature of the national religious situation. Religious stewards pull up in Rolls-Royce Ghost, pray in the Name of the Lord, and threaten their subjects with“slowed blessing”if they do not pay tithe, raking in millions in the process.
The crooner likens
religion to a drug that can make its users, “people wey he dey fight for turn around against him.”Overall, his
grouch can be perfectly surmised in the string of lines:
Church plenty pass school for inside my estate
You sell hope
You sell faith
You sell dreams to get paid
Na congregation money
But dem no go see percentage
The stewards preach being each other’s brother’s keeper. By using offering to set up universities that their members cannot afford, they become the paragon of the virtue they preach, don’t they?
Also, Falz alludes to the
fact that Nigerians are the perfect religionists in the world. Why won’t we be
in the face of our selflessness and propriety? In Brother’s Keeper, he shows
how we have been able to imbibe a rare spirit of camaraderie thoroughly, how we
are truly our brother’s keepers!
Every time a well-fed
Nigerian does not care about one Seyi, his neighbour who struggles to eat, he
demonstrates this spirit. Because of it, Servants of God are too sanctified to
break any law. No Nigerian can steal; we are allborn again.The traffic is bad, the red light comes on, but a
Nigeriancarry tanker enter road?He
is being his brother’s keeper to his core.
When Nigerian governors do
not pay civil servants’ salaries for years but add new benz to their convoys
every year,they are being prudent.And
when any of our statesmenuses taxpayer
money to dey flex, to go buy jet, they are being kind.
When pharmacists sell fake
drugs just to make quick bucks,they are keeping
their brothers’ — their fellow Nigerians’ — back. Falz’s list of effective
brother-keeping roles cuts across diverse professions and does not mind whose
eyes are gouged.
Perhaps, the most
satirical track of this mouthwatering album isHypocrite.In it, Falz does not just hit the nail on the head; he
hits it on the sides, too. Nigerians are not hypocrites; they are far from
being.
“Everybody is a motherfucking hypocrite oh,” he hammers. As a Nigerian, you can be religious and wicked. It is a great combo. A corrupt Christian bloke? Don’t be surprised. A stealing Muslim man? That is great. We identify human rights, but homosexuality is evil? That’s Nigerian.
You are a gentleman at work and with your buds, but you go
home and beat your wife? You are the best.  You are Nigerian. Our pastors never sin! (How
can they ever?) Politicians, most especially during electioneering processes,
do like they really care about the masses? It is fine. All these, among others,
are normal elements of the Nigerian culture, and there is nothing hypocritical
about them!
In Moral Instruction, Falz does not make a noise. Instead, he sings the version of music Plato encouraged — the good type of music. Through it, he teaches the rapidly morally sinking Nigerians some essential truths. His engagement of satire to do so is brilliant; the truths he airs are crucial: we badly need them. Nigerians do not appear to have an awareness of those truths. And for people to be good, they first have to know the truths — better still if they come in a satirical form.
In those songs, Amen,
Brother’s Keeper and Hypocrite especially, the artiste puts himself in the
shoes of those he condemns. He satirises them. All through, to ensure effective
delivery, he assumes the persona of the pastor, of the doctor, the politician, the
business tycoon, of even the ordinary Nigerian, and then speaks from their
perspectives. At first, he may seem to be merely echoing their thoughts. However,
the discerning mind would realise he is instead satirically condemning their
acts.
Falz has successfully made
the Fela-like image he has carved for himself his safe enclave. For now, he too
seems to be enjoying it. Like the dead musician cum political dissident, he appears
to be genuinely committed to goading the ruling class into positive actions. Indeed,
he has always talked against Nigerian social ills using his scathing lyrics.
However, with Moral Instruction, he does with a more compelling force. He reviews the immoralities in the Nigerian clime. Also, this time, in those pulsating rhythms, in Johnny specifically, he presents us with a question that urgently demands an answer from all of us:if Johnny continues to drop, eeyan melo lo maku (how many people will be left)?"
Opinion: Laugh if you like. But we need satire more than ever│Owen Jones,https://punocracy.com/laugh-if-you-like-but-we-need-satire-more-than-ever/,2019-05-05T09:06:49+01:00,"English newspaper columnist and political commentator,Owen Jones, shares his thoughts on the political significance of satire in this op-ed,first published by The Guardianin December, 2014.
There’s nothing the establishment hates more than ridicule – that’s why it’s vital for a healthy democracy
The world of social media is a swirling, sometimes dizzying mess of contradictions. A powerful force for mobilising political change, or sometimes a glorified mass of torches and pitchforks; a means to instantly engage and debate with people of all leanings and all continents, or a means to obsessively harass, troll and threaten strangers; a tool to broaden horizons, or to be bombarded with nonsensical junk. But our social media, increasingly, are assuming a role that is crucial in a democracy: satirising and ridiculing the powerful.
Political satire is booming online, where taking the mighty and the powerful down a peg or two is a sport. On the web you can find Vine videos of George Osborne looking spaced out at prime minister’s questions; and the mocking of broken political promises, from “We’re all in it together” to the trebling of tuition fees. Some of it is crude, unpolished or just not very funny. But thank goodness social media have taken up the mantle – because there is all too little of it on our TV screens.
Satire is so subversive – and often politically fatal for those who rule – because it exposes the absurdities of power. Authority attempts to assert itself partly through a veneer of respectability and seriousness. When that is stripped away, its legitimacy can be lost, along with our subservience. But asJeremy Paxman asked a few months ago, “Where is the Spitting Image of today? … Imagine the sport the show could have with Cameron and Clegg. But I don’t care whether it’s puppets or cartoons or real people.Just give us some decent satire.”
The humorous ridiculing of the powerful has a proud pedigree in Britain. Back in the mid-19th century, it was Punch magazine that championed satire, being sympathetic to the rising demands of democracy against the country’s oligarchic, unaccountable elite. More recently, satire has episodically flourished on our TV screens: That Was The Week That Was audaciously challenged the stultifying deference of the early 60s; Not the Nine O’Clock News stuck it to the political elite as Thatcherism dawned; more recently, we had Bremner, Bird and Fortune.
Yes, we have the likes of Have I Got News For You; and The Thick Of It is a modern classic, even if it doesn’t skewer actual living politicians. But nothing has the bite and reach of Spitting Image. In its 12-year run, it reached up to 15 million people each week. Margaret Thatcher was a hectoring alpha male bullying her pathetically cowardly cabinet; Labour was a shambolic, incompetent mess; and even the royal family got a kicking, once shown moving to a council estate because they couldn’t afford the poll tax.
Look at the US, by contrast. Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show reaches a disproportionately young audience,entertaining and informing them. Stephen Colbert takes on the US’s ranting rightwing shock jocks. Depressingly, we’re even exporting satirical talent such as Birmingham-born John Oliver, who presents Last Week Tonight on HBO.
There is a counter-argument too: for if there’s one thing we don’t lack in modern Britain, it’s cynicism about our political elite. Our politicians have never been loved, and now they are even less popular than most tropical diseases. But that’s not altogether healthy.
Anger at our political elite seldom fuels action to do anything about it, engendering instead an enraged passivity: people scream at the television set rather than taking to the streets. That actually suits the political elite rather well, because it makes them less accountable. It also undermines those of us who want radical change: if you believe all politicians are liars and charlatans, then you are less likely to see politics as a realistic vehicle to transform society.
But quality satire does not just scrutinise and ridicule the great and the good. It helps engage those who otherwise find politics tedious. Politics can be made fun, raucous and appealing (at least for those not on the receiving end of it). Maybe – as the likes ofRory Bremner suggest– politics has become stuffed with so many dreary on-message types that there’s too little comedy fodder. But while Ed Miliband is routinely mocked by many newspapers, Nigel Farage and David Cameron have largely escaped such treatment in most of the press.
It is all too often those at the bottom of society who are demonised and derided. There’s too little punching up. Where is the scrutinising – and yes, ridiculing – of the poverty-paying bosses, the tax dodgers, or the bankers responsible for economic disaster? Satire can be brilliantly effective at encouraging us to challenge the way our society is run. It is a more crucial element of our democracy than we perhaps think, and we should fight to bring it back to the prime-time slots it deserves."
Review: A journey into Nigeria through Elnathan John’s Guide on Be(com)ing Nigerian,https://punocracy.com/review-a-journey-into-nigeria-through-elnathan-johns-guide-on-becoming-nigerian/,2019-05-05T06:50:03+01:00,"Place a mirror in front of Nigeria, and all that you would see is Be(com)ing Nigerian:A Guide. The book passes to be called Nigeria’s encyclopedia on what Nigerians do daily, all year long.
Elnathan John’s blockbuster book, published by Cassava Republic, carries the fetal DNA of Nigerianness. Reading it brings forth the fetal delivery of the elephant in the room: Nigeria.
Of course, the Germany-based satirist could have chosen to tell his story in a different genre from satire, owing to how much Nigerians appreciate – or put bluntly, “understand” – satire, but his choice of this genre shows the belief he has in satire, and how it can be used to demand change in a value-deprived society.
Also, born in Kaduna though, being one of those one might call Nigerians in diaspora, the author flaunts his full knowledge of the Nigerian people. He speaks the Nigerian lingo in the book. On occasions where a Nigerian (orNaija) diction is all that is needed to nail a point, he never runs out of supply for it. He hits the hammer right inside that hole at once.
He even reminds reader of such diction as“At all at-all nah im bad pass”(meaning something is better than nothing). He ends the book with a brief glossary of corrupted English words like:Aksfor ask;moqsefor mosque.
Be(com)ing Nigerian is told in a relaxed but ironic tone. But the author’s points were spot on and sincere too. John recognises the can-do spirit of average Nigerians. But that is not his focus.
His grouse is etched on the Nigerian ideology of hustle, a term that describes the urge to get ahead by any means necessary. John believes this has supplanted a sound unifying value system in the country.
Hence, he spares no one of his rod of ridicule nor does he shy away from shaming those that should be shamed — politicians, religious leaders, NGOs, artisans, journalists and even writers.
He bites hard at everyone. One would also note the fury underneath some of the author’s expressions; he does well by keeping this at bay, nonetheless. There are times he went the subtle way; however, when need be, he aimed the right punch weight at the right spot. Asides being spot on, John’s ridicules are also current.
One of his chapter talks about becoming a policeman. “Accidental discharge” which John clarifies not to be an unplanned ejaculation during a sexual romp but the erroneous release of bullets on citizens by trigger-happy policemen. Like the daily sun, cases like this are recurrent in Nigeria.
Looking at the book’s splash of black and yellow cover page, wallpapered by a caricatured policeman with a ballooned belly, John tells more story about the Nigerian police with that alone.
Asides hustle, the Nigerian God is one phenomenon John harps on. With the term “Nigerian God”, John establishes how Nigerians have redefined their concept of God. A classic point he makes is Nigerians’ warfare prayers characterised by loudness with absolute disregard for the next door neighbour.
Under the guise of the belief in the Nigerian God, John shows, Nigerians swindle one another, and also accept fate when things go wrong and they could have taken action. It is the Nigerian God religious leaders profess during their escapades with their political buddies. He is who they attribute why they must live luxurious lives to, John writes.
Politricking, as John titles another chapter in his book, unearths the traits of Nigerian politicians. He taunts them as those from whose eyes shame has been peeled off. The author puts it thus:“Do you sometimes feel shame when you are caught doing something wrong? If the answer is yes, then you are not ready for Nigerian politics.”
The 36-year-old excoriates journalists, too: those whose job is to sniff around for “brown envelope” like ants would for sugar, and report first before thinking of fact-checking. An author himself, John gives authors their own chunk of the pie by latching at those who suffer obsession for drinking and trade content for mediocrity.
The author highlights daily oddities in the Nigerian society. In doing this, the “recovering lawyer” burrows his satirical pins into the skin of those who brandish their business cards at any little chance, those who arrive meetings late, those who are visa-sick, and so on. John’s latches at these categories of people are merciless.
John’s delivery is sublime. Humour – a key ingredient in satirical pieces – dots virtually all pages of the book; but he never for once gifted away inciting thoughtfulness in readers. His descriptions are finely tuned and toned, too.
His occasional use of metaphor are well cut out. For instance, in saying “useless”, he puts it as“an impotent given a condom”. Or another where he says nothing pains more than erectile dysfunction. John simply knows where to dangle the metaphoric bait to make you either smile or reflect – but mostly both.
Were he to have included a chapter that tells us how Nigerians live in denial when it comes sexual recklessness, he might have tightened some missing nuts in the book. Add this to the fact that the author did not hurl jibes the way of the Nigerian military personnel like he did the police, one could say this is yet another underbelly in the book.
The author makes up for these, however, by serving readers with rich content and tongue-in-cheek imageries. They are never out of sight for once in the book.
For Nigerians, the book reawakens their consciousness into what they do. For non-Nigerians, it beams light into understanding the inner workings of Nigeria and its people. Be(com)ing Nigerian speaks truth to power without fear or favour. And for anyone who savours this trait in a book, Elnathan John’s book satisfies thatspecification."
Ashewo: a guide to using the tag right in Nigeria.,https://punocracy.com/ashewo-a-guide-to-using-the-tag-right-in-nigeria/,2019-05-03T10:50:27+01:00,"If you’re a man with a penis, and you know how to use it on a woman (or you intend to use it someday), be it by sending unsolicited dick picture on the Internet to apparently more successful women (to bow to your eminence), or by just throwing it around in public places in the name of urinating, or by using your super strength to pin women down (especially strangers or stubborn wives and relatives) and penetrate them without consent, then you should stop reading this.
God has given you the wisdom, knowledge, and understanding to know your place in society, you belong to the top of the food chain and you’re never afraid to take what belongs to you.
It is those ones who call themselves Liberal men, those stubborn women who call themselves feminists, and those men who lack the spine to insult women and want to treat them as equals that God has sent me to. Those ones need to be reminded why Women are forever tagged Ashewo.
We (Nigerians) are an advanced society of religious people. An index (whatever index means) has recently shown that Nigerians top the list of most religious and prayerful people on earth. With over 200m worshippers of Allah and Jesus, we easily beat worshippers from other countries. We are God’s own. That is why it is important that we remind our men that God has given them the power to Lord over women and they must use that power in the glorification of God.
The Bible said in Ephesians 5:22-23; “Wives, be SUBJECT to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.”
If she is a woman and she’s not subject to her husband, or under her father’s protection (at all times including at work), then she is an ashewo by default. If you call her colleague or mate (especially if she has annoyed you), then you’re committing a sin. That ashewo was born to be subject to you.
Women can’t be above men in any work setting whatsoever. A woman above you must’ve definitely slept with people in the office. Note I said people, because no single man can elevate a woman above other men. It has to be a lot of weak spined men. Even if he were an entry level worker, a man should always be above women. Otherwise, she’s an ashawo.
Which Alhaji bought the car for her? Who is paying her house rent? Why does she wear suit and other office apparels in the morning and come back late at night; looking exhausted. Is it a young millionaire? A UK based sponsor? A pastor? A woman can’t simply own a house or car on her own. It’s not written. It can’t happen. When she does, dear men, please call her ashewo unprovoked.
Tell your little children not to be like Aunty Sandra who lies that she works in a Bank but you never see her when you visit her branch. Tell them that she is a lying ashewo because she mentioned one day that she’s the manager of that branch and that’s why you never see her. How can a woman head anything? Isn’t head a position for people with penis alone? Sandra is an ashewo.
When we say “all my guys are ballers”, we mean the guys in every literally masculine sense of it. The male gender is endangered by lazy women who need to depend on us for existence and we have the difficult task of handling every situation; including balling. Therefore, a woman is not expected to ball on her own. Even if she’s with a man whom she claims to be her lover (they call Alhajis lovers too), she is an ashewo. Any woman who is found balling on her own is also an ashewo.
Balling is a thing for guys, and when a woman decides she wants to ball too, then she’s an ashewo.
We don’t have offices for “men leaders” on purpose. A man is expected to lead, and when he does so, he leads other men and the women. But a woman is expected to lead only women. That’s why we’ve in the goodness of our hearts created lots of women leader offices across country so that women can lead other women.
While some women have ashawo-ed their way into top offices, the peak offices like Governor (Mama Taraba, sorry o), President, and whatever is in that league is for Men alone. If and when we create a female National Assembly, they can have their own Senate President and Speaker, without fear of being removed by better men (men are always better).
They said some women were arrested days ago in Abuja and people have been carrying digital placards. So what? Those Police officers were men doing what men were made to do; dominating, and there’s nothing you can do about it weaker vessels. Take your beating in peace. Next time you’ll call an Alhaji immediately and cry like mad instead of saying you’ll bail yourself out. Who cares if you were just balling (remember this is a sin for women sef) or working at night. You’re a woman and you must comply.

Women, you see, are very fragile creatures. They need to be protected and covered. They don’t know left from right. All they do is eat, and wash clothes, and cook, and do dishes, and iron, and complain about period, and make babies, and raise babies, all from money provided by men who work very hard to make it happen. We are supposed to be the provider, just let us do our thing. We are meant to be the protector, don’t take it from us. We are the voice of reason, don’t challenge us by being smart. These things are really simple and it’d be a better world if women would just know their place.
Knowing your place isn’t that hard is it? Any little out of place behaviour, and you’re nothing than an ashewo. Kajiko? Men, if she says you’re right at all times, allows you assert dominance, doesn’t complain (even when you beat her), and can endure long periods of torture (especially this one) for her kids (even if she doesn’t have any yet), then we may call her Iyawo or wife material instead of ashewo. But only for as long as she behaves. She misbehaves? Ashewo.

This is what it means to be Nigerian.,https://punocracy.com/this-is-what-it-means-to-be-nigerian/,2019-04-28T10:52:16+01:00,"The first commandment is to know grief;

To be Nigerian, you’ve to learn to let God lead; he is the alpha and omega,
the love of God supercedes the love of state.
he is why your business fails; to protect you from more harm. (it is not government’s policies)
he is why your child dies; to save you from raising a murderer. (it is not non-functioning hospitals)
he is why your car breaks down on the highway; to save you from robbers…
but
you and Mr. Jackson, who drove into a battalion of waiting thieves (it is God who saves you remember)…
belong to the same church.
God… is merciful.
In Nigeria, you’re an artist of race.
first you paint yourself as a Yorùbá,
then as a Yorùbá Christian.
and Chukwu thinks you all are jokers, because Catholicism is the light,
and Abdul cuts off Fuhad, for not knowing Allah enough.
in Nigeria, you paint yourself different, and then you suck the nectar out of yourselves.

A Nigerian, is never at fault.
it is the President who is responsible for the dumpsite in the middle of the road,
and the House built on a waterway,
and the building which collapses,
and the tanker which explodes;
you’re not to blame, for lifting a bucket and digging into oil, as it runs through the road from an accidental abortion of a fuel delivery…
the sky is thick with smoke,
of the sins of your leaders,
of the errors of their ways,
of the policies they didn’t make,
of the road they didn’t fix,
but because you’re a Nigerian, you are guilt free.

This is what it means to be Nigerian;
to know grief,
to know God,
to know art,
to know no fault.
Because being Nigerian, means you’re a horde of rats, waiting to bell the cat.
But nobody bells it,
you instead become fruitful and multiply.
And the cat gets fat on your fear.
This is what it means to be Nigerian;
to know grief."
Undecorous Decalogue… The Nigerian politician’s 10 commandments,https://punocracy.com/undecorous-decalogue-the-nigerian-politicians-10-commandments/,2019-04-27T22:43:40+01:00,"1. And the god of National Cake, Aseus, spoke all these words chronicled in the Book of Ajanaku, saying: I am Aseus thy god, which have brought thee to the fertile state capital from the wilderness of your faraway village, out of the hut of poverty.
2. Thou shalt have no other gods before me, save for times when thou may use the god of Abaraham as an intercessor to me.
3. Thou shalt not keep in your treasury or spend any ungodly currency or any coins beneath your status as rulers of the tribe of Aireginians.
4. Though shalt not spend except the dollar, the pound, or the euro. And if thou are tempted by the devil to spend the accursed naira, thou must touch only that which is crisp, fragranced, and possesses three naughts in its name, for I Aseus thy god am a jealous god, visiting the iniquity of the rulers upon the ruled unto the third and fourth generation of them that defy me.
5. And shewing mercy unto millions of them that love me, keep my commandments, and line up to eat of the bounties of my cake.
6. Thou shalt be educated according to the scrolls that have been handed to you or those which thou hand to thyselves, and thou shalt strive to have names of faculties across the seas on thy scrolls though thou may have never set foot outside Airegin’s shores. I, Aseus, will not hold him guiltless that confesses his illiteracy or finds contentment only with faculties within the land.
7. Remember the election day to keep it unholy, filled with carnage and delinquency and persecution.
8. On one day, or a few more, shalt thou labour and do all thy work. But the other days are the sabbath of Aseus thy god, blessed and hallowed: In them thou shalt not do any work that may benefit the people, but thou shalt spend them in my worship or across the seas spending out of the bounties I have blessed thee with.
9. Honour thy people and thy servants, but only in your first term or when election is nigh, that thy days in office may be long upon the corridors of power which Aseus thy god giveth thee.
10. Thou may cause to be killed or locked up in my name, to put to sleep thy adversaries and lengthen thy days in office, but thou shalt not boast of thy deed to the hearing of the Aireginians lest thou ruin thy image.
11. Thou shalt commit adultery with whomsoever thou findeth pleasing, and if the Aireginians accuse thee of transgression thou shalt answer that it is nothing but thy business and it is thy wealth not theirs that thou lavish on the irresistible concubines.
12. By every means thou findeth, thou shalt steal. Again I say unto thee, thou shalt steal and embezzle and take from that which belongeth to the people. Thou shalt amass and amass until the wardrobes in thy bedchamber and the soakaways in thy yard have no room for a mouse’s twitchy nose. Thou shalt beg merchants from across the seas to keep thy stolen wealth and bless all lands but thine own with the bounties thou amass. And if thou are confronted, thou shalt answer that thy god hath revealed to thee in thy drunken phase this ageless wisdom that ‘stealing is not corruption’.
13. And remind them of the parable of the goat and the yam which many years ago we revealed to one of thy like in whom we are most proud, Goodluck the son of Jonathan. Verily, we say unto you as we said unto Goodluck that the similitude of the Nigerian politician is the goat which steals into a barn of succulent yam tubers. As it is the nature of the goat to eat regardless of who it was that planted or harvested, so also shall the politician steal that which neither he nor his ancestors had a hand in producing.
14. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour—save where thy neighbour belongs to the opposition camp in which case he deserves not a single shekel of pity and thou may paint him in whatever colour thou find proper. If he is from Airegin, thou may say to give an example that he haileth from the neighbouring town of Nooremac. If he is hale and hearty, thou may spread falsehood among the people that he hath passed on and hath been replaced with a look-alike from the Northern Kingdom of Nadus.
15. Thou shalt covet thy neighbour’s house, his wife, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, his ass (—four-legged ass, for sodomy is punishable under the law), and anything that is thy neighbour’s. Thou shalt covet thy superior’s position. Thou shalt covet thy inferior’s possessions. Thou shalt covet endless wealth and uncountable mansions. Thou shalt covet an endless life and seek out only the best physicians from across the sea. Thou shalt covet endless power and move from office to office, till the streets are filled with posters of only thine handsome face from when thou were 25 and running for councillor till thou are 95 and returning to the Senate. Thou shalt covet anything and everything, but thou shalt not covet retirement, for it is forbidden and angers thy lord.
16.  And the prophet said unto the queuing politicians, “Fear not for Aseus hath not come to bring thee sorrow and destruction but to grant thee coveted titles and everlasting pleasure.”
17. And the salivating politicians stood afar off, and the prophet drew near unto the thick icing of sugar where Aseus was seated in his full glory. And Aseus said unto the prophet, “Thus thou shalt say unto the people of Airegin, ye have seen that I have talked with you…”
18. An altar thou shalt make unto me in the place called Asokoro and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt (in other words, brown) envelopes, and thy peace (in other words, white) envelopes, and thy bodies if they possess mountains of sugar and honey, and thy riches. In all places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.
19. Thou shalt not grant the common man of Airegin entrance upon this altar for it is purposed as a safe haven for men of filthy riches. In like manner, wise men of the land may not be permitted to enter upon the sacred altar for their wisdom shall pollute the proud and empty mantras of the place. Any man anymore wiser than an ass, if he must enter, shall hand over his prudence at the gates and retrieve half thereof as he takes his leave.
20. My altar shall make the rich richer, the handsome handsomer, the stupid stupider, the fat fatter, and the sons of lesser-known somebodies somebodies themselves.
21. Thus saith the lord to his anointed, Ajanaku, whose right hand I have holden to bemuse the minds of those before him; and through him I will loose the loins of foolishness and cause them to open their gates to fresh understanding.

Atiku applies to US for Nigerian birth certificate,https://punocracy.com/atiku-applies-to-us-for-nigerian-birth-certificate/,2019-04-25T08:13:50+01:00,"WASHINGTON DC (The T.A. Report)― Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party in the 2019 general elections, may have applied to the United States Department of Health and Human Services as well as Justice Department for certificates of birth and “state of origin” to prove he’s Nigerian.
Sources told our New York correspondent the former vice president may have been led to believe he’s an actual citizen of the US or that the country offers such services.
“I don’t know… I think he was under the mistaken belief that he’s somehow become a citizen of the United States,” a senior administrative officer at the Health Department told the T.A. Report.
“Cases like this are really rare. We occasionally receive applications from people so obsessed with the US that they actually think they’ve acquired the country’s passport, but having someone apply for proof he’s a citizen of another country is just one-of-a-kind,” she added with a chuckle as she covered her mouth.
The officer said, often, such applicants are referred to state-owned healthcare centres for free psychiatric check-up, “but doing so in this case might stir up a nasty political crisis”.
A copy of the presidential candidate’s application obtained by our correspondent was signed with a Maryland home addressbelieved to have been soldin 2018.
Alabere Williams, a US-based Nigerian neurosurgeon, explained that the behavioural patterns of Atiku are suggestive of a condition known asparanoid schizophrenia.
“The man seems to see the United States as some sort of father or god figure whom he runs to whenever he’s in trouble, and the delusion is getting worse by the day,” he said with a concerned look.
“Someone has to tell him the US is a land of opportunities, not a land of magicians.”
The presidential candidate’s citizenship wascalled into questionrecently by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which argued that he is not qualified to be in the presidential race.

"Ngige refers to witch, native doctors…spiritual healers when he said ‘Nigeria has enough doctors’",https://punocracy.com/ngige-refers-to-witch-native-doctors-spiritual-healers-when-he-said-nigeria-has-enough-doctors/,2019-04-25T00:30:03+01:00,"Nigeria’s Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, says his‘Nigeria has enough doctors’statement was taken out of context and ‘was not interpreted objectively’.
The former Anambra state governor had received varying measures of backlashes for saying Nigerian doctors are free to leave the country because the country has enough.
Perhaps, in response to these backlashes, the minister has called a press briefing where he tried to shed more light on his earlier statement.
“When I said I’m not worried about doctors leaving Nigeria, many people took it out of context. The problem is that my statement was not interpreted objectively. And it saddens me. I mean, what is not clear in what I said?” Ngige queried.
“I was simply referring to witch doctors, native doctors, spiritual healers, local midwives, herb sellers, ehm…ehm…and so on, and so on. Or do you think these people aren’t doctors too? It is what we all know, only few Nigerians can afford the bill of white collar doctors like me.
“As for how surplus they are, conduct a survey; you would be surprised with the number of these people this country is blessed with.
“In my hometown Anambra, for instance, the number of witch doctors and native doctors we have in Okija shrine alone is uncountable. And like Okija, we have many other shrines in Anambra. This is how it is in all other states. Can you now see?
“Talking of spiritual healers, they are in our churches and mosques. We don’t have so many churches and mosques than other countries for nothing. The spiritual doctors in these religious centres cast demons, perform miracles, heal lepers, cure AIDS, cure cancers. This means they are doing the work of doctors too.”
The Minister also explained that the population of Nigerian doctors in the diaspora is proof that, technically, Nigeria has enough Nigerian doctors who “may not necessarily be practising in Nigeria”.
But, he added, whenever some big Nigerian politicians travel for medical trips abroad, “they are treated by these Nigerian doctors. Meaning, the only difference is where they work, they are still our own.”
He paused to adjust the microphone. He then pointed out President Muhammadu Buhari as a beneficiary of this during his last long medical trip to the UK where he spent more than 100 days.
“Please feel free to quote me. I’m sure people should be convinced and not confused that truly, we have more than enough doctors in the country.”
While at Chris Ngige’s explanation, Nigeria, according to World Bank data, has a ratio of0.395 for every 1000 Nigerians. Although, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) stipulates a national standard of 1 person to 600 doctors.
Comparatively, Austria, Italy and Switzerland respectively have, for every 1000 persons, 5.2, 4, and 4.2 doctors.China too, with a population of over 1.4 billion, has 1.9 doctors for the same number of persons.
It is believed that the minister’s statement, in spite of reality, came because of his years out of the hospital — either to test patients or to be tested himself. Reports flying around suggest that a team of doctors are planning to rescue the minister.

The crucifixion of Kolade Jackson: Easter verses as a portrait of police brutality,https://punocracy.com/the-crucifixion-of-kolade-jackson-easter-verses-as-a-portrait-of-police-brutality/,2019-04-21T06:32:58+01:00,"1. And Kolade Jackson went up to the sport amphitheatre, where the warriors of Liverpool and the warriors of Tottenham hath camped ready to battle.
2. He took his two friends apart, themselves stepsons of Liverpool, and said unto them: Behold, we go up to the centre, and the son of Liverpool shall be betrayed by the uniformed men of the state of Airegin, and, for no wise reason, they shall condemn him to death by the bullet’s sting.
3. And, before unleashing the bullet, shall pass him amongst themselves, as the Liverpoolians expertly toss the orb, to mock, and to scourge, and to rob, and to crucify him; and on the third year, or sooner, he shall rise again to fill the vase of revenge.
4. When the appointed hour cameth, the uniformed men of the state arrived at the amphitheatre when the battle most excited the people. And the people hath never seen anyone more fierce and ferocious and unfortunate as these men.
5. And Jackson stood before the leader of squad and the leader asked him: “Art thou a lover of football, the son of Liverpool?” And Jackson said unto him, “Thou sayest.”
6. Then said the leader unto him, “Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?” But Jackson answered nothing.
7. “They witness against thee five sins,” saith the leader: Of professing loyalty to the Liverpoolians in daylight, of permitting the touch of strange black lines on thy fair skin, of daring to speak English as the Queen of England speaketh the tongue, of having friends from across the seas as thy little screen divulged, and of oppressing the men of the state with thy gold and good looks.
8. Then the foot soldiers of the leader took Jackson to a nearby bush and gathered unto him the whole battalion as the people are wont to gather unto a Dominican pizza.
9. And they stripped him of his wine-coloured Liverpool jersey and put on him a scarlet robe.
10. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand … and they bent a knee before him—not as Jon Snow to Targaryen, but in a scornful way. And they mocked him saying, “Hail Jackson, lover of football and son of Liverpool!”
11. And they spat upon him, and took the reed from his right hand, and smote him on the head.
12. And after they had mocked him and taken from him all his gold, they took the filthy robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
13. As they came out from the bush, they found an old man of Daura, Bukari by name, on a high horse white as vanilla, and fifty horses of same class strutting behind him. Him they compelled to bear Jackson’s cross.
14. And there followed them a great company of people, of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
15. But Jackson, turning unto them, said, “Daughters of Airegin, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for thy children … for behold! The days shall come in which they shall say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.’ Then they shall begin to say to the rocks of Zuma, ‘Fall on us’, and to the hills of Ajuba, ‘Cover us!’ For if they do this in a democracy, what will happen if the rule is by the junta?”
16. And when they came unto a place called Asokoro, that is to say, a place of empty skulls and overflowing pouches, they crucified him and parted his garments.
17. And sitting down, they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation, written: THIS IS JACKSON OF MANGORO, LOVER OF FOOTBALL AND SON OF LIVERPOOL.
18. Then there were two other Aireginians crucified with him: The one on the right having a snake-like hairstyle grace his head as did Medusa of ancient Greece, and the one on the left a young man found with a horse so fine the men of the state cannot afford it.
19. And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads (and tails) and said, “If thou be the Son of Liverpool, save thyself as Alisson Becker saves his post from flying orbs.”
20. Now from the sixth hour darkness enveloped all the land unto the ninth hour.
21. And about the ninth hour, Jackson cried with a loud voice, saying, “Baladi! Baladi! Lama sabachthani?” That is to say, My country! My Country! Why hast thou forsaken me?
22. Terrified, one of the uniformed men of the state, Ogunyemew Lalekah by name, drew his pistol, and sent his bullet on an errand into Jackson’s chest.
23. Jackson, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
24. The rational men of Twitah and Phasbuk, seeing what had happened, praised God in different tongues and said, “Surely this was a righteous man, forced to ascend to the Lord Almighty in his prime.”
25. Then answered all the people, and said, “Cursed are the men of the state whose love for gold and enslavement of arms blind them from the love of their neighbours as themselves. Their’s is a great sin and, because of it, the blood of Jackson floweth through the land,  and on us, and on our children.”

"Though on steroids, Nigeria’s minimum wage loses badly at world Olympics",https://punocracy.com/though-on-steroids-nigerias-minimum-wage-loses-badly-at-world-olympics/,2019-04-20T09:31:03+01:00,"BEIJING (The T.A. Report)―  Nigeria’s minimum wage continues to give an embarrassing performance at the world stage, despite being on steroids, has lost to over 150 other nations at the just-concluded Global Minimum Wage Marathon.
The marathon, popularly called the Olympics of minimum wage, took place in Beijing, China, on Friday and had participant-athletes from 170 countries.
Nigeria’s minimum wage was ranked 155th at the end of the competition, even though it had been administered a performance-enhancing drug the previous day: the New Minimum Wage Bill, certified by the National Assembly as safe for ingestion andapproved by the president.
This drug, the T.A. Report learnt, doubled the strength of the country’s minimum wage and increased its chances of winning at the global competition by at least 100 per cent. However, Nigeria only moved up two places from its position the previous year.
Maintaining their position as thetop five performerswere Australia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Ireland, and France.
Nigeria is also one of the least performing countries in Africa. Algeria, whose player isranked the tenth beston the continent, has a score of $295, compared to Nigeria’s $83.
Raimi Olowolonjaiye, president of the Higher Wage Lower Rage Initiative, said he has a way out of the national embarrassment.
“It’s simple, really. We need to fire that stupid athlete!” he told our reporter in a phone interview.
” Let us face the reality. No amount of steroids can improve its performance significantly. We need an entirely new player, forward-looking and with fresh blood. Someone who understands global politics and social welfare.
“This may be an expensive approach, but we can achieve it. We are after all headed for the next level,” he added.
Nigeria’s abysmally poor-performing minimum wage has been a subject of controversy for years. Analysts say even the newly administered steroids may not have a nationwide effect, as state governors have already started lamenting their inability to afford the drug.

Opinion: Is satire in Nigeria worth the try?,https://punocracy.com/opinion-is-satire-in-nigeria-worth-the-try/,2019-04-20T08:18:30+01:00,"By: Shayera Dark
This July, as heavy rains engulfed the streets, Lagos residents turning on their televisions were greeted with what looked like a standard news show detailing the crisis in Nigeria.
“The weekend rains brought serious flooding to parts of Lagos Mainland,” intoned the anchor. “Uber responded by announcing a new service,” he continued as an image of a woman in the canoe appeared over his shoulder. The caption read: “Uber Canoe Coming Soon”.
This was no ordinary news programme, however. It wasThe Other News, a weekly satirical show hosted by Nigerian comedian Okey Bakassi. Following a similar style and format toThe Daily Show with Trevor Noahin the US,The Other Newscovers domestic and international affairs in a satirical way. Since its July debut, the show’s audience has risen steadily, guaranteeing it a second season.
The success ofThe Other Newsdemonstrates the demand for home-grown satire in Nigeria. More people are tuning in to watch programmes such as Bakassi’s or turning to YouTube to watch shows such asAdeola’s Show(previouslyKeeping It Real), which received over 90,000 views per episode in its former incarnation.
This growing popularity even inspired a two-daySatire Festivallast month. Hosted in Abuja, the event combined panel discussions with performances that, among many other things, included an irreverent “roast” of the president and a cheeky awards ceremony for Nigeria’s worst-performing governor.
Nigeria has a history of artistes using creative methods to question power. Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti notoriously lampooned the military government in his music. Lemi Ghariokwu, the cartoonist who created Fela’s album sleeves, did the same through art. Meanwhile,Chinua Achebeand Wole Soyinka both employed satire in their literature.
Many critics of the government are now employing to similar methods, albeit in some different forms, today.
“Satire [acts] like a mirror just showing you back yourself, without speaking at you and telling you what you’re doing wrong,” says Yemi Adesanya, who co-founded The Nigerian Satire Festival along with Ose Anenih.
For cartoonist Mike Asukwo, all figures in power are fair game when it comes to poking fun. For the past 12 years, he has used art to critique countless politicians.
“When it comes to political figures, I try to make sure that I don’t create no-go areas,” he says. “If you’re out there and you call yourself a public servant, just be sure that one way or another you’re going to appear in my cartoons.”
This approach is not necessarily easy, however. Nigeria ranks 122 out of 180 countries onpress freedomsand criticising powerful people comes with real risks. This was a concern among the festival organisers, which is why they chose to open it on 16 November, the UN’s International Day for Tolerance.
“Satire when you’re at the receiving end of it isn’t always funny, and we accept that fact,” says Anenih.
For many of Nigeria’s satirists, criticising those in power also comes with more indirect difficulties today.
“The problem is that politicians and their friends control all the platforms that could support shows,” notes Rudolf Okonkwo, host ofDr Damages, which is currently broadcast on YouTube where episodes receive tens of thousands of views.
He says that he has approached Nigerian networks about running his satirical show, but they have been concerned about the repercussions. “They asked that I tone it down. The people who run those platforms fear that the politicians would not like it,” he said by email.
Satirical blogger Okechukwu Ofili echoes this and goes further in suggesting that those in authority are able to inhibit criticism in a variety of ways through their networks of power.
He says that “big radio stations are dependent on the government”. Meanwhile, he adds that musicians are also indebted to the state by virtue of the fact that they are often funded by corporations, which rely on the government for contracts and favours in turn.
“Fela was able to make fun of government because he wasn’t dependent on them,” he says.
Nigeria’s satirists are nonetheless battling through the difficulties to get heard. However, here as elsewhere in the world, there is an age-old question over whether satire can lead to genuine change or whether it simply acts as a safety valve for people’s frustrations. This certainly divides observers in Nigeria.
According to arts and culture critic Oris Aigbokhaevbolo, the Abuja satire festival was commendable but unlikely to make much difference. He suggests that the elites who really ought to hear the critiques would stay away, but might send their children instead.
“The kids will have a good time and then it’s the reset button for everyone by dawn,” he says. “[Attendees] will laugh and put off protesting for another day. Not that anyone can blame them.”
SatiristElnathan Johnis similarly cautious about the role of satire in Nigeria. In atweet, he commented, “Nigerians don’t want any real satire. They’d burn down the station. They want weak impotent comedy they can giggle at.”
However, as satire grows in popularity in Nigeria, some disagree. They warn against dismissing this comedic, smart and playful approach to registering dissatisfaction too soon.
“The only way we can make people change is to show them what is wrong, what is not working, or what is absurd,” says Adesanya.

"SARS most feared phenomenon in Nigeria after Boko Haram, says UN agency",https://punocracy.com/sars-most-feared-phenomenon-in-nigeria-after-boko-haram-says-un/,2019-04-15T00:12:21+01:00,"WASHINGTON DC (The T.A. Report)―  Nigeria’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Police Force, is the second most feared ‘thing’ by citizens of the country, new research has shown.
A copy of the study, released on Monday by the United Nations Phobia Research Agency (UNPRA), was obtained by the T.A. Report.
Its findings, based on an extensive poll and data mined from news reports as well as social media platforms, show that the terrorist group, Boko Haram, remains the most frightening phenomenon in Nigeria since it launched its military campaign ten years ago.
Curiously taking second place, however, is the police unit established to combat robbery in the country. Coincidentally, it was foundedaround the same timeas the extremist group.
“It has never happened before that an agency of government under a democratic rule will instil so much fear in the hearts of the people,” said Gregor Lannister, president of UNPRA.
“Since we started publishing this study in 1987, we have not seen people complain about a police unit as though it were some offshoot of Al-Qaeda or ISIS.”
Meanwhile, the report also disclosed that the third most fearsome phenomenon to Nigerians is visa application denial. Equally on the list were herdsmen, traffic congestion, underpants disappearance, queues (especially for elections), food insufficiency at parties, good leadership, and flat mobile phone batteries.
When we contacted Garba Shehu, senior special adviser to the president on media, he politely pleaded to be given some time to react as “everyone at the villa is busy with the election tribunal problem”.
“We are still trying to prove Atiku is not a Nigerian and you know how difficult that is getting by the day,” he explained. “Please call me again after the swearing-in ceremony in May.”
The UNPRA report is coming on the heels of encomiums and awards showered on the (in)famous police department, whose officials are known for their black uniforms, inquisitiveness, thug-like appearances, and fondness for ATMs.
On Friday, SARS received an award from the Black Axe Confraternity, also called the Neo-Black Movement of Africa, as the 2018 ‘Most Sophisticated Gang’ on the continent. The president of the group, Adewale Badoo, in presenting the award at the confraternity’s annual convention in Abuja, said SARS “has distinguished itself as one of the most dreaded cults in the world”.
“What stands them out though is that they are able to operate in the open and have penetrated government such that their weapons and uniforms are bought using state resources,” he’d added.
“How cool is that, huh?” Badoo asked with a beaming face, directing the question to no one in particular.
SARS operatives, reports have shown, have advanced techniques through which they easily detect criminal suspects.
The same way anti-terrorism squads are always on the lookout for explosives, a security expert told our reporter, the operatives have a special nose for such red flags as expensive smart phones and laptops, uncommon hairstyles, full beards, and tattoos—really, anything young-looking, modern, or expensive.
There have been widespread campaigns for the ban of the establishment, but it appears Nigeria’s head of state, Muhammadu Buhari, has turned deaf ears to the clamours.
Rumour has it that the #EndSARS campaign on Twitter may have been presented as #SendSARS in security and media reports that make it to the president’s desk.

BREAKING: UI to change name to University of Intolerance,https://punocracy.com/ui-to-change-name-to-university-of-intolerance/,2019-04-13T13:31:26+01:00,"Soon, Nigeria’s premier university, University of Ibadan, will seize to be called its name. Plans have been set to change its current name to the University of Intolerance.
This move is contained in a memo signed by the Vice Chancellor of the university, Abel Olayinka, a copy of which was obtained by Punocracy.
The memo says the decision to change the school’s name is to reinforce the stance of the school’s management on protest or any form of criticism or public engagements.
It is coming against the backdrop of the outgoing week’s suspensions slammed on students who were said to have led a “peaceful protest” in May, 2017.
“Be it civil or not, all forms of criticism are prohibited in this great university of ours,” the memo states.
“Students are, henceforth, expected to comply with the decisions of the school, be it that they like it or not. Since the school won’t do anything that is against the interest of the students, we do not expect them to question us whenever any action is taken by us. It distracts us. After all, they are of limited academic, age and cerebral maturity to discern right from wrong.
“Any student who defaults risks suffering the same fate as Ojo Aderemi or Asiwaju Ibrahim and co — or worse. We mean it. This is why we plan to change our school’s name to University of Intolerance. Plans to bring this to life are intact.
“This means zero tolerance for all forms of critiques. Zero tolerance for press freedom. Zero tolerance for intellectual engagements. Zero tolerance for complaints. Zero tolerance for critical thinking.
“Thinking otherwise is against the student matriculation oath, and it has as punishment either of suspension or rustication.
“We won’t fold our arms, watching a bunch of beardless inexperience undergraduates drag our years of academic experience into the muddy water of disregard. Let it be clear: whatever thought comes from us is the best anywhere. It is flawless. This is why Nigeria is where it is.
“The vision of our institution is to mould law abiding citizens who respect constituted authorities. Not ones who rebel against power, either by protest, ill-mannered articles, or even social media posts seen to be challenging the management.”
It is unclear, however, how the school’s mantra “recte sapere fons” — for learning and sound judgement —  will matter if there is no room for asking critical questions by members of the school.
It was further mentioned in the memo that the nation has to be careful in the kind of youths it breeds. It cited the uprisings in “Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Venezuela, Algeria, and just this week Sudan, are examples we need to fight against.”
“Parents are, therefore, advised to monitor their wards more to prevent them from losing their studentship.”
Although the school’s declaration centres around students’ criticism, it is not public knowledge yet what plans the school have for criticism coming from the staff quarters.
Report has shown that no session passes in the University of Ibadan (or University of Intolerance) without any or both of the staff Unions going on strike. Yet, the report adds, the management has never suspended any union member for staging a protest.
To change the name of a federal government owned university is subject to ratification by the Federal Executive Council (FEC).
Caveat: This is a work of satire. Names or anything that has semblance with them, persons, wise or otherwise, offices, high or low, authorities, constituted or unconstituted, are as a result mixture of the author’s imagination and inspiration from Above, and any semblance of actual persons, far or near, organizations or body is the handiwork of Mr Coincidence.

"Omi tuntun washes off Penkele’s mess in UI, UItes claim",https://punocracy.com/omi-tuntun-washes-off-penkeles-mess-in-ui-uites-claim/,2019-03-10T15:30:48+01:00,"Rain, which many residents of the University of Ibadan have termed“omi tuntun” (sign of new dawn), has yesterday done a great deal of wreck to some amenities of the university.
Many of the respondents our reporter spoke with believe that the rain had come to cleanse what they called “penkele’s mess” — a term used to describe the largesse given to Halls of residence in the school a week ago.
Mr Adebayo Adelabu, earlier last week campaigned with N2.5million — N250,000 to each of 10 halls in the school. A money he said the students could use for “akara and bread”.
Coming a week to the governorship election, the gesture was seen by many as vote buying while some student leaders saw it as an avenue to enrich themselves.
The gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, whose grandfather, Adegoke Adelabu, was a prominent Oyo politician in the 50’s, all through his campaign usedPenkelemeesias his campaign catchphrase.
Penkelemeesi, originally peculiar mess, but was corrupted by locals, was made popular by the older Adelabu.
Having lost the polling units in the university, it was believed that the largesse by the APC flagbearer was to appease the voters in the school.
However, it turned out not to work as the party again lost in the same manner it did a fortnight ago.
With the downpours experienced on the election day, many claimed it is a sign of new dawn as it has washed off the bad omen brought by the party’s luck in the school.
Bayo Seyi, a student of Electioneering Science, told Yesterday’s Today that he’s proud of the way UItes showed that their votes can’t be bought.
“As you can see, we did not follow the crowd. He [Adebayo Adelabu] gave our Halls money and our so-called student leaders shared the money among themselves — instead of using it for a meaningful project.
“So, because God watches all that we do, he made rain to fall to wash out all the evils of the land. Omi tuntun de! Omi tuntun has washed off all the mess.”
Labu Makinde another student of Voting Engineering shares this belief too. She said she believes that the damages done by the rain on the school has connection with the booty shared a week ago.
She added that it is good UItes are “showing others the way.”
“That is why we are the first and the best. I wonder where the student leaders who got the money and pocketed it would put their faces now. Let them bury their faces in shame.
“I’m really disappointed in them. How would you spend money meant for all among few? It is bad. Same set of people would blame the government for wrongdoing. They don’t know it all starts from this stage.
“Well, I’m happy that God has shown them their wrongdoing by making them lose in spite of the money. Omi tuntun has come to clean up their mess, the penkele mess.”
The formal announcement of results is ongoing at the state INEC collation headquarters, Agodi Secretariat, Oyo State.
So far, PDP has won far more local governments than the APC.
Election bookmakers and voting experts have predicted that it is only if the sun goes cold or Governor Ajimobi apologizes to all residents of the state before the APC can overturn the deficit so far.
Reports also have it that the governor is already packing his bags and planning to return to Lebanon.
Caveat: This is a work of satire. Names or anything that has semblance with them, persons, wise or otherwise, offices, high or low, authorities, constituted or unconstituted, are as a result mixture of the author’s imagination and inspiration from Above, and any semblance of actual persons, far or near, organizations or body is the handiwork of Mr Coincidence.

REVIEW: A peep at Elnathan John’s witty takes on Be(com)ing Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/review-a-peep-at-elnathan-johns-witty-takes-on-becoming-nigeria/,2019-03-10T07:24:42+01:00,"ByJerry Chiemeke
In a system that is subtly oppressive or significantly untrue to governmental principles it claims to uphold, there has to be someone who is bold enough to question the establishment.
Satire, while usually delivered in a humorous tone, is given expression with the aim of drawing attention to issues, particular and widely ranged, in a given society. It is not meant to please, it operates to disturb the comfortable, and the principal intent is to shame key stakeholders and institutions of society that have failed in their duty to the people, until a marked improvement is shown. Whether in musical lyrics, television shows or Internet memes, it must flow without fear or favour. Otherwise, it is no longer satire.
Elnathan John, lawyer and novelist, has been in the forefront of Nigerian satire for a significant number of years. The 36-year-old, whose works have been shortlisted for the Caine Prize for African Writing and the NLNG-sponsored Nigeria Prize for Literature, has been actively involved in canvassing for the rights of women as well as ethnic and sexual minorities in his tweets and his blog columns.
Not one to back down from fierce intellectual engagement, the author of Born On A Tuesday (which in itself is a fictional narrative bordering on insurgency and religious fanaticism) is known for using his penmanship to tackle relevant socio-political issues with a blend of candour and cheeky sarcasm, and is quick to describe himself as “being in an abusive relationship with Nigeria.”
Be(com)ing Nigeria: A Guide, published by Cassava Republic Press, is a non-fictional book that attempts to shed light on the Nigerian condition with all the non-inciting but brutal honesty that satire demands.
It could be seen as a collection of essays, wherein John captures (almost) all the things that are wrong with the polity in the nicest way possible. He expresses his intent to ruffle feathers in the first few pages, wherein he dedicates the book “to all who feel personally attacked or offended by something” he would write. The first chapter begins a largely altered and ‘nationalised’ account of the biblical creation story, which runs along the lines of:
“In the beginning the British created the Northern and Southern protectorates. Now, the nation was formless and empty and darkness covered our collective identity.
And the British said: ‘Let there be Nigeria.’ And there was Nigeria. And the British saw that Nigeria was good (for them) and they separated the ruling class from the serfs.
And the British said: ‘Just as we have a vault between us and you, let there be a vault to separate the rulers from the citizens.’
So the British created Nigeria in their own image, in the image of their colonial rulership they created it; oppressor and oppressed they created them. And there was independence from the British and there were coups and counter coups and there were military dictators.
And the decades passed and the military rulers stripped their garbs and uniforms and transformed into civilian rulers. And they declared: ‘Old things have passed away and all things have become new…’
This sets the tone for the rest of the book, with thinly veiled digs and not-so-subtle jabs thrown at virtually everyone: the government is called out for enabling the monopoly exercised by a certain renowned business tycoon, the randy clergymen gets a mention for displaying “a level of grace that we do not understand”, and the overly religious are indicted for the sanctimonious manner in which they conduct their affairs, with references to the fact that “the Nigerian God doesn’t care if you have neighbours and neither should you. When you are worshipping in your house, make sure the neighbours can’t sleep. Use loud speakers even if you are only two in the building. Anyone who complains must be evil. God will judge such a person.”
There are also commentaries on the manner in which journalists conduct news reporting (especially in the event of tragedy), the subtle fraud perpetrated by (a few) Non-Governmental Organisations, general attitude of Nigerians to time management, and the tendency to resort to denial as a coping mechanism in the face of health complications. Politicians and creatives are not spared either, and there are more than a few words that add up to a comedic depiction of the lifestyle depicted by returnees, expatriates and social media enthusiasts. How To Show Love is an essay that paints a picture of the chauvinism and emotional abuse that bedevils Nigerian relationships, and child labour is elaborately discussed here too.
A few of the essays in this compilation may not be new to ardent followers of Elnathan John’s blog, but the delivery is no less potent when all the pieces are placed together. The writing is irreverent, witty, and savage in certain portions, with adequate sprinklings of sarcasm.
It is a more wholesome version of Bayo Olupohunda’s Are You Not A Nigerian? and more third-person in nature than Victor Ekikhamenor’s Excuse Me. You just wish that he did not have to use the term “hustle” to an ad nauseam effect. It is worthy of note, too, how this book proves that most of the problems pointed out in Peter Enahoro’s 1966 classic, How To Be A Nigerian, still exist to the day, with little hope for any positive change.
Elnathan John’s latest offering is not without its hitches though. Some paragraphs fail to pack the punch, and sometimes you feel that there are parts where he could have gone in with the bite of column entries like, My Penis Makes Everything Ok (a notable omission from this collection). He is guilty of excessive rambling in one or two essays as well, and a little bit of ‘Naija-speak’ would have definitely spiced up the narratives.
These are, ultimately, negligible ‘misgivings’ (if they could be regarded as such), and they take little away from the slice of genius that is Be(com)ing Nigeria: A Guide.
This body of work is well-constructed if it were to be compared to a lego house, it is relevant (not least due to Nigeria’s heated political climate), and it is proof that Satire is by no means a dead art form in these parts.

"‘Underage voting is not new, and certainly not wrong!’",https://punocracy.com/underage-voting-is-not-new-and-certainly-not-wrong/,2019-03-09T23:20:10+01:00,"In Nigeria, only persons above the age of 18 are eligible to vote in an election. Therefore, anyone below 18 is regarded as underaged and consequently ineligible.
However, while explaining and justifying underage voting as characteristic of Nigerian elections over the years and particularly in the 2019 elections, Professor Adekelvin Adegorioye, a Don of Political Science at the University of Cobweb Island (UCI), has described underage voting as a phenomenon which is “not new and certainly not wrong”.
He said this while passing comments on the 2019 elections and the electoral practices.
According to the Don, “underaged voting is expected, is particularly pertinent at this time and should be encouraged”.
“When parents do not register for voter’s card; do not go back to collect their voter’s card or do not go out to vote and only lament that the results have been decided before the election, the wise children go out to vote and save their future. At least, it is also their country and they have the right to decide who make policies that directly or indirectly affect their lives”, he said.
“In another case, a smart parent knows the importance of allowing his/her child to vote. The benefit is huge! Take for instance, where parties offer money or food items, your reward for voting is doubled when your child ( or if you are blessed, children) tags along to vote”.
“I do not see anything bad in it, so far the child knows how to move his/her finger, and can think of where to drop it, he/she is no more a child irrespective of the influences or factors that influenced his/her choice”, he concluded.
Speaking to an underaged voter who is 12 years old and identified as Kamilu Omoloso at PU 010, Ward 01 Ayekooto LGA, Alatakun state, he said “my friends and I came to vote because we want to put food on the table of our family”.
“We have been providing for our family since we were 6. We do all sorts of work. Voting is also a work; so far it puts food on the table. We vote and get paid 5k — an amount we naturally earn only after working for three weeks”, he added.
Another underaged voter who is 14 and identified as Musiliu Ajayi said he came to vote because he cannot open wide his eyes while a stick is being poked in it.
“When my big sisters and brothers wouldn’t come out to vote, I decided to instead. They are busy tweeting and analysing candidate’s strengths and weaknesses on social media but would not come out to vote. I realised that the real strength is on the thumb and paper so I decided to do what they wouldn’t do by coming out to vote”, he said.

PROGNOSIS: 10 things to look out for 10 years from now given the rise of small parties in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/prognosis-10-things-to-look-out-for-10-years-from-now-given-the-rise-of-small-parties-in-nigeria/,2019-03-09T19:44:32+01:00,"Man is insatiable. If science wasn’t your thing and you were sent to the Commercial—or Arts—class back at secondary school, you would have come across this theory postulated by the father of economics himself: Adam Smith. What your economics teacher forgot to mention though is that Nigerians are even more insatiable than the average man. We always want more—more degrees and certificates, more titles, more terms in office, more meats in our food, and, needless to add, more money.
This is why, by 2050, Nigeria would have moved from number sevento number threeon the table of most populated countries in the world, flying above the heads of even Indonesia and the United States of America. While these countries know when to erect the stop sign, for us it is only Madame Menopause that can tell us when to stop having more children. After all, the more the merrier.
This same insatiable attitude has infiltrated our political system, such that we can’t seem to get enough of political parties.
Parties have become like drugs and erotica. You start small but, before you know it, the usual dose doesn’t excite you anymore. It slowly begins to get boring and ineffective. So what do you do? You opt for more. More adventure. More variety. More intensity.
Political parties are now like petty businesses. Hey! Has your friend, Bimpe, just set up a pretty successfulogiandakarabusiness close to the church? What are you waiting for? Quickly erect your kiosk beside hers and make sure you get a piece of that goldmine. Our politicians now seem to favour the sole-proprietorship compared to partnerships. ‘Better to be the national chairman of an unknown party than to join the queue in a known platform,’ they preach to whoever cares to listen.
In this prognosis, we take a look at how having more and more parties is likely to play out ten or so years from now, and the various angles to this development. Okay. Maybe not ten years… but you sure get the drift.
In the Nigeria of the future, we will need special technological tools to accommodate all the parties that will spring forth. A special kind of printer will be ordered fromthe abroadto print the ballot papers. The ballot papers themselves will possibly look like wallpapers, and will have to be folded using a yet-to-be-invented machinery. The alternate eventuality is that nanotechnology be deployed to produce not-too-big ballot papers with super small font size. And then voters will be given magnifying lens and laser guns to exercise their franchise.
Political parties become items of luxury that distinguish elites from ordinary men. Introductions at public functions will go: “My name is Chief Dr Olanipekun Owonikoko, and I am the founder and chairman of the Owonikoko for Show Party (OSP)”. Yeap! Parties will be named after people.
Political parties will be the new MMM. Or the newYahoo plus. Parents will push their kids into getting one — or more for themselves.
“Hey Soji! Don’t you see that Bamidele has become a millionaire since he established his 30 Billion Gang Political Party? Does he have two heads? When are you going to start yours? I also want to eat the fruits of my labour o!” will be the cry of mothers and fathers to their yet-to-arrive children.
Well, this is also a possibility, ain’t it? But not really a delightful one. By the time one in five adult Nigerians become owners of one party or the other, since INEC is no magician, collation may gulp one, two, three, or even four years. What is the implication of this? The incumbent gets an automatic added term in office. Or wait… perhaps, he even becomes a life president… especially with collation officers needing reading lamps and rulers for better sight. By the time INEC is ready to declare the winner, it is already time for another election to be conducted. And we keep repeating this cycle until … well until our professor-mathematicians come up with home-grown formulas to expedite the process.
We already have strange party acronyms: CAP, APP, ID, MAJA, RAP, YES, and so on. Very soon, we will see the emergence of MMM, OBO, RIP, SS, SOS, etc. etc. We will have so many parties getting an acronym that is available will be difficult as hell. Just as there is a CAC public search for company names, INEC will launch a similar portal for people intending to start a new party — just to make sure their desired acronyms have not been reserved by another person or group.
Today, the results often sound like GPN 12, HDP 07, ID, 04, JMPP 14, KP 10… But by 2031, what we will rather be seeing on our screens will be RIG 01, SICK 00, VIP, 00, AYE 01 … almost like we have decided to adopt a binary numbering system for our votes. Numbers between 2 and 9 will become scarcer, and any party able to get as many as 2-3 votes will have huge cause for celebration.
Needless to say, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the boom era of smaller parties will be designers, logo makers especially. Apparently, asides the name, the other most important thing about a party is its logo. The lines. The colours. The choice of emblems and animals.Ah-mean, when it comes to content development, no one really gives one hoot about aim and objectives, mission and vision, ideologies, constitution, and that useless one they call manifesto. Graphic designers should therefore get ready for a career make-over that’ll financially elevate them above university professors and possibly even medical doctors.
We have seen parties dedicated to interests of young people, parties for socialists, parties for those in the labour market and so on and so forth. What does the future hold? Certainly more specificity. We will start to see parties named after and promoting the interests of … er… crossdressers, sexual workers,okadamen, cybercriminals etc. etc. We would have, for instance, Yahoo Boys Party of Nigeria (YBPN), The Dropouts Political Movement (TPPM), Social Media People’s Party (SMPP), GOT Lovers Party (GoTLP), and any other you can think of. Our democracy will truly be more colourful.
Having a political party will not only be profitable for the party men, there will also be entrepreneurial middlemen who will buy and sell registered parties. Just as we haveresellersof domain names, we will equally have folks hoarding political parties and then auctioning them in political black markets. Much later, you might even start finding party dealers on OLX and Jumia.
We will also be exporting to countries where democracy is not thriving so well. North Korea, China, and Sudan, for example, will turn out to be perfect trading partners. I can already see Nigeria’s foreign-exchange reserves rise like Ijebu garri that has been soaked for two days.
Hypothetical advert: “Parties are the new gold. But there are parties and there are parties. With the Light at the End of the Tunnel Party (LET Party), your elite social status and political future will be secured. Not only is the name classy and melodious, our logo is like none other. We have 12,000 likes on Facebook, 24,000 followers on Twitter, and 27,000 on Instagram. There are 27 registered members already, and they are all polygamous! It can’t get any better than this. The price is just N499,999.99.”
With the rise and spread of INEC-recognised political platforms, other money-making associations such as Student Unions, National Association of Nigerian Students, and various trade unions will gradually be devalued and deemphasised. The number of persons aspiring to become SU presidents and NLC chairmen will reduce drastically and these associations will eventually lose relevance and liquidate. What is in vogue are the political parties. Why wait to collect crumbs from top politicians when you can discuss merger opportunities and endorsement prices as partners… Right? Right?
This goes without saying. As all party agents are traditionally invited to the collation centres so they can witness the process and challenge perceived irregularities, the typical venues will soon be insufficient in accommodating them. What then is the solution? We’ll move to open-air collation centres, football stadiums … or maybe even churches. The new Dunamis International Gospel Centre in Abuja with a 100,000 seating capacity would be a good start."
Ajimobi is still my father—Penkelemesi,https://punocracy.com/ajimobi-is-still-my-father-penkelemesi/,2019-03-05T03:23:02+01:00,"He said while he jokingly boxed our reporter on the Facebook chat…
With just few days
to the governortorial, I mean, gubernatorial election, the candidate of the All
Progressives Congress in Oyo State, Mr Bayo Adelabu popularly known as
Penkelemesi, has reaffirmed the political superiority of the incumbent
governor, Senator(less) Isiaka Abiola Ajimobi, by saying that he remains his
father.
The reaffirmation
was contained in a friendly Facebook chat between the hopeful and our
correspondent.
Late yesterday, a campaign audio file said to be from the ruling party started circulating on WhatsApp and Telegram literally begging the people of Oyo state to vote Mr Penkelemesi of the APC in the coming state elections.
The audio file was
recorded and seem to have the signature of a local poet widely known as
Ologundudu who claimed he had been sent by President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice
President Yemi Osinbajo to appeal to the people of Oyo State to overlook the
“big mouth” and excesses of the incumbent governor and not visit his
sins on the party’s gubernatorial hopeful.
However, in a rather
surprising twist of event, Mr Penkelemesi has disclaimed the audio file that
has since gone viral saying the audio is not aligning with his political
ideology of godfatherism and though it was the idea of the party, he is
personally not cool with it as that is tantamount to betraying his political
godfather, the current governor of the state.
“I have said it during governorship debates and I will say it again, Ajimobi is my father and he is still my father. There is nothing anybody can say that will make me abandon him to his sinking ship because we have been together on that ship.
“They said he has a ‘big mouth’, they said he is insensitive and that he talks anyhow to people, but I have just a question to the people peddling these, is that a crime? See, though I am a banker but I know my rights and I know when something is wrong under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Daddy Ajimobi has not done anything against the law!” He shouted during the chat.
“The Yoruba peopele have a saying thatẹlẹ́nu rírùn ló l’àmù ìyá ẹwhich means that though the governor has ‘mouth odor’, I, Adebayo Adelabu, still find the water of wisdom oozing from his mouth highly refreshing.”
“I love Boda Biola and if not that I happen to be a beneficiary of the Penkelemesi name from my grandfather, I would have even chosen Boda Biola over my grandfather anytime, any day …well, my grandfather is dead anyway, so I will have no trouble in choosing a living over the dead…,” he said while adding a 😬.
“If people say Ajimobi is arrogant, that is their headache. People
will always say rubbish about others in power. whether they decide to vote us
or not, nothing can stop our victory…they can go to hell, ours is the NEXT
LEVEL, o ti penkele,” he concluded with his campaign slogan and a string
of laugh with tears emojis 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Recall that the Oyo
State governor,  Abiola Ajimobi of the
APC, who is notorious  for very
undiplomatic and uncouth utterances had lost in his senatorial bid to return to
the National Assembly after an eight-year stint as a governor.
It was said that after winning the second term as a governor, he started to see himself as a mini-god in the league of Late Lamidi Adedibu, he even gave himself a title “Kòṣẹlẹ̀rí” (It has never happened before) but it seemed that when the old senator thought he had seen and conquered all of Ibadan, the Ibadan people rerouted him to Layipo and he obviously did not survive the puzzle.
Meanwhile, Sahara
Reporters had reported that Tinubu, the grand godfather, had banned Ajimobi
from appearing at APC governorship rallies in a bid to save the party from
extinction but most importantly to guard against Ajimobi ridiculous statements
and questions like, “You, where is your compound here in Ibadan? Who is
your father? Did you vote for me? You did not? You lack respect for constituted
authority” and so on and so forth.
Chill! This is a satire and if I have to tell you that before you know then I think you really deserve to be a Nigerian!"
We want our own constituency at NASS — internet users tell INEC,https://punocracy.com/we-want-our-own-constituency-at-nass-internet-users-tell-inec/,2019-03-03T07:24:46+01:00,"TELEGRAM (The T.A. Report)― Protesting against what they call “prolonged and under-reported marginalisation”, Nigeria’s internet users have urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Federal Government to include social media constituencies at the Senate and House of Representatives.
This appeal was made public shortly after the Annual General Meeting of the Social Media Influencers and Influencees of Nigeria (SMIIN) held on Saturday on Telegram.
“We are tired of this marginalisation,” Paul Ezeudoh, @TweetOracle, who is the association’s president, told our reporter. “It has been going on for too long, and we have no choice now but to speak out.”
“The presidential election held last Saturday has shown that the Nigerian government is bent on disenfranchising the large internet community in this country,” he continued.
“INEC should know we have special needs. Not only were we not allowed to vote, we also do not have representatives at the National Assembly to champion our interests and give us constituency projects. We have been tactically abandoned.”
Asked why SMIIN’s members did not simply go out to vote, @TweetOracle replied that the world has moved past elections revolving around ballot papers.
“C’mon,” he said, expressing both surprise and derision at the enquiry, “this is the 21st-goddamn-century. Everything has moved to the internet now.
“Already, we can buy food on the internet, go to school on the internet, get married via the internet, even have sex through the internet… Why in the world shouldn’t we be able to vote on the internet? Our members are 24/7 netizens. We really do not have time for unnecessary physical activities.”
Tunde Ednut, breadwinner of the Shade Room of Africa who is one of SMIIN’s top executives, told The T.A. Report that is an embarrassment for members of the internet community to not have their online polls reflect in the nationwide votes.
“We are Nigerians too, you know. It still baffles us how Omoyele Sowore, Kingsley Moghalu and Fela Durotoye got more votes on Twitter alone than in the whole of the country. It just shows that we are an entirely different state, with different political leanings,” said Ednut, whocollapsed last yeardue to sleeplessness and constant browsing.
“This is why we are calling on the Federal Government. Even if we won’t be given digital Permanent Voters’ Cards and allowed to participate in the polls online with our own Resident Electoral Commissioner, at least they should give us seats at the National Assembly.”
Given the results of various polls conducted on the internet in the buildup to the general elections, many Nigerians had expected Sowore, Moghalu, or Atiku Abubalar to be declared winner. A new study has, however, revealed that social media has not fully penetrated the Northern region, especially the 3 K’s of Kano, Kaduna, and Katsina. The study also found that internet users in the South are 72 percent more likely to spend their day trolling, mailing subs, or watching Game of Thrones, than voting for their preferred candidates.

VAR to be used to determine true winners of Feb 23 elections,https://punocracy.com/var-to-be-used-to-determine-true-winners-of-feb-23-elections/,2019-03-02T21:04:14+01:00,"ABUJA —ALL hope may not be lost to restore the “stolen mandates” of top politicians in Nigeria’s Feb 23 presidential and national assembly elections. This is because a new technology has been invented to replay scenes of voting.
This new technology is the Voters Assistant Replayer (VAR). It is capable of capturing scenes of voting across the country and thereafter replaying those scenes to confirm whether or not an election was free and fair.  By it, real winners of elections are known without stress.
VAR took its cue from the Video Assistant Referee recently introduced into the game of football. Like the latter, the Voters Assistant Replayer is targeted at curbing fraud and ensuring fairness in a process.
Unveiling the new invention Saturday in Abuja, Engr Butiku Akpabio, the Chief Researcher of War Against Rigging Limited, a multinational technology company headquartered in California, USA, said a lot has been put into research, and his company is really happy that their investment is seeing the light of the day.
“We are happy to announce this breakthrough after years of research. It’s been a research of nearly 10 years, and it means a lot to us to unveil it here in Nigeria.
“We weren’t thinking of anywhere else except Nigeria because of the country’s history of tribunal after elections. Being the year of election in the country, we know it is simply the best thing to do to solve the nation’s looming tribunal cases.
“What this new invention would do is that it would save time, cost and resources. Most of all, it would strengthen democracy in the country because only winners would emerge. There would no longer be cases of stolen mandates.”
Mr Butiku added that the his company hopes that once the efficiency of the technology is confirmed, it would be passed into law.
“We are aware that some top politicians in the country are already bracing up for election tribunals. We would like to tell them that they need not to. Our satellites have captured all the scenes of voting, counting, collation and announcement of results across the 36 states and the FCT. All we need do is to replay what happened in the areas of concern and everything would be settled.
“We are therefore calling on all aggrieved candidates in last week’s elections — especially the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party in the presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and the senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Akwa Ibom, Senator Godswill Akpabio — to embrace this technology instead of election tribunal.
“In fact, we are seeking partnership with INEC. We assure them that our new discovery would make the coming gubernatorial elections more transparent, free and fair.”
After the announcement of presidential election results, incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari was declared winner. However, his neck-to-neck rival, Atiku Abubakar of the PDP has vehemently rejected the announcement saying he would “regain his stolen mandate” in court.
A host of senatorial candidates too have declared their plans to seek legal redress after the results announced didn’t favour them.
Nigeria’s presidential election results since 2003 have always been taken to the tribunal, and President-elect Muhammadu Buhari has a track record of this. 2015 was the only year when there was no tribunal for a presidential aspirant that lost an election.
Caveat: This is a work of satire. Names or anything that has semblance with them, persons, wise or otherwise, offices, high or low, authorities, constituted or unconstituted, are as a result mixture of the author’s imagination and inspiration from Above, and any semblance of actual persons, far or near, organizations or body is the handiwork of Mr Coincidence. You have been told. Don’t say we haven’t!"
Fake news is good for the brain — study shows,https://punocracy.com/fake-news-is-good-for-the-brain-study-shows/,2019-03-01T13:58:21+01:00,"In Nigeria today, the campaign against fake news is gaining momentum as different news outlets have begun to set up fact checking platforms to monitor and disavow fake news.
As well, the Nigerian government has described fake news and disinformation as a criminal offence which is punishable by a jail term of 6 years (not yet verified though… can this be an example of fake news?)
Particularly, in this period of elections, several civil societies (who have been known to not always mind their business) as well as individuals who parade themselves as patriotic and well-meaning citizens have condemned the rampant and ‘flippant’ dissemination of fake news tagging it a threat to democracy and peaceful coexistence.
However, a study by Dr. Ajakunle Agbenimi has shown that Fake news, contrary, to different allegations is indeed crucial to cognitive formation and increased mental reasoning.
This is contained in his paper entitled ‘Fake News: Emerging Trends in News Forwarding and Persuasive Politics’ published by the International Journal of Lies, University of Falsehood.
While speaking on his research findings, Dr. Agbenimi dismissed those who condemned fake news, describing them as “comprador intelligentsia” and “pseudo-realists”.
He further said, “the argument that Fake news undermines the peace of a nation is a blatant faux pax. Literally, it doesn’t hold any water. It is an erroneous academic premise founded on illogicality and lack of acute reasoning.”
“Ironically, it shows that those who said so haven’t consumed much fake news themselves. If they have they would have changed their perspective of reasoning because the consumption of fake news in its infinite numbers enhances the multidimensionality and increased capacity of the brain.
“You see, fake news reveal at closer scrutiny the human dynamism, ingenuity and the innate scientific prowess to always proffer verifiable claims as explanations to vague or obscure phenomena.
“For instance, an individual wonders why Donald Trump didn’t endorse any presidential candidate in the Nigerian elections. He/she sees this as an unbelievable natural phenomenon. Hence, equipped with adequate mental apparatus, he/she forges a correlate explanation and solution to the mythic silence of Donald Trump. He creates a statement and puts it in the mouth of the president and says, he endorses A. Atiku or M. Buhari, whichever the muses please.
“How is this different from saying the earth is spherical or that man evolved from apes? The truth is the ontology of fake news is purely scientific.
“Tagging such news ‘fake’ is, therefore, inherently erroneous and devoid of reasoning. It should rather be described as the ‘alternative truth’. Nothing is fake or pseudo in itself.
“The conclusion of my findings is that Fake News (alternative truth) is necessary for improved mental ability which is deteriorating in contemporary world and it is only consumption in large quantity that can aid this and bring it to fruition.
“Fake news is like breast milk. When you lack adequate measure of it, you may not be able to think for yourself but live on the precepts of daily newspapers who tell you what is not when you can think for yourself. You should always recourse to the philosophical proposition of the great René Descartes ‘corgito ergo sum’ translated in English as ‘I think, therefore I am’. It is worthy to note that it is ‘I’ not ‘they’ or ‘the newspapers’,” he concluded.

Smaller parties ask INEC to share void votes equally among them,https://punocracy.com/smaller-parties-ask-inec-to-share-void-votes-equally-among-them/,2019-03-01T09:16:28+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― Lesser-known political parties in Nigeria, on the heels of the presidential and national assembly elections held last Saturday, have urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to redistribute the number of rejected votes equally among them.
This appeal was made on Thursday at a meeting held in Abuja by the Nigerian Association of Small but Mighty Political Parties (NASMPP).
In a press statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, Comrade Sofela Oluwamumudondo, and obtained by The T.A. Report, the parties lamented the embarrassment of “scoring abysmally low in a number of states”.
“We are not asking for anything strange. We all know that in our various schools, lecturers give students additional points if they do not meet the cut-off mark. Why can’t INEC also do this? INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu, being a former lecturer, should understand,” the statement read.
“We ask the electoral commission and Nigerians at large to put themselves in our shoes. How can political parties — not cooperative societies or student associations — be getting zero votes, one vote, in a country of nearly 200 million people? It is highly unfair. And it is also bad for the reputation of this country.
“We were unable to reach a consensus as to what sharing formula INEC should adopt, in preparation for the gubernatorial elections. So we have decided to have the votes shared equally.”
Speaking to our reporter after the meeting, National Chairman of the People’s Coalition Party (PCP), Don Anthony Chukwuma Harmattan, complained about the jokes on the social media targeted against parties such as his.
He said: “Nigerians do not recognise the importance of our parties. They are saying on Twitter that we should be checking our results through JAMB scratch cards. Don’t they know that smaller parties are needed in a democracy to make things lively? Besides, how can Nigerians get the coveted title of ‘former presidential/senatorial candidate’ if there are only two parties? Don’t they know that these parties are like universities, while we are the polytechnics and colleges of education?”
“At the PCP, we are just glad to be the second runner-up in the presidential race, but we believe we can still do better,” he added.
“Our three-man National Executive Council has already gone back to the drawing board to restrategise against 2023 general elections. But we are not sure yet what acronym to adopt: whether PPP or PPD.”
Following the PCP closely in the fourth position is another party with an unknown presidential candidate and a rather suspicious name: the African Democratic Congress (ADC).
Nigeria presently holds a world record for the longest ballot paper ever used in elections in all of history. There are 91 political parties in the country, and73 of thempresented candidates for the presidential race. Others, investigations have revealed, simply auction their loyalty to the highest bidder among the big fish.
The election conducted last Saturday recordedalmost 1.3 millionrejected votes across the country. This is nearly double the total number votes that accrued to all the parties — asides the PDP and APC, which was 869,758.

#NigeriaDecides2019: Why you need to sell your votes,https://punocracy.com/nigeriadecides2019-why-you-need-to-sell-your-votes/,2019-02-22T23:24:46+01:00,"Election days are special days. And special days often come with special offers and surprises. One of such offers which politicians and voters alike are carefully awaiting to give — and take — is vote buying.
Take a breather. I’m aware, as written in the section 124 of the Electoral Act, sellers and buyers of votes are liable, on conviction, to a maximum fine of N500, 000 or 12 months imprisonment,  or both. But then do you think that thatElectoral Actis still to be followed? After all, the president doesn’t even seem to believe in it. Don’t take my word for that. I’m just saying.
After wide consultation and far reaching assessment, here are some of the reasons you may want to consider selling — or as the case maybe, buying — of votes.
First, every 4 year term of a Nigerian politician is a contract. And because study has shown that the surest time to see such politician is usually election and campaign periods, the dividend of such contract can be reaped only during these periods. Infrastructural improvement is also prime during this period.
So, if nothing is sure after the election and campaign periods, isn’t it a smart thing to get whatever one can get when it is available? In other words, every offer of sales or purchase of an electorate’s vote is an advance payment of a 4 years contract. Make hay while the sun is hot.
Let’s do some trivial mathematics. 4 years are equivalent of 1460 days. Assuming N200 is all that you get in exchange for your vote, then for 4 years, it means you have an offer of 14K per day. Fair deal, right?
Mind you, if it is N500 you are paid to sell your conscience, then your daily worth is 34K. Isn’t this too a right price to lift you above the pit of your financial crisis?
Meanwhile, were you to sell your vote for N1,000, then after 4 years, your wage on daily basis would have been 68K. Another big price for the wise, uh?
Perhaps, you are lucky. If the offer you get for your PVC is N5,000, the implication of that is that your daily worth is N3. Possibly by then the charge per text message sent would have been reduced to N3 instead of N4 so that it can worth something for you. Try your luck.
Maybe — just maybe — you are not convinced yet that selling your votes means earning big. Or maybe you feel you worth more.
A selling price of N500, 000 amounts to N342 per day for the next 4 years. Although, this is below a dollar per day, and it is given that you are still within the bracket of the impoverished. But I know poverty makes you look good. It saves you from too many demands that come from kith and kin who would always depend on those who have “small change” for the smallest of things. It is in your own interest to remain poor by receiving the buyout.
How much worth do you place on yourself? 14K? Or 34K? Or 68K? Or N3? Or maybe N342? Vote sellers have big self worth: their worth revolves around these ranges.
Again, if you miss out on this free money, with what mouth would you tell your children that you tried to salvage the future for them? I mean, with what face would you look at them in the eyes and say you tried to recover some loot from the politicians who came to the poll with so much to throw around?
In case you don’t know, know that by the time 1000 of you get N5000 each, even though the politician stole N5 billion, at the end of the day you’ve been able to recover N5 million (0.1%) of the loot. Nice return, right?
Perhaps, the 5,000 you got has so much market value that you can feed with it all year long — and still have some savings — I wouldn’t know. Or maybe the economy, under the watch of your looter friend, is so robust that any Nigerian can leave happily by earning 5K in 4 years, I can’t say.
Or maybe the land is so secure that the Nigerian police are complaining of losing their jobs because there are no more criminals to catch. Or maybe Sambisa has become one of the safest place in this slice of the global map. Whichever way it is you don’t have to bother yourself. Get the money first and make these other things secondary. Only the wise would do otherwise.
So, good people, sell your vote, and show the world that you’re not worth more than a few kobo. If you don’t sell it, tell me, what do you gain? Be wise."
‘How do we survive for four years if we don’t sell our votes?!’,https://punocracy.com/how-do-we-survive-for-four-years-if-we-dont-sell-our-votes/,2019-02-22T21:44:37+01:00,"By: Launko Ajanlekoko
“We have heard all your talks and your admonitions on not selling our votes to ‘greedy’ politicians but how do we survive for four years if we don’t sell our votes? Will you feed us?”
This was the question of a furious tall black lady who had her infant strapped at her back and five other children clustering around her during a day event organised by the International Centre for Ethical and Moral Relations (ICEMR) themed ‘citizen’s engagement in achieving electoral sanctity’.
The lady seemingly infuriated by the speech of the speaker who spoke on ‘Votes Buying and Electoral Corruption’ raised her hands immediately the speaker said “selling your vote doesn’t alleviate your poverty, it rather makes you poorer, mentally and financially”.
“You come in droves every four years and tell us not to sell our votes. That it is corruption. That it is morally depraving. And this and that. Yet you offer us nothing than your saliva and sweats!” she exclaimed after she was flagged on to talk by the speaker.
“Need I remind you that the politicians also come every four years and give us what they give us and it is on that that we live and survive,” she added.
“You see for my family, it is tradition. My husband is not here because he has gone to collect the PVCs of those that don’t intend to go out and vote. We have prospective buyers who will buy and vote on their behalf.
“If not that we sell our votes and help others that are willing too only God knows where we will be by now!
“Take for instance, the last time we had an election. My family was given two bags full of Kuli Kuli and Garri to Vote for Party A. On the election day, party B offered us a cylinder full of groundnut and some bags of Garri. That is what we have been eating for the past 4 years. And it only finished just yesterday, this yesterday.
“Tomorrow, I hear that Party B intends to give 5,000 and Party A 4000! My husband is working for party A and I am working for Party B. You know what that means double double!
“Let us do some analysis. Take for instance my husband is given 5000 and he brings it home. We have 1460 days in 4 years. 5000naira divided by 1460 days means we have a whooping sum of 3naira to be spent per day!
“And we are not taking any chances this year, my children— you see that one 9, this 8, this 7, and this one 6 have all be registered for PVC so they will be having their share of the thousand tomorrow. You know what that means, you know?
“Now you tell us not to sell our votes, how do you expect us to survive?” she concluded while the other women like her in the room kept jeering."
"Prayer points will now count as votes, INEC tells voters who won’t come out to vote",https://punocracy.com/payer-points-will-now-count-as-votes-inec-tells-voters-who-wont-come-out-to-vote/,2019-02-21T23:26:42+01:00,"ABUJA —In case you have the plan to stay at home in the coming elections without voting, then you just got a boost because, other things than votes casted would now count in determining the winners of the election.
In order to run an all-inclusive electioneering system, where everyone, irrespective of religion, race, political belief, gender or age, prayer points have been said to also count in vote counting.
This latest development was made known by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakub, while briefing newsmen Thursday on the readiness of the Commission in Abuja, ahead of the Feb 23 polls.
Mr Mahmood expressed his optimism on the move, saying it was  made to makeup for the possibility of low voters turnout.
“We are glad to inform electorates who wouldn’t want to vote but would rather pray for a good leader that their prayers have been answered,” Mahmood said.
“Let them continue praying. We are happy to tell them that, we would, henceforth, count their prayer points to determine winners of this weekend’s and subsequent elections.
“Because we don’t want anyone to be disenfranchised that is why we are considering these set of people. Let them vote with their mouths while others vote with their thumbs. It is only a matter of choice.”
Speaking with Mr Alao Abiodun, a professor ofPrayersitology, on what this announcement portends, he opined that the new development would give a voice to those who don’t like to vote but wants a particular candidate to win.
He applauded the initiative without sparing the smartness of the electorate who would adopt the initiative.
“It’s a beautiful development which needs absolute commendation. The Nigerian electorates are diverse set of people; so, giving a voice to those who chose to vote with their mouths means our democracy is ripening
“As it stands, it is a plus for those who believe in‘By God’s grace, lágbájá will win the election’or‘In Jesus name, tàmèdùn will win’but would never vote. I commend the wisdom of these people. Such is rare. It is not found everywhere. May the Lord increase their wisdom
“By the time their prayer points are counted, they would have formed the largest bulk of voters the nation has. After all, prayers are what have made the great countries of the world great. I remember, I read somewhere that a nation’s praying power determines its economic prosperity.
“So I think, come Saturday, it is safe to tell those that would stay at home, praying for the best candidate to win rather than vote their preferred candidate, that the Lord has answered their prayers!
“With people like them, Nigeria would move forward, and we will not have to bother about ballot snatching or electoral malpractices. Nobody will shot too!”
Mr Alao also argued that, since Nigeria can arguably pride herself as the seat of the highest number of churches and mosques in the world, it is in the best to serve the interest of the goers to these places.

"INVESTIGATION: How APC, PDP “rent crowd” to fill up campaign venues",https://punocracy.com/investigation-how-apc-pdp-rent-crowd-to-fill-up-campaign-venues/,2019-02-12T11:51:16+01:00,"The huge turnout of crowd in the recent campaigns by
Nigeria’s major political parties is part of the deal struck with a mobilization
company, this newspaper can authoritatively report.
Disguising like a potential client for weeks, Trisha Mainama, the spokesperson of People Mobilization Limited, a mobilization company renowned for “renting crowd”, disclosed this to this newspaper in an exclusive interview with him.
The company also called for more patronage, especially
for the governorship elections and beyond.
“Our job is to mobilize, and we use our professional trainings to ensure that this is done beautifully. Did you see the Kano crowd of the APC and the PDP? We are good at what we do. Try us.
“We have offices in states nationwide and we have links to the Royal fathers, community leaders and the landlord association members in all the states of the federation, including the FCT. So, mobilizing people from the grassroots is quite easy for us.
“There are times this is not enough. So we partner
with neighbouring countries to get people from them. You remember the governors
from Niger Republic who were at the APC rally in Kano? We did it,” he boasted.
He further explained that it is part of their job to
give tips to attendees who might have not eaten anything all day but would
still risk being under the scorching sun to “Sai baba” or be “atikulated”.
“Our major client, especially in this season of politicking, is APC and PDP. We can’t joke with them. You know, the more the crowd they pull, the louder the message of popularity they tend to send. That is why we deliver, always. Our result is what speaks for us, oga.
“Of course, you have to give tips to these locals to make them turnout even when they have reasons not to. We consider this when we charge our customers. This is why our charges may seem high
Although, he did not state the exact amount charged to mobilize crowd, he hinted that the “amount depends on the client, the purpose of the mobilization and the hugeness of the crowd intended.”
“Our charges vary. It all depends on the package you pay for. A price is fixed ones we know the population you wish to pull, and the time frame also matters. How educated the people in the community from which you want us to mobilize from is also a factor we consider.
A 2018 report by Democracy for All in Nigeria (DAN) shows that massive turnout for rally doesn’t correlate with massive turnout for vote. Also, the report adds, the crowd generated by a political party in a state does not suggest such party would get as much votes in such state. In fact, the report reads, they may not eventually get a five-digit number of votes “as past elections have shown”.
Although it is unclear why political parties “hire
crowd” to attend campaign rally, a political engineer, Atiku Buhari, suggested
that it is all a psychological jab which politicians throw at each other.
According to him, politicians target huge crowd to
have psychological effects on the people and their opponents. “Also,” he told
us, “if in the end they lose by a wide margin in the said state, they can
easily say the state was rigged, and make reference to their rally where they pulled
large number of supporters.
“When you pull huge crowd, chances are that some people would follow the crowd at the polls. It is more of a psychological strategy. And you know, voters tend to vote for the person that seems more powerful, people who can pull the largest crowd; so that, as they call it, they won’t waste their votes.”
Independent investigation by this newspaper shows that persons who attend an APC rally are almost as certain to attend a PDP rally.
A classic example is Salimatu Umar who was seen putting on an APC customized shirt and a PDP customized wrapper. She said her mission was to get more souvenirs and “see the big men [top political leaders in the country] for the first time”.
“I don’t think it matters. What I’m wearing is what I
have. If I stay at home, how will I get more? At least the next time I’d have
this opportunity is in 4 years’ time. Let me get what I can get now.”
According to our investigation, 30 per cent of the people interviewed don’t have a PVC, and 20% are not sure they will vote. 10 per cent said they won’t vote at all. Only 50 per cent have the plan to vote.
Of this 50 per cent, 20 per cent said they would vote another party different from the party whose rally they attended.

Nigeria’s potholes experience calculated massacre as election season approaches,https://punocracy.com/nigerias-potholes-experience-calculated-massacre-as-election-season-approaches/,2019-02-12T07:05:21+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)― In what has been fondly described as an ‘electoral miracle’, potholes in Nigeria have recently been observed to decline massively as citizens ready themselves for the poll this weekend.
According to a recent report made available to the public by the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency, there has been a sharp spike not just in road repair and construction all over the country, but in infrastructural works generally.
In a phone interview with this online paper, the agency’s Managing Director, Engr. Nurudeen Abdurahaman Rafindadi, described this occurrence as “strange but not totally unexpected”. He explained that, every four years, some weeks to the election period, it is usually rainy season for contractors and officials of works ministries in most states of the country.
“On a light note,” he added, “we should even amend the constitution so that elections are conducted every year. That way, we can be sure government will always pay contractors and be on their necks to make certain they deliver.”
Haleem Olorunnisola, founder and national coordinator of the E Go Better Movement, has however tagged the occurrence as “largely fraudulent and illusory”.
“Nigerians should not be fooled by the sight of heavy machinery on their roads and the superficial revisiting of abandoned projects across the country,” said Olorunnisola, who prides himself as having a PhD in Bullshitronomy.
He added: “Though it is true that some projects will get completed and some will be started, we will no doubt return to the status quo a day after election. It is the unwritten law of Politics Nigeriana.
“We should also be mindful of the damage this kind of attitude may cause to our roads and public welfare, as governments most times only succeed in leaving them worse than they found them.
“Besides, it is not all governments that are truly working. Some cough out money they’ve been claiming does not exist to make it happen. Some borrow money from banks. But we have also heard of state governors who simply rent the equipment for public display, only to be returned to the owners after the elections. Others even make use of dead transformers installed in strategic places just to lure people into thinking they are working.”
Though the rising level of infrastructural development or seeming development is a national phenomenon, The T.A. Report gathers that Lagos State is an exception. It is reported that capital-intensive projects in the Centre of Excellence currently suffer unusual neglect as the governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has abandoned office for a more pragmatic role of “APC campaign rally strategist and bench-warmer”.

Giant Abuja broom wins Guinness World Record for ‘stupidest campaign object’,https://punocracy.com/giant-abuja-broom-wins-guinness-world-record-for-stupidest-campaign-object/,2019-02-10T23:10:04+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) ―Nigeria’s ruling political party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, has just bagged the prestigious Guinness award for inventing the “stupidest campaign object in the world” known to mankind.
The object which was entered for the award by the party ahead of the 2019 general elections is a giant broom-like sculpture erected at the Abuja city gate, in the country’s Federal Capital Territory.
A spokesman for the Guinness Book of Records confirmed this in a release obtained by The T.A. Report on Sunday, describing the art as “remarkably stupid, totally lacking in imagination” and “the most laughable piece of campaign material we have ever seen”.
“When we received the application, we got to work by comparing the structure to all others available in reports from Ancient Greece to modern times, from communist regimes to democratic nations,” said the release.
“We discovered immediately that this one is matchless in its absurdity. It takes a lot of sacrifice and intellectual self-restraint to make something like this possible and we commend that,” it continued.
“We would normally expect that it takes decades before this record is broken in another political campaign. But, with the level of passionate competitiveness observable in Nigeria’s politics, we suppose anything really is possible. Giant squirrels, chickens, trees, and so on… you never can tell.”
Information Minister Lai Mohammed, reacting to the announcement, said it is a great honour for the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and an affirmation “that we are now respected by the international community”.
“No other government or political party has brought fame to the country in this manner through its extraordinary ingenuity. The broom represents how we intend to have sweeping victory from the centre to all the crannies of the country,” he said.
“It goes to show also that the APC is serious not just about maintaining its hold at the capital territory but in the world at large.”
Meanwhile, the campaign spokesperson for the People’s Democratic Party candidate, Phrank Shaibu, responding to the APC’s challenge to build a similar structure, has said they do not need to compete in the erection of three-dimensional party emblems.
“For us, it is not size that matters or how intimidating an erection is,” he said, “but how long a man can last on the battlefield. That is the ultimate question, fellow Nigerians.”
“Besides, we do not need to start wasting money on new structures when giant umbrellas already litter the thirty six states of the country, as well as the Federal Capital Territory — thanks mostly to our call card sellers and small-scale enterprises,” he added.

Why campaign rallies are the best thing after Agege bread,https://punocracy.com/why-campaign-rallies-are-the-best-thing-after-agege-bread/,2019-02-03T23:30:09+01:00,"Let us grab a moment to thank the Almighty for one blessing we often take for granted, shall we? Perhaps because it happens so regularly and predictably, we tend to savour its many flavours without as much as showing the slightest appreciation. Shameful! As we presently find ourselves again in that season of full political bloom, I recommend that we seize this time to reflect, and recognise how much campaign rallies have done for us as a nation. And how miserable our lives would be without them.
For a couple of weeks, every four years, Nigerians are given a rare opportunity to roll with the political elites and overlords. Never mind that, at times, some take it too far by rolling on the floor as a show of loyalty… in essence making themselves roll models before their role models. Never mind that. This once-in-a-lifetime privilege — or a maximum of ten, considering our life expectancy rate — deserves to be seen for what it really is: a piece of good fortune. Jah be praised!
It is during campaign rallies that the gods and goddesses of politics descend from the cloudy skies of governance (and other serious stuff) to reunite with the poor masses. Again, it is at this blessed period we witness a get-together between the political rooftops and the political grassroots. As we all know, they hardly have time any other day as they are too busy building refineries, repairing roads, and fixing the country’s countless problems.
About two weeks ago, the Senate even had to adjourn its plenary over an inability to form a quorum. News had it thatonly ninelawmakers showed up to the chamber. Of course, we know where the other one hundred were: one campaign meeting, rally or the other — except Uncle Dino Melaye, who appears to still be under police custody.
This only goes to show how significant these rallies have become in our lives, transcending mere politics to the very core of what binds together the two tribes in the country: the have’s and the have not’s.
We should be particularly thankful during this electioneering season because ofzakind of leaderzaAlmighty has blessed us with. He is so busy shadowboxing corruption and pleading with America to return our money, that he forgets to connect with the people. Or even local media houses. Research in fact shows that President Buhari has spent more time in a plane than he has on the ground with the common people of Nigeria. Which is why we should thank the good Lord for blessing us with elections and the campaign rallies that conventionally come with them. If not for them, we might even still be speculating on whether our commander-in-chief still lives.
Baba has got so used to relating with foreigners that he felt if he could not take a campaign rally to ‘Niger’, he would at least bring ‘Niger’ to a campaign rally here in Nigeria.
Campaign rallies have, over the years, also been a source of free entertainment. ‘Free’ is an understatement even since you might even get paid (and also one or two souvenirs) for attending. At these events, we experience stand-up comedy from an usual set of humourists. Don’t get it wrong, it is not as if they do not humour us every other day; but during these rallies, our dear politicians take turns on a stage to treat us to unending amusement.
There is nothing the pot-bellied politician would not do to convince the commoner that he is part of his everyday realities. He would sing all kinds of songs, speak all kinds of tongues, pray in the name of all kinds of gods, and dance, in a most awkward manner, all kinds of moves — especially the latest in town. All this time, we the people, the spectators on these days and all others, get freely entertained.
The only catch is that, if you are not watching from a television screen, you are probably laughing your ass off as the Sun consistently flogs you like a drunk Eyo masquerade.
What have we not seen this year in the name of electoral campaigns? We have seen the president of Nigeria paid rare visits to the five-percenters of the SouthEast. We have seen Professor Osinbajo call Godswill Akpabio and Baba calling Abdullahi Ganduje the sweetest of names, deserved only by the Saints of old. We have seen a president risk his life, in a game of puppetry, to please God knows who. We have seen the vice president emerge from a helicopter crash like Steven Seagal, just because… you know… there’s unfinished business in the Next Level.
We have seen the governor of one of the world’s fastest growing cities attach himself to campaign trains, while his state’s budget gathers dust on his desk miles away. Oh! And we have seen politicians dance to the trending Ghanaian Malwedhe dance (also known as collapsing dance) — unintentionally we should add.
You have to admit that this level of political drama is worthy of a Netflix acquisition. And it comes only once every four years with the campaign period. So, dear friends, let us order for some popcorn and bottles of chilledkunuas we anticipate what the few days left to general elections have in stock. We might need some throat lozenges too to ease the aching as we roll in the aisles.
Happy elections in advance!"
How Kano will deliver 5 million votes to Buhari — Ganduje,https://punocracy.com/how-kano-will-deliver-5-million-votes-to-buhari-ganduje/,2019-02-03T14:37:35+01:00,"Kano —Perhaps to shut the moving lips of doubters and members of the opposition party, the governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Ganduje, has revealed how he will deliver 5 million votes from Kano to President Muhammadu Buhari come February 16.
“We have done it before; we will do it again,” his smile was wide and his red cap glowed under the noon sun.
Speaking before a sea of supporters on Sunday, the “governortorial” candidate of Kano APC advised the crowd to handle the words of doubters like a pinch of salt.
“I’m aware there are doubters on how fetching President Muhammadu Buhari 5 million votes is possible. But let me tell you, dear people, impossibility is not in my dictionary.
“Minus our cows, we have the highest human population in Nigeria. No one doubts that. Lagos is only using politics.
“But now, it is time to use our number to our advantage; we will also use politics. The 5 million electorates in Kano this Febuhari (sic) will be all about Buhari,” the governor added to the roar of his large audience.
He paused to allow the noise of “Sai Baba! Sai Buhari! Sai Baba! Sai Buhari!” to die down before he continued.
“Last election we had over a million votes, and almost a million void, you remember? Good. We plan to make the void votes count this time around. Voters lesson has been part of our curriculum from primary to tertiary school, and there are Voters Learning Centres in every locality in Kano. We will improve our real school curriculum later. Election is important at this point.”
Apparently to quickly answer the curious minds, the governor spoke further: “You may be wondering why primary school? Or even secondary school?
“You see, this is where politics comes in. I don’t believe in underage. These are the leaders of tomorrow; why shouldn’t they choose their leaders of today? Does government policies affect only adults? After all, they have PVC too.
“By our permutations, with these plans, we are sure we could boast of 4 million votes. But our target is 5 million. Here is our we would reach that mark:
“We have supporters from Niger Republic. I don’t think anyone doubts this. Issa Moussa of Zinder and Zakiri Umar of Maradi were at our campaign rally on Thursday. They are our very good partners. They will mobilize people for us. Nigeria and Niger there is no much difference. We are brothers. Those are our plans.”
The governor, who is in the eye of public outcry following a leaked video where he was caught pocketing huge bale of money in his agbada which had been sewn to fit the purpose, is, like Buhari, also seeking a second term as the state’s governor.
However, the criminal allegations hasn’t been given a life because “the president doesn’t seem to trust the technology that was used to ‘tame’ the governor.”
But Yesterday’s Today understands that the president’s prosecution of the head of such stronghold, Kano, would mean handing his best ground for large votes to the opposition.
In fact, a source close to the governor told us the governor is not bothered about the outcry as he is sure “no prosecution fashioned against him can prosper”.
“All of them are making noise about Gandollar up and down. I just laugh,” our source said the governor said.
“After 5 million votes, you think the president will have enough balls to probe me?
“Kai…Wallahi…You don’t prosecute the person that brings you to power. It doesn’t happen anywhere in the world that your reward for helping someone into power is jail. Never.
“This was the same thing that happened between James Ibori and President Musa Yaradua. You don’t probe people that bring you to power. That’s how it works. Mine won’t be the last.”
Truth to his words, this account on James Ibori, former Delta state governor, is well documented in Olusegun Adeniyi’s Power, Politics and Death: A front-row account of Nigeria under the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua.

Enjoy!
The ‘Molue’ is the omnibus farting fumes and pain on Lagos roads. It symbolises the innumerable privately-owned commercial buses seating 44 passengers with an indeterminable number of standing passengers cramming the aisle. The ‘Molue’ is akin to the spider; lethal, loose-limbed and loaded. The queer-looking thingamajig came into existence in the 1970s. ‘Molue’ is a Yoruba interpretation of ‘mould it’, which refers to the forging of iron sheets and steel by local auto builders to make the crudest bus known to science and technology.
Exhibiting the nimbleness of a lithe athlete, Jimoh, the stocky bus conductor jumped off the cruising giant cage on wheel, outrunning the rickety, jalopy, smoky bucket of bolts. As he jumped off the step at the door and the bus screeched to a stop at Iyana Ipaja, Jimoh began to shout the route of the bus, “Oshodi! Oshodi! Oshodi! Oshodi N100! Wole pelu shenji e ni o, mi o ni shenji o. Ikeja ma wole o. (enter with your shenji o, I don’t have shenji o, Ikeja passengers, don’t enter o)”
Passengers bolted after the bus like male monkeys on heat chasing after females to unleash testosterone. Some passengers dived in through the door, some jumped in through the window, some got in through the driver’s doorless compartment; gaining entry into the ‘Molue’ is much more difficult than the Power Holding Company of Nigeria providing electricity for 30 minutes nonstop. And the driver never stopped revving the disgruntled engine under the ugly hood of the dirty yellow bus. Black fume filtered in through the cracks in the bus floor with the road underneath glaring back, and a tough-looking tout issued a crumpled ticket to Jimoh, snapping N200 from his unwilling hands.
“Adealu, Araromi, Iyana Dopemu, Abe Bridge, Cement, Mangoro, Ile Zik, Ikeja, Airport, PWD, Shogunle, Ladipo, Alasia, Bolade. Go on to Oshodi, oga mi,” the bare-chested, sweaty conductor grunted as he tried to force his way through the cramped mass of standing passengers, collecting his fare. As if fleeing from certain demons, the bus bolted out of Iyana Ipaja Under Bridge and fled past Adealu, Araromi and Iyana Dopemu bus stops, only for it to succumb to a gnarling traffic jam starting from Abe Bridge. “Ah, go-slow yi bad o. Look at the endless queue, when are we getting out of this?” Kunle, the ‘Molue’ driver asked in regret.
Jimoh retorted, “Oga mi, go-slow on this road has been existing before I was born; government has found no solution to it. No be today o.”
“Do we even have a government in this country?”, queried an elderly woman in iro and buba, adding, “The common man on the street doesn’t feel the impact of government; there’s hunger in the land, herdsmen are killing, nowhere is safe, yet what all of them are concerned with is getting power.”
“Stop pressing your groin against me this early Monday morning, conductor; I’m not your type,” yelled a beautiful lady who was standing by the door of the bus.
“Na wetin? You fine pass Croatian President wey dey hug everybody for stadium? That na a whole president o. You wey no be president, person just rest on you small, you dey shout. Me, I wan go Croatia, jo! I wan leave this ‘Molue’ job go dey hug fine president. If that president hug me, I no go gree am go o. Na so I go glue am like person wey electric shock,” Jimoh said.
“Is it your type that the Croatian president would hug,” hissed the beautiful lady.
“Pogba wey she hug fine pass me?” Jimoh retorted while the lady responded with a long hiss, and a curse, “Wretched fellow!”
“Oga driver, please, can you tune your radio to Lasgidis FM? There’s a debating competition being aired live. Please, let’s listen to it” the elderly woman pleaded.
“Are you a teacher, ma?” the driver asked the woman seated behind him as he looked at her in the mirror above his head.
“Yes, sir,” the woman said with a sarcastic undertone.
“I was enjoying that Wasiu Ayinde live play o, but I will tune the radio to Lasgidi FM because I have respect for elders, especially women. I’m not like this tout of a conductor called Jimoh. He didn’t go to school, that’s why he ended up as a conductor,” the driver said.
The voice of the debate moderator came on air.
Moderator:Ladies and gentlemen, you’re, once again, welcome to the final of the annual national debating competition. As you all know, secondary schools from each of the 36 states of the federation started this long race. Today, we have just two schools in the final. The road to the final was nothing but easy! Salvation High School, Lagos, and Redemption Charismatic Comprehensive College of Port Harcourt are slugging it out to decide who will be the 2018 winner of this prestigious competition. The topic of the debate is: “Do Nigerian leaders deserve the Jerry Rawlings treatment?”
Audience:(Round of applause)
Moderator:I, hereby, call on the Supporting Speaker of Salvation Boys High School, Funbi Ajisoge, to come out for the final three minutes to marshal his points before the judges.
Omotolani:Good morning, Mr Chairman, the distinguished panel of judges, the accurate timekeeper, fellow debaters and members of the audience. I come before you this morning to convince you on why Nigerian leaders deserve the Rawlings treatment. What is the Rawlings treatment? Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings was a military leader of neighbouring Ghana, who in 1979, executed three former Ghanaian heads of state, three Supreme Court justices, several army generals and leaders, in what was described as a “house-cleaning exercise” aimed at stamping out corruption in the country. This is what we need in Nigeria to stem the high level of corruption in a country, where elected officials are no longer responsible to the electorate. A consideration of some of the speeches made by some of our leaders would properly situate the aridity of their thoughts, and show why this country is endangered. Nigerians have neither forgotten the thoughtless statement, “Nigerian youths are lazy,” nor this stupid speech by a serving senator, “I will kill myself and put you (policemen) in trouble,” nor this one by a megalomaniac ex-president, “Election is a do-or-die affair,” nor the shocking speech, “Stealing is not corruption.” We also have “Igbos should go and jump into the lagoon,” and the lie of the millennium by a serving minister and former governor of a Niger Delta state, who said, “God knows that I don’t like money. I have never collected bribe in my life,” and this bombshell from a former First Lady, “Ojukwu is a great man, he died but his manhood lives on,” and the latest chartbuster, “I’m in paaaaiiinnn, (huuhuu). If anything should happen to me…”
What do you expect from a country whose leaders don’t have the fertility of mind to make moving speeches such as the ones made by Martin Luther King, President Barack Obama, Nelson Mandela, Winston Churchill, J. F. Kennedy, Mahatma Gandhi, etc? How can such a country be developed?
The bell goes.
Omotolani:“I hope I’ve been able to convince you, and not confuse you, with these few points of mine that Nigerian leaders deserve the Rawlings treatment, thank you.
Moderator:Yes, the die is cast! The chief speakers and supporting speakers have all laid their points bare before the judges, who are now doing the additions and subtractions. While they are at that, I must say we’ve been treated to an exhilarating battle of intelligence here this morning. I hope you all enjoyed the oratorical skills displayed by each of the four speakers. While we await the verdict of the judges, I’ll call for a musical interlude…"
THROWBACK: How to celebrate in dependence│Elnathan John,https://punocracy.com/throwback-how-to-celebrate-in-dependence-%e2%80%95-by-elnathan-john/,2019-02-03T05:59:26+01:00,"This piecefirst appeared on Blogspoton 1st of October, 2017, and was authored by lawyer, author and amazing satirist: Elnathan John. Enjoy!
Darling Buhari,
Before we entered a relationship, before we fell in love and you promised to Change my life, I used to give thanks every In-dependence day to all the people who make our home the amazing place that it is. This In-dependence day, the only person I really feel like thanking is you, for being the most loving president ever, for always being there, for taking care of our enemies, for solving all of our problems, for bringing about real Change, for being so flexible and kind, for being a great communicator and listener, for being dependable.
But you know, I still think we should thank the other people who assist you and our great country in being the amazing place that it is. Some of them I have done before, but one can never be too grateful. Find below suggestions on who you should send a message to this in-dependence day.
My dear, I think we should begin by thanking the United Kingdom. For keeping you safe. For helping you recover. For always being there when you need a doctor, a hospital, when you needed some rest, when you needed to park a plane and when nosy Nigerians decided it was their business what exactly you were spending money treating.
We should also thank them for keeping some of our key projects afloat. For DFID without which some of our hospitals (yes, the ones who can’t even treat you) would crash. For the projects which provide decent employment for our consultants and Phds and other development hustlers. For the schools which make sure your children can take over from you when you decide to retire. For not giving up on us the way they gave up on Europe. For hanging out with us even though they are going through a bad break up. Breakups are hard.
We should also thank America, my dear. For supporting you. For helping you even though these days they don’t agree with your definition of who a terror group is (I believe we can eventually convince them to hate those we hate). Darling, importantly we must thank them for that accent that our radio presenters across the country try so desperately to copy. Our cool radio stations would be dead without those grating, rolling Rs in words like ‘lord’ or even ‘god’. Don’t ask me how some manage to sneak an r into ‘god’. You know how god works in mysterious ways.
So, dear I know you don’t drink alcohol. But you are a tolerant person and allow people to be who they want to be. I know the Shiite massacre is just an exception because this is not who you really are. Sometimes mistakes happen and hundreds of people die. Like that time our pilots killed those IDPs. But back to gratitude. I was saying that you don’t drink alcohol but we should thank the country that gives our alcohol drinkers a sense of purpose. Many Nigerians may not realize Star Lager is a Dutch product, but they help some of our people effectively wash away their sorrows. So we must thank The Netherlands for providing this great product. Ps. We must also pray for our people to stop drinking. This is important.
We must remember to thank South Africa. For all the companies that make our lives bearable. For DSTV. For Shoprite. For MTN which teaches us values like patience and knowing how to have a backup plan. For being a big brother who disciplines the children of his younger brother from time to time (some people call it xenophobia but don’t mind them please).
We must thank Switzerland. For consistently and safely storing money stolen from our country which keeps coming in handy and which helped us through this past recession. Such an amazing country with a big, non-judgmental heart.
We must thank Dubai. For providing an alternative to some of our citizens who would be arrested if they travelled to the US.
We must thank Germany (You remember West Germany? Yes that country). For Julius Berger. Without whom, in the event of an emergency, we would be in serious trouble.
Other countries to thank include Ghana, Cyprus, Ukraine, Malaysia, you know, for providing our middle-class with an opportunity to give their children a decent education.
I also think you should not forget Benin Republic. For all the cooks who keep the expatriates in Nigeria nourished while they provide us technical expertise and foreign aid.
My dear, we owe China a big thank you. For the shinier, cheaper versions of all the things most of our people cannot afford. For the second-hand trains. I know we are paying for it somehow, but still, we must thank them. I know America sometimes whispers into our ear not to get in bed with them too often, but at least they are honest. They don’t lie to us about wanting to marry us or be our best friend.
Important non-state actors to thank include English football in general and the UEFA Champions League. For providing a distraction for young Nigerians who would otherwise have been in the streets being disloyal to you and asking you to fulfil all the promises you made in 2015. For the trends on Twitter on the weekends which gives us plenty to talk about. People don’t realise how football has contributed to our stability as a nation: we spend time fighting over Arsenal and Manchester United or whether Ronaldo is better than Messi instead of fighting each other. God bless them.
You must also thank foreign journalists who make it easy for you to express yourself. They make you overcome your shyness in speaking to the nation. We must thank them for knowing where to ask you questions and how.
Let us thank Chatham House, where politicians who feel uncomfortable mixing with the natives can  travel to and safely express their political thoughts before the colonial masters who always appreciate it. Somehow it trickles down to the natives. Thank god for the internet and tv.
Can we also thank Jacob Zuma? For making you look amazing? Imagine if we had a country in Africa which was not only giving our economy a run for its money but also had a decent president who could read full sentences? Too much pressure. We need more people like him. More state captures.
Let me stop here my dear.
Ps.Maybe we can send a note of gratitude to the Shiites, who have not reacted violently even with how we killed Zakzaky’s children and followers? So calm, those people. Can we just try to release the man and his wife? To show gratitude?
Yours till 2023 and forever,Elnathan John

"The plan was to invite Nigerian, not Nigerien, governors —  aide",https://punocracy.com/the-plan-was-to-invite-nigerian-not-nigerien-governors-aide/,2019-02-03T05:32:40+01:00,"KANO (The T.A. Report) ―The presence of two governors from Niger Republic was actually an embarrassing mistake of phonetics, an aide to the president has told The T.A. Report.
The senior official, who pleaded for his identity not to be disclosed for fear of “being fed to the EFCC like Babachir for political gains”, said the official explanation that they came to understudy President Muhammadu Buhari’s style was mere damage control.
“We were not expecting the governors, Issa Moussa of Zinder and Zakiri Umar of Maradi, at all. It was a surprise, but we had to play along,” he said.
“It was when they showed us genuine letters of invitation from the statehouse that we realised the silly mistake. Baba had given an instruction to an employee at the Office of the Secretary General of the Federation, and perhaps that one thought he said ‘Nigerien’ instead of ‘Nigerian’ governors.
“So as the error not to be like another ‘West Germany’ situation, Garba Shehu suggested we come up with a different theory, which is what is now in circulation.”
“There is really no cause for alarm,” he added. “Baba does not need mercenaries to win the election. Nigerian voters are nearly as desperate and gullible as their Nigerien counterparts anyway. We’ll do just fine without foreign support.”

‘How would students come for our rallies if we called off ASUU strike?’ Buhari asks,https://punocracy.com/how-would-students-come-for-our-rallies-if-we-called-off-asuu-strike-buhari-asks/,2019-02-02T09:03:41+01:00,"KANO (The T.A. Report) ―President Muhammadu Buhari has finally thrown some light on why the industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities may not end anytime soon.
On Thursday, while addressing a mammoth, allegedly multinational, crowd of fans and supporters during the ruling party’s campaign rally in Kano, the 76-year-old Nigerian leader explained the wisdom behind protracting the strike.
“Many people have been asking how soon we plan to resolve this issue with the lecturers. But, please join me in asking them: Are we going to have this number of people here today if not for the strike?” the president asked.
“Wallahi, we cannot,” he replied himself. “So, to answer the question, we will give the university people what they want after our last campaign rally on February 14.”
“It will be our valentine’s gift to them,” he added with a broad smile.
“We would have done something about it in December, but my short friend wisely advised against it,” he said, wrapping his arms around Adams Oshiomole. “He said we should hold on for a while so that our dear students, who have half of all the Voters’ Cards in this country, can join us in this rare reunion of people and politicians.”
Buhari also described the strike as one of the proud achievements of his administration, arguing that it demonstrates how democratic his government is.
“Academic freedom is a priority for this party,” he remarked, “and there is no better way to express this freedom than to down tools without consequences. You know, just as the freedom to marry is best expressed in the right to divorce and re-marry.
“So we urge members of ASUU to be patient with us; and also our l-l-aa- …., sorry, hardworking youth. If we still have enough money left in the treasury after the campaigns, we will definitely give priority to the schools.”
The ASUU strike started on Monday, November 5, 2018, and series of meetings between union officials and the federal government have curiously all ended in deadlocks.
Analysts estimate that, since independence, the average Nigerian student spends more leisure time due to constant strikes than a Lagosian spends in traffic jams his entire life. Academic sessions that are completed successfully without disruptions have, in fact, been observed to trigger panic disorders and depression in students.
“In extreme cases, they are so astonished that they begin to doubt everything, including their very existence,” experts say.

"We have two and a half, not three, arms of government—Nigeria’s AGF clarifies",https://punocracy.com/we-have-two-and-a-half-not-three-arms-of-government/,2019-01-29T19:01:58+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) ―Nigeria’s Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has shed light on the true nature of the country’s political system and structure of government.
During a meeting with journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, he explained that Nigeria runs two and a half arms of government, not three as is commonly alleged. This clarification, he added, “is necessary in the light of recent agitations about reforms taking place in the judiciary”.
“The attention of the Ministry of Justice has been drawn to unfounded claims circulated in the media and on the internet about the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary,” the Minister said.
“We wish to urge the good people of Nigeria to discard these claims as they are nothing but fake news from the pits of hell, fabricated to dent the image of this administration.
“If you carefully trace the legal history of this country, you will realise that the judiciary is not an entire arm of government. At best, we can say it constitutes half of an arm. You will agree that even human beings cannot function well if they have three fully grown arms.”
When a journalist from Sub-Saharan Reporters quoted provisions of sections 6 and 17 of the1999 Constitutionin substantiating the independence and powers of the judiciary, Malami replied that the law has not been signed by the president.
“I am sorry but the administration does not recognise this law you speak of,” said the minister who, reports say, graduated from the Ugandan Law School before proceeding to Nigeria to practise.
“Any law that is in force has to first be reviewed and signed by the president. That’s how it works; and the National Assembly has yet to transmit this so-called 1999 Constitution. For now, Mr President is applying the set of laws he used as head of state in the 1980s, at least pending the time the lawmakers send an update,” he added.
“As important as it is, even the Disability Rights Bill was just signed last week. We cannot jump these procedures.”
Walter Onnoghen was removed as the Chief Justice of Nigeria on Friday. Justifying this act in a speech delivered at the swearing-in of the Acting CJN, President Muhammadu Buhari accused Onnoghen of supervising the acquittal of corrupt public officials arraigned before the Supreme Court.
Critics say it appears the president might have mistaken the Supreme Court for a department under the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.

How not to win elections in Nigeria—for dummies,https://punocracy.com/how-not-to-win-elections-in-nigeria/,2019-01-27T09:35:42+01:00,"Hello there. Are you a politician in Nigeria or a wannabe, who has no plans whatsoever to be declared winner after all is said and done? Then you have come to just the right place my friend, as I will be sharing very rare tips on how not to win elections in Africa’s most populous country.
But first of all, you should know that you are not alone in this predicament. So you have absolutely no reason to feel embarrassed.
Think about it. At the last count, there are up to 91 political parties in Nigeria and up to 73 of those are fielding candidates for the presidential marathon. It is, after all, called party for a reason, right? Everyone is invited. And if you are not eligible, just gatecrash your way in – until some forgery case or zoning formula catches up with you.
Back to the topic of the day: Do not be fooled by the fact that so many people are doing it easily, i.e. losing elections. Truth is just as people like Mallam Nasir El-Rufai became accidental public servants, we have also had countless accidental losers in our nation’s long electoral history. But the good news is you don’t have to wait for accidents to happen. With recently emerging evidence in the scientific world, you can be deliberate about losing.
Compressed into this short listicle is over twenty years of research conducted by experts in various fields. By Jove, losing an election has never been this easy — but please be warned that the principles presented here are not universally applicable. They have only been tested and trusted as far as politics in Nigeria is concerned, and analysts predict that they will remain valid for at least another dozen years.
Prior warning:As this is a how-to piece for beginners, the level of straightforwardness may prove sickening, or even dangerous, to experienced folks. Reader’s discretion is advised.
The first thing you should note if you are contesting for a public office (with no intention to win of course) is you don’t need money. Not a dime! If you have lots of money, don’t bother wasting it. Just keep them somewhere safe and then come up with nice speeches like, “I do not believe in money politics. Nigerians now know better than to vote based on so-called stomach infrastructure.”
Trust me, people will fall for it like a house of cards and will not even remember you or your party’s name on election day, let alone vote for you.
If you want to take your campaign to the next level, you should in fact beg people to donate to your ambition. That is the way it’s supposed to be, right?  When you visit the local markets and bus stations and beer parlours and they ask you to “settle the boys”, just slowly breathe in and out, and then take your time to lecture them on how they should be the ones to settle you so that you can represent them well after elections. Tell them the politics of rice and stipends is of the old, and the politics of ideas is afoot.Bruh!You won’t just lose; studies have in fact shown that the margins of losing if this strategy is religiously adhered to are typically astounding.
Another quality you need to keep in check is “sense” — if you have too much of it. Nigerian voters have no liking for someone who knows too many things, speaks too many big words, gives too many statistics, or just somewhat sounds like he knows what he is saying. Who are we kidding? Is this the United States of America or some Scandinavian country with 100 percent literacy rate?
One more thing before we move on: All your MScs and PhDs and DLitts do not matter when it comes to elections. Nope. In fact, the lesser the degrees associated with your name, the better. Omoyele Sowore is one guy who gets the drift. Though believed to have a Master’s degree from Columbia University, he was quite smart to have registered only WAEC with the electoral commission.
Then again, if you can slide in one forged result or the other in your application too, there is an eighty percent chance it will work in your favour.
All these old parties, with so-called nation-wide reach, are corrupt. Everyone knows that. There is absolutely nothing you can achieve with them—except of course you intend to win, which is not the case. So please start your own political party. Trust me, Nigerians will understand. They will understand clearly what you are out to achieve. And, if you’re lucky, you might even get sympathy non-votes.
On the other hand, if starting a party is too much stress, you can join any of the eighty parties occupying 20 percent — if we’re generous — of our political space. Find a party whose headquarters is located on the borders between Abuja and Nasarawa or Abuja and Kogi. Find a party whose convention looks like an inaugural lecture. Or one whose Instagram followers can fit inside a luxurious bus. Any party with limitless losing potentials is fine really.
Ah yes! Good ol’ debates. This point is even so glaring that it has become a no-brainer.
I assure you there’s no more empirically effective way to guarantee your loss at the polls than participating in these intellectual exercises — especially for a presidential election. Case study: General Muhammadu Buhari. In 2007 and 2011, he was mounting podium up and down like a secondary school kid thirsty for medals (or wanting to make his girlfriend proud).
But, in 2015, Baba learnt his lesson the hard way and let Nigeria’s endangered political wisdom lead the way. Where are all the smart gentlemen debating policies and promises then, granting interviews like their life depended on it? Yeap! Some of them are still in the race today. Others have retired to an enviable life of “former presidential aspirant”.
And who is, today, our military head of state …. sorry, Commander-in-Chief? Your guess is as good as mine.
If you are one of those sane people who actually want to win elections, then ditch that debate. If you are sure one of the major candidates will fail to show up, you can even don yourbabarigaof confidence, go to the venue, take a couple of pictures as proof, zoom off before they start, and then hurry to Twitter to challenge the other dude to a friendly match — that you both know will never happen.
Posters,
banners, and handbills? Common man, those things are so 19th century. Where an
election is truly lost is on the internet. And that is where you should focus
your energy and restrict your campaign. Create beautiful electronic flyers.
Share them on your Facebook page with an enormous 30,000 followers, and your
verified Twitter handle with 50,000 followers — half of them bots.
You can add to this flawless strategy by saying such sensible things like the country’s “largest constituency”, which is the youth, are solidly behind and will vote massively for you — as if those climbing billboards and masts at the other rallies are youth from Chad and Benin Republic.
Or an idealist. Summarily, don’t play rough like the others. Be the nice kid on the queue, waiting patiently for his turn. Resist all temptations to manipulate people, especially your party members. Do not comprise. I repeat: do not compromise. Your track records as former this and that will speak for you. And if you are a great orator, even better.
The classic example here is Aunty Oby. If you are lucky enough to be blessed with her good fortune, your losing at the polls will not even be based on a balance of probability. Three or four weeks to the day of election, you already know your fate, and so you’ll be spared of any possible heart attack that may result from being declared winner.

Data back guarantee:If you do all these and still end up winning that election, please email a complaint totubosunajanaku@gmail.comcontaining evidence of your compliance and a scanned copy of your INEC certificate of return. Do that and I will refund how much you must have spent on internet access to read this. Kindly note that product warranty lasts only for the next 12 years … … well, hopefully, not any longer."
"In his grave, Abacha turns in envy as Buhari suspends CJN",https://punocracy.com/in-his-grave-abacha-turns-in-envy-as-buhari-suspends-cjn/,2019-01-26T08:26:41+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) ―Advanced satellite images available to The T.A. Report in the last 12 hours have shown an unusual level of disturbance in the graveyard of General Sani Abacha, former military dictator of Nigeria. The surrounding vegetation also appears to have become more lush and green, though it is not yet rainy season.
Mohammed Abacha, the late ruler’s eldest surviving son, has however helped with some context.
“This is not the first time we have heard deep rolling sounds from where baba was buried,” he told our geopolitical correspondent in a phone conversation.
He explained that such movements have always coincided with political events which the late ruler would have been deeply satisfied with had he been alive, adding that the movements have become more frequent since Muhammadu Buhari became Nigeria’s president in 2015.
“But we have not heard rolling sounds as loud and lengthy as that of Friday evening,” the younger Abacha said.
“My guess is that it has to do with General Buhari’s latest move, removing Walter Onnoghen as the Chief Justice of Nigeria and replacing him with Tanko. Baba would have been high on envy, considering that, with all his powers as a military head of state back then, the judiciary was still largely independent.”
Dr Aiyekooto Williams, an expert in Political Microbiology at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, has said given a scientific explanation for the colour changes noted around the grave.
“One of the miracles about the human body is that, even after death, hormones responsible for jealousy remain as active as ever,” he said.
“It is likely that these hormones, which have been found to contain significant amounts of chlorophyll, were somehow triggered and released into the surrounding soil.”
President-General Buhari had on Friday suspended Onnoghen as the Chief Justice of Nigeria and replaced him with Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed, over allegations of false assets declaration.
He cited an order from the Code of Conduct Tribunal as justification, but information available to The T.A. Report traced the origin of the order to the EFCC headquarters in Abuja, where the CCT chairman, Danladi Umar, has an open case file on bribery.
Abacha was Nigeria’s military Head of State for five years, ruling between 1993 and 1998. He was the seventh dictator to have ruled Nigeria and, with the exception of Abdulsalami Abubakar, political analysts are still debating whether he was the last.

Honouring those who deserve some accolades in 2018,https://punocracy.com/2018-national-honours/,2019-01-01T14:12:03+01:00,"Yesterday, 2018 held sway. But as of now, the defunct 2018 has left the pitch of existence for 2019 on a high. Many personalities have made its coming and leaving worthy of remembering. These people, by the virtue of weeks of assessing their exploits in the outgone year by a league of incorruptible judges, have been distinguished as worthy.
Aside the awardees, the panelists also deemed it to give out some takeaways to some honorary mentions.
So, where do we start from?
For months now, they’ve both been in the news. While one hoists his broom to say“let’s take Nigeria to the next level”,the other shields himself with his umbrella (mind not that we are in dry season) saying, let’s“get Nigeria working again”.
There hassles have been noticed by the panel of Judges. And in acknowledgement of the winning chances both have above their presidential faithful peers, Buhari and Atiku have won themselves additions to their libraries (if they have one). In order to fleshen Mr Atiku’s“getting Nigeria working again”agenda, his is a copy ofDaron Acemoglu’s and James A. Robinson’s Why Nations Fail.For his next level agenda, Mr Buhari getsLee Kuan Yew’s From Third World to First: The Singapore Story.
Shall the two septuagenarians match forward for their gifts?
For his grandiloquence all year long, his constantBalotellianstunts, his historicMourinhoicantics, and his occasional theatrics in and out of the hallow chamber, Senator Dino Melaye – representative of Kogi South Senatorial District – has won himself two basketful of freshly harvested okra from Obasanjo Farm.
One of this, the Judges say, would keep his mouth lubricated to talk and sing more. The other to aid the gliding of his muscles and joints to ease future attempts to jump out of police vans, disregard arrest warrants and not to forget, flaunt his vigorous dance steps.
Honourable Senator Dino, it’s yours in the taking: two basketful of okra — fresh from Obasanjo Farm!
From his“off the record”comment on the outrageous amount spent by the Federal Government in feeding the Islamic Movement of Nigeria incarcerated leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, to his“we have fulfilled all our election promises”, to his rebuffed“no ransom was paid for the release of the Dapchi girls”statement, the honourable Minister of Information has had his name reworded by some nosey Nigerians to Lie Muhammad. The Judges think rewording his name is an aberration to his regal office; rather, Nigerians should be rewarding his rare patriotism.
Hence, the Judges maintain that he be called Alhaji Lai Muhammad. And because “lie” isn’t a good appellation behind the title “Alhaji”, he is hereby gifted copies of the Holy Qur’an, Sahih Bukharee and Sahih Muslim – from which he might learn to be more prodigal with truth – strap by a 99-count comboloio to seek forgiveness if need be.
Alhaji Lai, it’s time to turn to the Lord. Accept this token with large heart.
And now to the awardees.Senator Bukola Saraki, this outgone year, showed ingenuity with his brand of politicking. Coming off from the circumstances that earned him the Senate presidency, the Kwara-born lawmaker beat even the best bookmakers to their wits. Lovers of creativity were still savouring this when he again deflects to the APC in grand style. If he had stopped there little could have been made of it; but the way he has held the seat of the Senate Presidency as a member of a minority party by wading off every impeachment move is classic. With these to Bukola’s name, he easily could have coasted home with the much coveted Conman of the Year award. But no! Bola Tinubu show that the award fits his palms better.
The Jagaban of Lagos state, the one who has been taunted by many to be paid Lagos money (Sanwo Eko), breathed life into the decaying carcass of Lamidi Adedibu of Oyo state. The former, when he lived, even though with little education, had governorship faithfuls groping at his feet. It is simple: you either join force with Adedibu or you are phased out of the governorship race. Same it is for Tinubu.
The manner with which Ambode’s second term bid was blown off by the Tinubu-led forces is absolutely exceptional. Clean. Perfectly executed. Such would have Nollywood playwrights licking their fingers because in it they have a blockbuster epic in the offing. He is why the name Sanwo-Olu is gradually replacing the name Ambode even before the election billed for March. Tinubu.
With a resounding round of applause, welcome Bola Tinubu as he steps forward for his award: Conman of the Year.
At first, it sounded like an English class where personification is taught. In the end it play out to be what it is said to be: a mysterious snake is said to have swallowed N36 million, no thanks to a sales clerk of JAMB office in Makurdi, Philomina Chieshe. Wonders didn’t seize there as a senator, Sheu Sani (Kaduna) announced that the then Chairman of Northern Senators Forum Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa) was removed because of a missing N70 million belonging to the Forum which is believed to have been carted away by monkeys which raided the farm house of the some executives of the Forum. If only animals could talk!
These money eating animals are, certainly, worthy winners of the Oddity of the Year but Peter Fayose won’t let that be. His“I’m in pain”thespian is simply unbeatable. What cemented his hands on this top prize is the popularity of his outcry. Only a few days back, the Chief Judge of this gala saw an injured young football player in the city of Fadeyi in Lagos mimic the“more than popular”politician. It truly shows that time and relevance are patient with his legacy.
So, who else deserves the Oddity of the Year if not Peter the Rock, Ayodele Fayose.
With 353 votes to his favour, PDP governorship candidate at Osun state election, Senator Ademola Adeleke, thinks he would dance his way to the state house to be installed the number one Osunman.
In a twist of event, the election is declared inconclusive, because as provided by the Electoral Act, when cancelled votes are more than the win margin, the election is said to be inconclusive. Nigerians are still shocked by what went down in Osun when, APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole speaks to the mic.
He says:“I think that for democracy to flourish, only people who can accept the pain of rigging, sorry, defeat should participate in an election”.
Of the speeches made in 2018, this certainly have every ingredient of a winning speech: talk of the oratorical charge in it, its sweet rhetoric, its brevity, the confidence with which it is mouthed and more importantly, the Freudian slip used by the Edo politician to convey his message.
Although, the“transmission… transmission”speech of the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, has a big shot at this award but it lacks the aforementioned qualities and it simply isn’t that convincing. Deservedly, our former labour leader has to his name the award of Speech of the Year.
With a standing ovation, give it up for Adams Oshiomhole, winner of the Speech of the Year award.
Shall we have all winners and honorary mentions have a group photograph?
Congratulations to all winners and non-winners. Everyone is a winner. Break more new grounds in 2019!"
"Deputy Priestess, Olori Odo and the politics of signature",https://punocracy.com/deputy-priestess-olori-odo-and-the-politics-of-signature/,2018-10-15T15:56:26+01:00,"By: Atiku Buhari
PRELUDEGone are those days when the Coven of Elere could get the signature of their Deputy Priest (an Islamic Sheik) on the road, in the toilet (Surprised? Ask his followers to confirm this), after teaching and in the office. Now that the Coven of Elere got a new Deputy Priestess (a gentle woman who always wears anger every time, everywhere. It was said she is from the North but a Yoruba) I have met and discussed with her two times: when I had problem getting her signature to fast track my admittance into the second level of the age group.
(Sitting on the chair watching a play, Deputy Priestess asked who was knocking on the door)
“Who is that?” She asked.
“A student” I answered.
(Frowning at me like Sango…)
“Hahan! What do you want in my shrine?” she asked.
“I have a problem with my results, ma’am” I replied.
(Raising her hand as if to slap me)
“Miraye wonranwonran, ko osie kuro nibi, I have a meeting to attend” she asked me to walk out of her office and not to forget to jam the door.
(Standing and gossiping, many younglings crowded at the entrance to her office to get the anointed signature because the admittance exam was fast approaching. She opened the door).
“If you don’t pack yourself from this place, I’ll report everyone to the Chief Priest, Eyin Omo tio ni lakaye (you, who do not have brain), you’re just coming to sign your Admittance Letter, she laughed derisively and walked down to the Chief Priest Shrine.
The two times I encountered the Deputy Priestess, Mama Ewe (mother of children) that was how she behaved, wearing lion face and walking like an elephant. But, isn’t it disappointing to see this kind of person appointed as Deputy Priestess of the Coven of Elere – a fearsome woman whose name negates her action?
*******When Sunday Mourning Crier had an interview with the Olori Odo of the Coven of Elere, a week ago, Mr Burukutu said one of his greatest success was that he helped students to plead with the Chief Priest and Deputy Priestess so that they gave more time and made the process of signing Admittance Letter easy for the students, especially the new intakes “We had good ears when it came to the problem revolving around signing Admittance Letter for the new intakes we had to plead with the Chief Priest and Deputy Priestess on their behalf to give them more time and even made the process easy for them”.
When the Olori Odo made that statement, what came to my mind was that he was high on something. I thought he had a problem with his eyes and thus could not see the difference between true and false and thus called anything false as truth. I wonder when Burukutu had helped younglings to talk to Deputy Priestess to sign their Admittance Letter.
I wonder when he met the Chief Priest concerning Admittance Letter. I wonder and wonder and wonder, how he reached that conclusion. As someone here would describe him,“Na liar Olori Ole we have”.
*******(Sitting with his legs crossed, the President beckons to a man in suit to enter the office.)“Good morning, Olori Odo, I am Kritik from Sunday Mourning Crier, I am here to have an interview with you” The man said.“Oh! Mr Kritik, how’re you doing sir? ”
“Fine”
(After engaging each other in handshaking, the interview commences)
“Olori Odo, so far this administration began what achievement can you lay claim to?”
(He laughed vigorously before he answered.)
“This is very clear even to the blind that my administration has done something unforgettable. First, I organized rehearsal every week, especially for the Fresh Younglings. You remember last year when about 400 (or thereabouts) Younglings were banished from the College of Agbowo, so, in other to forestall this, my administration deem it fit to organize rehearsal every week. And their results that came out recently have attested to our performance. In fact, I personally taught them the gods’ Language. You know, this is a service to humanity.”
“Ok, Olori Odo, it seems you’re the messiah that will lead the Coven of Elere to a greater height. What of the other achievements?”
“My Social Prefect, Rato, has been a very hardworking man. You know, before he was elected as a Social Prefect he said he would make the coven lively. And as the saying goes, all work no play makes Jack a dull boy. We don’t come to school only to read, read and read. We’re here also to improve our social life. So, every Friday, he jokes with younglings at the quadrangle. That also is our achievement.
“But, Olori Odo, are you implying that because he jokes on Friday, he has performed his duty as a Social Prefect?”“You this Criers, you like to criticise. If that’s not an achievement, then what is?” Burukutu said.
“Olori, don’t get angry. OK. Last semester, your Writing Prefect, Mr. Rijan was suspended for a couple of weeks because he wrote in an ancient language. Has he renounced his savage ways of writing in the ancient Language? You know, not all people understand the ancient language.”
“Haaa! Who told you that he writes in ancient language? Don’t listen to those FLC (Fine Liars’ Council) people. They are just rabble rouser. Rijan has been the best Labour Prefect that I would ever work with. In fact, to say this, if not because of him, my language would not have been so perfect like this. He teaches me Grammar every week. Imagine such a brilliant guy!”
“All right, in this semester what are your plans for the students?”
“We’re planning to have our hunting in some weeks’ time. We would take them all over Nigeria, especially Lagos and Abuja to see how beautiful Nigeria is. We will go to beach and lots. Also, we’re planning to issue Everlasting ID Charm. I’ve contacted them in London to make the work snappy so that we give them as soon as possible.”
“Ok. It was reported recently that the FLC (Fine Liars’ Council) planned to have a quiz competition that will allow some brilliant younglings to get home some cash for their parents. Besides, the CPS (Council of Prefect Secretaries) plans to organize a seminar on arts and tradition in collaboration with Institute of African Studies. Olori, students are complaining that you’ve been sleeping on a bicycle for so long and yet you’ve not learnt how to wake up from your slumber. How true is that?”
“Mr Kritic, don’t listen to those thieves. Since this administration begun they’ve been standing against our progress. Whenever we lay our good plans for them to see, they will sha find a way to burn down the plans with their malevolent hands of Slashing. They don’t want progress for us. But I know one thing, we shall overcome their evil acts. This Coven of Elere will be great again. We shall not relent. In a week, students will get to see the samples of things we have in stock for them. We shall tell the world that we’re the best administrators.”
“OK, nice to meet you, Mr Burukutu”
(Both Mr Kritic and the President, Mr Burukutu stood and shook hands with each other before they dispersed.)
The interview ended.
Like an itinerant preacher, stories journey, with no beginning nor a permanent bus stop. This is not the beginning, and this is not the end of this story.

Buhari ranked head of state with highest integrity following finance minister’s exit — report,https://punocracy.com/buhari-ranked-head-of-state-with-highest-integrity-following-finance-ministers-exit%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8areport/,2018-09-17T07:44:47+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)―President Muhammadu Buhari has overtaken Vladmir Putin of Russia and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda to become the head of state with the highest level of integrity in the world, according to a recent report.
The report, which was compiled by one of Africa’s leading think tanks, Progressive Hailers Inc., attributes this historic rise to the resignation of Kemi Adeosun, Nigeria’s former Finance Minister, on Friday.
Nasir El-Rufai, founder of the think tank and editor-in-chief of the 2018 report, while addressing journalists in Abuja on Saturday praised the Buhari administration and said such a resignation is unprecedented all over the world.
“We all know this administration is one that holds on to firm principles of fairness and honesty, but we had no idea it was this impressive,” he said.
The polls and extensive data analysis conducted by the agency over the past few days all point in the same direction, he said: that Buhari is the president with the highest level of integrity in the world, especially following Adeosun’s resignation.
“We would know,” he added with a reluctant smile, “because we work closely with Mr President.”
Femi Adeshina, Buhari’s special adviser on media and publicity, was also at the press conference. Addressing reporters, he said the resignation of a minister following such allegations has never happened anywhere else in the world.
“We keep saying it. This administration does not joke with integrity. It is the horse upon which we defeated the former ruling party and rode to power, and we will continue to sustain the vibe,” he said.
“We are glad the Progressive Hailers Inc. has given a stamp to this evident truth, and we are certain this report will pave the way for another landslide victory at the coming general elections.”
In response to why it took 69 days for the minister the resign, Adeshina said Buhari needed to take permission from China.
“Actually, Mr President would have acted earlier, but we realised we would be violating one of our 2370 agreements with the Republic of China if we did so without prior consultation. This is why it took so long.”
“All things being equal, this won’t be necessary anymore as soon as we pay up our debts some 200 years from now,” he added.

At a gathering of select pressmen, the war veteran revealed that while he was Nigerian President, he“played football, used the gym, and walked long distances without having to run to London.”
“Sometimes I would race members of my cabinet, and we found it particularly interesting as it allowed us bound. We were fit to run the nation, fit to kick balls around, and fit to carry our agbada”,the elder statesman joked.The former President when asked if he thought former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar fit for power responded,“Many players will go to training with their peers, but only a few of them would be fit for excellence.”The light-hearted statesman didn’t leave stones unturned on defections currently happening in the political scene.“The question isn’t why they are moving from one party to the other, the major question is, are they all fit for office? Beyond their pot bellies, and car jumping stunts, how many of them have the capacity to address the Olympic needs of Nigeria?”
When asked by Punocracy reporter; Peculiar Mess if he thought he was fit for a third term, and if he would ever return to active roles in Nigerian politics, the old man responded,“Third term agenda came, but it failed to happen, and that has not taken my relevance in politics. And while I might not be seen as active in Nigerian politics these days, I accommodate Nigerian politicians at my place who would like to learn the art. At this age I cannot be fighting for attention; from the north to the south, na them dey rush us.”The engaging media briefing ended on a light note as The General thrilled journalists to a work out session.

Certificate forgery is test of ‘a true Nigerian politician’ — says Information Minister,https://punocracy.com/certificate-forgery-is-test-of-a-true-nigerian-politician-says-information-minister/,2018-08-13T07:48:43+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) ― Most Nigerians seem not to get it, Information Minister Alhaji Lai Mohammed has said, that the ability to forge a certificate is the hallmark of “a true Nigerian politician”.
He made this statement in Abuja at the International Youth Day event organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture on Saturday.
In response to a question from the audience, the honourable minister said he finds it surprising that Nigerians are still shocked over certificate forgery scandals “of everything to be shocked about”.
“Certificate forgery?” he asked rhetorically. “Common! That is like one of the compulsory subjects in the Common Entrance Examination of the Nigerian Political Academy.”
“Please take note that I said common entrance,” he added, “not even SSCE or Post-UTME. It is very basic; so basic that we should no longer make a fuss about if we are serious as a nation.
“After all these years, after revelations upon revelations, how can we still be calling for politicians to resign because of an ordinary forged certificate. If that is what we want, then Nigeria will have no leaders, because there are only two types of politicians in this country: those who have been caught forging a certificate, and those who are waiting to be caught.”
Mohammed also described forging as the cheapest crime to commit, but said many like Kemi Adeosun, Nigeria’s Finance Minister, are still novices in the art.
“I wonder what kind of politician you are if you cannot forge a simple certificate and get away with it,” he said. “This is why I keep telling fresh bloods not to rush into politics without first learning from the grand masters.”
“Kemi’s case is special as she was appointed because of her forgery record. Itse Sagay was only being politically correct when he said she is a brilliant minister in spite of her forgery. In actual fact, she is a brilliant minister because of it.
“This administration is committed to fishing out and sanctioning companies and individuals who forge tax certificates, and we know it takes one thief to recognise another. And honestly, she tried because she’s had a clean public record, until those guys at Premium Times beamed their wicked light in her direction.”
The Information Minister promised that, in Buhari’s second term, the government will ensure to employ only expert forgers, who leave no trails behind them, because “we can’t afford to be wasting time on these small issues”.

“The mother of our teacher is died”,https://punocracy.com/the-mother-of-our-teacher-is-died/,2018-08-10T07:55:52+01:00,"I did pay a visit to my alma mater recently, a school located in Ibadan. Government-owned. Of course, I would have loved to reel out the name of the school but for the absence of usual alma mater pride following what I saw in the course of my visit. You know, when you finish from Harvard, you would without hesitation announce ‘I finished from Harvard’. You would even anticipate the question, won’t you? That is the chance to let everyone know you are not their mate.
But you do not even need to finish from Harvard, there are secondary schools in Ibadan, Oyo State that you would proudly announce you finished from and there are others, you shy away from the question wishing it never pops up. Yes, I went to one in the latter category. Do not expect a name.
I am unemployed. I have been unemployed for two years. You should understand why someone wakes one morning and decides to go to his alma mater without planning to make a donation. I just left a job interview at Molete and I felt I should not go home with this shirt starched and looking all good for the first time in a while. Should I just stroll in? I did.
I happened to have come in while they were on the short break. The thirty minutes break. In the commotion of ecstasy and joy, I could still remember myself in a group like this chasing balls and trying to get food or ‘base’. Those days, it was either you got food or you got ‘base’. Base is what happens when you get a plate regardless of the fact that you did not buy food. You go from one friend to the other with this plate asking for one spoon or base. On days when you were lucky or pestered enough, you ended up eating more food than those who even bought. Base, base, base, base and you are fed.
I could still remember the time-table. After break it was Mathematics on Mondays and Wednesdays and it was Physics on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The same teacher took us Mathematics and Physics so his face was the end of the joy of break. Mr. Waliyu we called him then. He was really the end of joy. Short and dark with sharp tribal marks. He looked like the overused simile — a man who had been in a fight with a lion.
But in addition to having looked like a man who had fought a lion, Mr. Waliyu must have also stolen the voice of the lion so he seemed to roar fright. Some evaded school for the entire day once they went for break and he had his way to get them punished. As heavy as the punishment was, we still dared it especially when we had not done his assignments.
I had not spent close to 15 minutes in the premises when a ball hit my starched shirt and this boy comes around. He picks the ball and runs back like nothing happened. Like he had simply hit a pole and it had bounced the ball back. I would call him and ask ‘did you not see you hit me?’ And he would reply ‘did you not see the ball coming?’. I decided to let it go. It must be the wages of my sin.
I roamed through the dormitory, classes and favourite spots of the past. They seemed more damaged than they were then. At least, we still had three or four louvres standing in the classes when I was in school. On that day, no semblance of a glass stood in the way of the foul air that came from the school toilet. It was a free access. The absence of a glass now helped the window to serve as another entrance for impatient students who could not use the door due to congestion or as the escape route for those who needed to leave the boring classes.
The ceilings had ended finally their indecision if to just open their mouth and stare at the floors. They had come down in embrace of their long lost friend Mr. Floor and the reunion left timber planks supporting leaking roofs open to view. The timber planks had all over them termites of various sizes whose goal is to send the entire roof down.
A bit of my wandering and the lab had torn diagrams which had been there since I finished 10 years ago. I remember the rest of those diagrams from what is left of them. I was laboratory prefect. The test tubes had all become broken. Broken such that they stood in the holds with more lost than what was left in them. The blackboard still stood well, I must speak the truth. It was in good condition. But a blackboard in this century?
I was done with my sightseeing. I would desire leaving. But on my way out, I noticed it seemed the break had not ended. The sight of students breaking melon shells, removing stems from pepper and one even operating a hand grinding machine brought back the familiar memory of female teachers and how they utilised the labour of their students. The staff room had not emptied yet to signify the end of the break. There was still an on-going discussion. It was heated. The teachers were passionate.
The last classroom that would attract my interest was that of my secondary school love. Her name is Bimpe. She is in Italy the last I heard of her. The last I saw of her was when she was leaving a popular abortion clinic at Iwo Road in the company of two other ladies. She was too tired to speak while I was too unemployed to greet her.
I just stared in the class for a quick look and I noticed a jubilant atmosphere. I did not want to be left out. So I asked for what was happening. They stared around and did not understand English. So they summoned this girl, whose name would interestingly turn out as Bimpe. ‘Bimpe,so eyinbo siwon pada. Awa o gbo eyinbo tin so‘. (Bimpe, reply his English. We cannot). I asked little Bimpe for what the cause of the joy was.
And she told me with a broad smile, revealing a bright set of teeth…“the mother of our teacher is died.”"

Scene I
It’s the zero hour. Nobody slept all night. Everything is set for the war. Commanders are busy, surreptitiously dispatching orders and supplies to the frontlines. The night before the war is the most crucial night. It’s the night before the dawn of victory or the groan of defeat. It’s also the night treachery wears the cloak of loyalty, clinging tightly to the battledress of the commander-in-chief, with eyes glazed on the treasury chest. What a night!
National anthem:
Arise, O compatriots
Nigeria’s call obey
To serve our fatherland…
Continuity announcer:I say a very good morning to you, our cherished listeners, out there. This is Ekiti Kete Broadcasting Service, transmitting on Frequency 41.9. I welcome you to our first programme of the day, “Ekiti Decides.” As you all know, 35 candidates are set to slug it out in today’s governorship election. I’ll take you right into our studio where our indefatigable politics editor, Dimeji Ologbenla, is waiting. Over toyou, Dimeji.
Ologbenla:Thank you, Wale Aberuagba. Good morning, Nigeria. You’re welcome to another edition of your incisive programme, “Ekiti Decides.” Today, we shall be analysing the election results as they trickle in from the 177 wards of the 2, 185 polling units in the 16 Local Government Councils of the state. The total number of registered voters for this election is 913,334 but only 630,000 voters have their PVCs in readiness for this landmark election. I have with me in the studio Comrade Tunji Aduroja, Alhaji Mukaila Ehinola, Apostle Jesusegun Olorunjeda, and an Ifa worshipper, Baba Ifaleke Famoriyo. Your opinions,gentlemen.
Comrade:The power of incumbency will play a major role. Remember, Nigerian politics still feeds fat on violence. Any of the party that controls the mechanisms of violence will have an edge.
Alhaji:Money will play a deciding factor in this election. Ekiti civil servants are hungry; they’re being owed several months of salary arrears. Anybody who dangles the carrot will have their votes. The fatter your carrot, the higher your votes.
Famoriyo:There’s no sincerity among our political class. The skirt and blouse are of the same fabric. Ifa hates deceit. Ekiti must vote wisely.
Ologbenla:Gentlemen, let me link up with our correspondents out there to have a feel of the field…
PHCN strikes. Programme goes off air.

Peter Rock:Are you saying 16-0 has won in that LG, Blahlah?
Blahlah:He has won o. People were complaining that you didn’t pay workers’ salaries arrears, yet you raised money to bribe voters in the election.

Hitler:I’m not excited, Sir. I’m breathing heavily ni, Sir. I was hotly pursued by voters. When they received minty N5,000 each from Johnny, they came after me, saying if Johnny who’s not a governor could give N5,000, Apata Ayeraye should be able to give more. They caught Eyin-Ejo, Sandpaper and Petrol and beat them to a pulp. They broke their necks and hands. They too now need neck braces and slings, they too are touching their heads and weeping like infants denied breast milk.

"Common Sense leaves UI, promises not to come back",https://punocracy.com/common-sense-leaves-ui-promises-not-to-come-back/,2018-07-11T05:33:22+01:00,"Agbowo, Ibadan —In the early hours of today, Common Sense was spotted leaving the University of Ibadan.
Eyewitnesses observed that Common Sense was first seen leaving the Tekana Tamuno Building angrily today.
He, however, stopped at Queen Elizabeth II Hall to meet the Hall Warden, as earlier agreed between the two parties, to finalize their inconclusive discussion on the suspension of all elected executive members of the Hall. Too shocked to see what he saw, he could not stay as long as he had planned.
“I’m too shocked. I can’t believe this!” he reportedly said, almost in tears.
Now in tears, he continued, “I don’t think I belong here. I’m leaving this University,” adding that, “I’m leaving Queens Hall. I’m leaving the Hall Warden herself. None of them deserves my service.”
While at the exit to the school, he granted our reporter a brief interview.
Asked why he has decided to leave a University like the University of Ibadan, a supposed “home of sense” — common and uncommon, his response was sharp:
“I have tried. I have been sidelined for too long in this University,” he explained.
“See what the school has done in the past few weeks. Students of the school paid SUG due, a Union its management proscribed a year ago.
“Even though the VC had called for the refunding of the levy, till date, no student has been refunded. That is a stain on my personality! That would have been my last stint here. But I decided to let it slip.”
He added: “Shortly afterwards, a student was rusticated for two semesters because of an article he wrote on the poor attention given to the interiors of the school’s halls of residence.
“I thought the management would useMeby looking into the student’s observations, and seeing the observation as a call to action; but…no. Again, I was relegated to the sidelines.”
Now with a louder pitch, he charged on: “As if that was not enough torture on me, Queens Hall management hit me with a deeper blow.”
He brought out a paper containing the list of the new executive, using his index finger to draw the attention of our reporter to it. “See; look at this. Overhauling an entire elected-executive and appointing new ones without the residents of the Hall having a say was done withoutMe,” he moved on, hitting his chest in the process.
“So, when I say I don’t belong here I know what I’m saying.
“I know that, though, I’m called Common Sense, but my presence is not common to everyone. And I didn’t expect Queens Hall management to lackMeafter I had advised them and had many discussions with the Hall Warden especially.”
Asked where he will go from here, “the gown has failed me,” he replied, “I’ll go to the town. Maybe the town will make good use of me. But for now, University of Ibadan…bye bye.”

RUSSIA 2018: “We won’t return empty handed” – Gernot Rohr assures Nigerians,https://punocracy.com/russia-2018-we-wont-return-empty-handed-gernot-rohr-assures-nigerians/,2018-06-15T17:58:51+01:00,"(Yessentuki, Russia)— Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr, has promised Nigerians his lads will bring back laurels as they look forward to their world cup opening game against Croatia tomorrow.
He made this vow in his address to the Press few days after the team arrived to their hotel Sanatorium Istochnik in Yessentuki, Russia.
Resplendent in green and white embroidery with hats and shoes to match, Super Eagles had arrived aboard a chartered flight from Austria at the Mirealnye Vody Airport which is about 35 kilometres to their lodge.

“We are optimistic,” he began. “We won’t come as far east as Russia and go back to Nigeria with empty hands. We won’t,” he continued, beating his chest, wearing a wide grin.
“We know we have 31 other competitors who are also eyeing the trophy as we do. We are not disturbed by this. Because we have other plans – that which others are not considering.
“Because we are smart and for the love of Nigeria’s cultural richness, we have tapped into the country’s cultural wealth. We not only did this, we have given a nod to the team’s football identity: which is their hallmark of embroidered Eagle wings and a football on the chest and collar of the team’s jersey.
“Doing this, we hope, even if the trophy won’t come to Nigeria after it did before the tournament started, we have another trophy we can be guaranteed of winning.”

Curiously, a reporter present quickly asked what trophy he was talking about.
He smiled, then said, “I’m surprised most of you have not been smart enough to read the handwritings on the wall. We are on course to win the best dressed team in World Cup.
No team, at least as far as I know, has a larger chance of winning the most fashionable team here,” he paused, as if trying to confirm people’s reaction to his claim. “Or do you know of any?”
“From our jersey to our travel outfit, all are aimed at tucking some smiles in the corner of the mouths of Nigerians. Also, we are using this strategy to boost the lad’s confidence. If we win the world cup, that will be a plus. But as it stands we are not going to return empty handed.”
Immediately he spotted a German reporter sitting to his right, he added in German,“Wir versprechen – we promise.”All that was heard after this were giggles, claps and flashes of camera shots.
The Super Eagles are drawn in group D alongside Croatia, Iceland and Argentina. They will kick start their campaign tomorrow against Croatia.

#ThisIsNigeria; Buhari reacts,https://punocracy.com/thisisnigeria-buhari-reacts/,2018-06-11T17:59:13+01:00,"The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR took to Twitter to transmit a piece of his mind on popular trend, #ThisIsNigeria, courtesy of Falz the Bahd guy. The President, who is known for swiftly reacting to matters affecting Nigeria, utilised twitter to give his own account of the trend. The tweet which was posted on his personal page on June 11, 2018 — a day to June 12 celebrations — read; “#ThisIsNigeria where our lazy youths only complain about #EndSars”.

While many Nigerians and friends of the country must be worrying about what could have prompted the action, our reporter gathered from the President’s media team that the President was beginning to get tired of Nigerians always blaming him for problems he inherited when they could be focused on other activities. The media team through Mr. Femi Adesina said, “He is tired of people blaming him for problems PDP acquired over 16 years of existence, there is only so much that he can do.” Mr. Adesina mentioned further, “Nigerian youths can focus on being lazy or doing yahoo yahoo, instead of trying to protest unfair treatment in their country.”
Nigerian youths over the past few days have reawakened the #EndSars campaign after members of FSARS started arresting young men randomly, detaining and dehumanising them on accusations of cultism. The social protesters directed their anger towards the Presidency, whom they consider incapable, for turning blind eyes and deaf ears to their complaints. The hardworking President has since reacted, telling Nigerian youths to stop complaining.

"With N41k jersey, Nigeria’s world cup victory is guaranteed — Sports Minister",https://punocracy.com/with-n41k-jersey-nigerias-world-cup-victory-is-guaranteed-sports-minister/,2018-06-11T07:03:40+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)―Nigeria’s sports minister Solomon Dalung has said the country’s unique jersey at the world cup is key to her guaranteed victory.
Dalung, who wasdeclared persona non grataby the Plateau state government in April, said this while addressing newsmen on Monday at a press briefing organised by the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.
He assured Nigerians the ministry, in conjunction with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), is doing all it can to push the nation’s soccer team to the world cup finals, and ultimately to victory.
“We are bringing the cup home,” he said confidently. “Though we have spent close to 90% of our budget for the competition to pay for the jersey design and production, it is worth every penny because that is all we need to win anyway.”
“We are the super eagles. We all know the eagle cannot soar without its mighty feathers. That is exactly what the jersey will do. Dazzle our opponents, charm the referee, and allow us fly effortlessly to victory. Rest assured that with the N41000 jersey, which don’t forget has been adjudged world-favourite, our win is guaranteed.”
Asked why the country has only won one out of five friendly matches played so far and why the team has seemed disorganised during play, he explained that all this has been deliberate.
“It is all part of our strategy,” he said in a whisper. “It is top secret.”
He continued: “I cannot reveal all the intricacies because we paid a lot of money to Israeli experts to draft it for us. But I will say this: the team is achieving two things with those perceived losses, one is conserving energy for the big games and two is affording an element of surprise card later on.”
“Looking disorganised is all part of the plan too,” he added, with a smirk. “Why do you think we have numerous black zigzags on our jersey? It is so to make our unlucky opponents dizzy during the games. You see, we intend to prove to the world that playing without a straightforward plan or method can as well be a genius plan in itself.”
The sports minister, it will be recalled, once triggered widespread criticism when he suggested that preparation is not required to excel in sports, but “a winning penalty”.
“The disabled athletes have shown that all you need is a winning penalty and not too much preparation, they trained under the same condition with their able-bodied counterparts but they are winning medals now,” he had remarked.
He also once said “nobody even knew the team [Super Falcons] would emerge victorious” at the African Women’s Nations Cup tournament, and that was why they were not paid their bonuses and allowances.

The sophisticated art of law-making you can find only in Nigeria,https://punocracy.com/the-sophisticated-art-of-law-making-you-can-find-only-in-nigeria/,2018-05-21T06:03:36+01:00,"The art of making laws dates back thousands of years and is as old as politics itself ― possibly older, if we consider divine laws. But that is not to say mankind has mastered it from countless years of experience. Far from it. All over the world, we see legislators making dumb laws, useless laws, too useful laws, or no law at all ― while none of these things is inherently wrong; it all depends on how they make those laws. All over the world, except in Nigeria, you see.
Law-making in Africa’s largest country may be only about a hundred years old, but it has evolved so rapidly that it will take western nations at least a century to catch up. Our law-makers are the most sophisticated in the world, and this is fact not opinion. If you are honoured to pay any of them a visit to their homes or offices, you will be greeted by an endless array of glittering plaques and awards, from student associations, trade unions, and even professional award-giving organisations―an attestation truly to their unrivalled expertise and skills.
Here are some of the traits you will find in the Nigerian mace-housing chambers that you may find nowhere else; traits that have been developed over the years through hard work and dedication.
The Salary
With great talents come great emoluments, said Aristotle in one of his many undiscovered books. As it is not easy to be the best law-making machinery in the world, our legislators often get a take-home pay that can sponsor a two-way ticket to heaven―even though that is not their home (nothing intended please). Seriously, it is one thing to be diligent in duty and another to be courageous enough to give honour to whom it is due―yourself.
The best part is that, to show just how sophisticated they can be, Nigerian lawmakers deliberately decide not to get all their remuneration through lawful means. It is only the average mind that knows and treads only one path to the market. The hallmark of a true genius is diversification – of purposes, of processes, and, most importantly, of allowances. Nowhere in the world will you see diversification in the legislative body as diverse as we have it in Nigeria.
Not to forget the omerta – mafia code of silence – that has been incorporated into the senate rules. It requires that no member of the house shall divulge exactly how much they earn, and if by any chance or accident the house budget is released, the part about allowances of law-makers must be written in Latin, Hebrew, or any other dead language of the world.
The Cars
Not just any cars though, Nigerian law-makers only drive bulletproof cars. It is the law. He who must make the best of laws must have the best of livelihood, Thomas Acquinas was reputed to have said on his death bed when no one was around. Nigeria is a country that has just survived decades of military rule, and bulletproof cars are a necessary measure to ensure we do not slip into that era of endless coups.
But the fact that a car is bulletproof does not also mean it is wear-and-tear-proof. So these cars ― the best of them there are ― must be bought every fiscal year. Whatever happens to the previous ones is no one’s business. No one.
The Sleep
Yes, you read that correctly. Sleep. So simple an art, yet so sophisticated. You have to understand there is sleeping and there is sleeping. It is in grades. The kind our lawmakers engage in is not made in Nigeria. It requires maximum focus and steadfastness. And it is also very necessary. Why? It is during these diplomatic visits to the dreamland that the gods reveal the most brilliant legislative ideas ― such as the social media bill.
The Solidarity
Imagine how difficult it is for four persons to be friends for four years. Now agree with me as I say it takes great expertise for 109 (or 360 as the case may be) lawmakers to be united through thick and thin for four straight years. It is not easy, with all that intelligence and money, for people to agree on certain things, especially when the law is a victim. Classic example is when Uncle Dino tried to evade arrest. The average senate – including even the respected U.S. Senate – would have suspended Uncle Melaye. But our lawmakers are too smart for that. Instead, they suspended senate sitting in honour of their victimised colleague and have declared war against his persecutors. Bravo!
The Summons
We all know the saying that no one is above the law. But most are not aware that this expression is a bastardisation of the original saying: no one is above the lawmakers ― err, perhaps with the slight exception of journalists sitting in the chamber gallery. But this, to borrow from our communications minister, is inconsequential.
It is because of this fact that the Senate has the right ― and knows ― to summon everyone and anyonesummonable. There is no exception to this simple rule: at the fall of the gavel in the chamber, every head shall bow, even if it belongs to atransmissioner― sorry, I mean, commissioner ― of police. If thesummoneeshould dare send a well-informed and able representative, the legislators are wise enough to see through this mischief. And, of course, as common sense demands, they put the delegate where he belongs: outside the chamber.


If you agree with all I have said, say aye! If you disagree, say aye! Yeap ― just as I predicted ― the ayes have it.

"United Kingdom, Brazil offer to treat IGP Idris ‘free of charge’",https://punocracy.com/united-kingdom-brazil-offer-to-treat-igp-idris-free-of-charge/,2018-05-19T21:35:00+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report)―The United Kingdom and Brazil have on Saturday offered to assist in getting Inspector General of Police Ibrahim Idris treated free of charge.
Their representatives in Nigeria made these statements during a state banquet held at the presidential villa, Abuja, and organised by the office of the president. The banquet is held every year to reinforce Nigeria’s relations with foreign countries and ensure an increased inflow of foreign investments.
Paul Thomas Arkwright, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, said the United Kingdom is willing to offer free medical services to the IGP in order to save the country “from future embarrassments”.
“Immediately I saw that video, I placed a call to the British foreign affairs ministry,” he said. “And we have agreed to come in if permitted.”
“Though the IGP has said the video was doctored, we all know the only person who should be seeing a doctor is the IGP himself. Our best hands in the UK have conducted preliminary studies and are ready to take up this case free of charge, in the best interest of everyone.
“For us, this is a way of saying thank you for the years of patronage our health sector has enjoyed from the Nigerian ruling class, not excluding Mr President himself.”
Also present at the meeting was Maria Auxiliadora Figueiredo, ambassador of Brazil to Nigeria, who said her country is ready to bring its greatest experts in native medicine to Nigeria for an intensive therapeutic session with the IGP.
“High-ranking officers, we hear, have suggested spiritual forces to be at play here, and I find merit in this,” she noted. “We wish to commit to employing our best native doctors to conduct a thorough check-up for the police boss. This is a matter of national security, and must not be handled with levity.”
Arkwright also used to occasion to apologise to President Muhammadu Buhari for what he described as an oversight on the part of the British royal family in failing to invite him to the wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
“We understand that this event is taking place with the president here personally because he was not invited for the Royal Wedding, and we apologise for this oversight,” he said.
“I suppose the royal family thought, given his many visits in recent time, His Excellency must have grown tired of seeing England already,” he added as he let out a giggle.

Obama for Local Government Chairman │Pius Adesanmi,https://punocracy.com/obama-for-local-government-chairman-by-pius-adesanmi/,2018-05-17T06:23:06+01:00,"This is an extract from Naija No Dey Carry Last, a book by Nigeria’s ‘King of Satire’ Pius Adesanmi,first published hereby Premium Times. The book was published in 2015, and may be bought in bookshops across Nigeria, or online.
Dear President
Obama:
Apologies for crashing this unsolicited letter into your tight schedule. I am directed by my conscience to write you urgently with regard to your recently disclosed tax returns for the 2009 fiscal year. You and your wife declared a joint annual income of USD 5.5 million out of which Uncle Sam sliced USD 1.8 million in taxes.
In essence the President of the United States and his wife jointly made USD 3.2 million in 2009! The bulk of that money is from book sales and not from your salary and perks of office.
Mr. President, this is truly frustrating and embarrassing. You have only just hosted Goodluck Jonathan, the Acting President of Nigeria. All those ministers, governors, and ‘miscellaneous aides’ you saw grinning from ear to ear behind him are known in Nigerian parlance as his “entourage”. Some of those fellas could make your annual income in just one ‘food for the boys’ contract in Abuja. A contract that will never be executed even after full payment has been made upfront.
Some of them could even spend your annual income on a Dubai vacation with a girlfriend – usually an undergraduate sourced for them by aides. Your annual income, Mr. President, is in the region of what an ordinary local government chairman could claim to have spent on “stationery, entertainment, and miscellaneous” in the first quarter of a given fiscal year in Nigeria. If you ever visit Nigeria and spend 24 hours, Mr. President, Aso Rock and the National Assembly could easily invent a supplementary budget way beyond your annual income to host you.
I have given you these background details so that the suggestion I am about to make would not sound outrageous to you. Mr. President, you and Mrs. Obama are wasting time in America. You are violating the message in this Yoruba proverb – omo to pa owo wale ni iya e nki kaabo (a mother reserves a special welcome only for the child who brings home sack loads of money)”. In the spirit of this proverb, I suggest you resign as President of the United States, an office that can only guarantee you less than $5 million a year, and move to Nigeria urgently.
A man of your stature should have no problem becoming a Nigerian citizen within 48 hours. If there are problems, authentic citizenship papers can be arranged very quickly once you land in Lagos. Ask people about Oluwole. It is election season in Nigeria and I think you should contest for chairmanship of a local government area.
Mr. President, I am suggesting local government chairmanship because it is the only safe haven left to make dollars in millions in Nigeria. You are a man whose modesty and simplicity are legendary. The money you would make at the local government level would be way beyond what you and Mrs. Obama have ever dreamt of, but you would still be able to maintain your sanity and return to America with enough money to merit that special welcome by Mrs. Obama’s mother.
To advise you to run for political office at the state or federal level in Nigeria is to expose you to pure madness. Unfortunately, the madness at those levels is viral and contagious. As governor, rep, senator, minister, or Aso Rock hang-around, we are talking of hundreds of millions, or even billions of loot able dollars.
Mr. President, I am not sure that your mental frame could take the idea of being suddenly plunged into the category of the less than 5% of 150 million Nigerians who could make five hundred million dollars in just one deal, have difficulty spending it, and discuss it like chicken change in the public sphere. That is what we are talking about once you venture beyond the local government level that I am recommending. Mind you, a great deal of the money you would make would be loads and loads of raw cash – transported endlessly in what we call Ghana-must-go bags by your aides. If you encounter a man called James Ibori, he will introduce you to the art of ferrying raw cash daily from Nigeria to Dubai – all that cash passing through Nigerian airports unchecked.
This is the sort of vicious, symbolic violence Nigerians have to cope with everyday. Violence is the knowledge that not a single Nigerian is able to confidently declare that we have one, just one, elected official anywhere in the country who isn’t stealing at the levels I have described. Violence is the kind of figures that are in the newspapers every day: billions and billions being looted in broad daylight by our friends in Abuja and the state capitals. That is terrible knowledge that erodes the sanity of every ordinary Nigerian bit by bit.
Mr. President, if you know that you are going to be able to deal with the quantity of cash available for loot as a governor, rep, senator or Aso Rock insider without losing your mind, then by all means contest for office at those levels. And please do not deceive yourself that you could go there and be principled. The truth of the matter is that every elective office in Nigeria is by nature rigged to turn you into an instant multi-millionaire in dollars.
If you rebel against the nature of your office, Mr. President, if you try to stay above the muck and rot, you will become a clear and present danger to all the Ali Babas around you. They will kill you. So, just go to Nigeria, spend four years jejely as a local government chairman, and return to America with the kind of money that will ensure that your two daughters will never have to work.

Yours sincerely,
Professor Tatafo"
"Buhari to critics: London and Nigeria are one, I am not on foreign medical trip ― ‘per se’",https://punocracy.com/buhari-to-critics-london-and-nigeria-are-one-i-am-not-on-foreign-medical-trip-%e2%80%95-per-se/,2018-05-11T08:27:47+01:00,"LONDON (The T.A. Report) — President Muhammadu Buhari, through a statement released on Thursday by his senior spokesman, Garba Shehu, has denied claims that he is on an ongoing foreign medical trip in London.
These allegations are quite misleading, he said, because they make it seem as though the United Kingdom has no strong political and historical ties with Nigeria.
“I have chosen London out of many other countries because we are one and the same,” Buhari said.  “So it is wrong to say I am on a foreign medical trip. I am not per se. This is because we are all part of the same commonwealth, sharing a common history and similar traditions.”
“I could have easily picked some other country,” he added. “West Germany maybe. Or Luxembourg which has the best healthcare facilities in the world. But no, I chose London. It is not even ranked among thetop 16 in the world.”
The statement continued: “Nigerians should understand that the President is not blind to their plights or deaf to their complaints. He knows hospital staffs are on strike across the nation, and this is exactly why he travelled at this time to replicate global standards and practices here at home.
“He is not just receiving treatment in London. He is also receiving training and enlightenment on how to reform the health sector in Nigeria. In short, all this is just to get him prepared to make radical changes during his guaranteed second term.
“Moreover, to show his commitment to Nigeria’s economic growth and general welfare, he has been paying his UK doctor in naira and not pounds or dollars. Though his trips are for the good of the nation, as a staunch people advocate, the president does not believe they must be at the detriment of our foreign reserves.”

Trump invites Buhari to White House ‘to show Americans he isn’t that bad’,https://punocracy.com/trump-invites-buhari-to-white-house-to-show-americans-he-isnt-that-bad/,2018-05-01T06:18:16+01:00,"WASHINGTON D.C. (The T.A. Report) — Donald Trump, president of the United States, sources have said, invited President Muhammadu Buhari to the White House with the aim of boosting his public approval.
As his approval ratings continue to drop, sources within the White House told our correspondent that the historic invitation extended to Buhari may have been an attempt “to show Americans he isn’t that bad as a leader”.
“Trump is currently one of the most unpopular presidents of the world. His approval rating of 42 percent in April dropped even further to 36 percent in May, and many of us think he genuinely hopes the visit of Nigeria’s president may help reverse that trend at least a bit,” a source close to the president said.
“That is what his showdown with the North Korean leader too has been about. It was just a good-guy-versus-bad-guy script that was intended to polish him to people’s delight.”
Another source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity “because of the records of the people involved”, said the invitation became a matter of urgency following the recent visit of Emmanuel Macron, president of France, who dazzled Americans with his public speaking skills.
“When Macron visited, there were those who sarcastically suggested that a French-speaking man could speak even better English than the United States President. Hearing this, Trump asked the Secretary of State who the worst-speaking world-leader is, and the name Buhari stood out prominently,” he said.
“’Invite him! Invite him!’ the president had urged,” he added. “He argued that if they both speak side-by-side, perhaps Americans will see him as the fine orator that he is.”

Senator Dino Melaye has a bright prospect of becoming a Nollywood Superstar,https://punocracy.com/senator-dino-melaye-has-a-bright-prospect-of-becoming-a-nollywood-superstar/,2018-04-25T11:34:14+01:00,"ABUJA (THE B.O REPORT) –Senator Dino Melaye has been taunted as the next star in the money-spinning Nigeria entertainment industry. The Senator, who represents Kogi West Senatorial District, has been at the centre of many controversies in recent time.
His media aide, Gideon Ayodele, made this known to B.O Report in a press release on Wednesday morning.
“Senator Dino is a great dramatist. He is bold. He sings well. He has the power to take the Nollywood industry by storm. I believe his recent showdown with the Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS) is to, again, affirm the passion he has for drama and show the talents he’s got! In fact, I’m sure any prospect seen in the latest megabuck winner of Big Brother Naija [Miracle Ikechukwu] has been cast in doubt.
“For a person to do so much in real life fictional movies are no big deal. You will see; Dino will do to the world of entertainment what ‘Dinho did to Brazilian football. Because he hasn’t been lazy to show his forte, I think he deserves an accolade.”
When asked about the criticism that people might whip the Senator with, Ayodele brushed it aside, describing it as “their headache”.
“It is certain that people will bad mouth this ambition. That is their headache. Where were they when Desmond Eliot, a top actor, won a seat to represent Surulere Constituency in Lagos? Even our ever-tweeting Senator Ben Murray Bruce was he not a showbiz icon before becoming a Senator? What’s wrong with Senator Dino going in the other direction?” He said amidst a thunderous round of applause from fans.
A fan present at the press release that identified himself as Loyalist Dino said people have not appreciated the talents of his “superhero” well enough.
“He is my superhero! See, Oga Reporter, he is a man of many parts. He is multitalented – he sings beautifully, dances well, speaks well, and he has action. What else do you need to make a name for yourself? His brilliance, at times, gives me feel goosebumps.
“I believe he just wants to see off his Senatorial career before he hits the entertainment industry. I’m sure when eventually does, Kunle Afolayan, Odunlade Adekola, Ramsey Noah, Davido, Adekunle Gold and even Kaffy will all trail his light.”
Attempts to reach Dino Melaye himself were foiled by the doctors at the Zanklin Hospital, Mabushi, Abuja, who said he needed enough rest “to get ready for the tasks ahead.”

"We should all be feminists, Hallelujah!",https://punocracy.com/we-should-all-be-feminists-hallelujah/,2018-04-25T06:54:57+01:00,"She calls herself a feminist. She claims she campaigns for equality of rights and the same treatment for both sexes. She, like millions of others who have caught the wave, declared that not only can women do what men do, but that they ought to do what men do. As if the garb of feminism wasn’t enough, she calls herself a Christian too. But is she normal at all?
A highly revered religious scholar once aired (forgive my loose quotation of his words): There is nothing we would not see under the sun when the world is about to come to an end. One of those beautifully queer things we have been warned to expect is the feminism in religious garb. It is becoming more fierce by the day. But the question: is it normal at all? Of course, I tell you it is! In fact, it is our salvation in this inglorious time! Hallelujah!
You see, feminism is an ideological movement that has been sanctioned by the church and its holy book. Any part of the Holy Book that goes against it must be expunged. This is the world. Feminism is of the world. The Church and its Holy Book are of the world to come. We should silence the call of the world to come and heed the call of the current one. Hallelujah!
Feminism is a wonderfully fantabulous ideology. In fact, one of its proponents had once declared: we should all be feminists. Men should be femini-lized and women should be masculinized. Without feminism, there is no heaven! Hallelujah! And I even got into a discussion with a feminist and she arrogantly said: feminists are the best of humans! Hallelujah! You’re not a feminist? You had better go and wash your head in the ocean. You do not subscribe to it? You had better go and use shea-butter to rub your yansh. So you may be saved. Hallelujah!
Feminists do not poke their noses into other people’s affairs. They do not care if you choose to be a housewife, or you choose to be wife of your job. They do not care about how humans value different things and admire different values and aspire to different things — a topnotch housewife being one of those. In fact, they do not even care about the fact that a man has the right to how he chooses to run his home, and the right of the wife to choose how she wants to be a part of that. For those reasons, feminists are the wisest humans on earth! Hallelujah!
Verily verily I tell you that they are wiser than Aristotle and Plato and Marcus Aurelius and every philosopher who has ever lived. In fact, they are wiser than all the religions’ founders combined! What is more is that they are even wiser than you and I and everyone else on the matters of our lives! Hallelujah! Those philosophers and religions’ founders didn’t even concern themselves that much with women issues anyways. Hallelujah!
Feminism is the way to go, if you want to be intellectually myopic, and stupidly wise. Oh sorry! If you want to be intellectually sound and fantastically wise, I meant to type. Feminism is the way to go if you do not open your eyes to the liberty of humans to choose. In fact, all of us should be feminists, and we should start looking for troubles where there are none. Hallelujah!
And the best, we should be feminists that still want to make heaven by holding contradictory beliefs and silencing some parts of the holy books of the different — especially the two largest world’s — religions that we profess. So, all of us should be feminists. And all of us should be busy confusing ourselves. Hallelujah!"

His second wife, Alero Melaye, told the T.A. Report that he has not been the same after finally watching the record-breaking movie over the weekend.
“You know Dino is naturally a dramatic man. But his condition worsened after he watched that film called Black Panther at least four times on Saturday and Sunday,” she said.
“Since then, he has been shouting ‘glory to hanuman!’ and ‘wakanda forever!’ in the house. He thinks he is living the life of one superhero. I told him to snap out of it, but all my attempts to restore sanity have proved futile. You are a great singer, dancer and comedian, I told him, but don’t think you have superhuman abilities.
“When the police surrounded the house, he said I shouldn’t worry that he has just ordered a vibranium suit from Amazon, and his boys were on the way. So I was not really surprised when I heard he later jumped from the van to escape from arrest.”
One of the security operatives present at the scene also said he suspected something was off when the senator crossed his arms to form an ‘x’ at the point of arrest.
“When we told him to freeze and submit himself willingly for arrest, the senator refused to extend his hands,” he said. “Instead, he crossed them like a Wakandan and shouted at us, ‘I never freeze!’”
Unfortunately for him, Melaye could not sustain the script as he became immobilised immediately following the jump and could not leave with his supporters as planned. Reports have it that he has been admitted and is now recovering speedily at Zanklin Hospital, Mabushi, Abuja.

A conversation with my mechanic who wants to be president │Reuben Abati,https://punocracy.com/conversation-with-my-mechanic-who-wants-to-be-president-%e2%80%95-by-reuben-abati/,2018-04-24T11:31:18+01:00,"This is an extract from a longer piece published by The Cable and titled, “2019: Nigeria’s Emerging Political Leaders“.Reuben Abatiis a columnist and former Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Goodluck Jonathan.
…He [my mechanic] came to see me the other day, full of excitement.
“Oga, it’s you I have come to see oh.” Typical Nigerian manner of speaking: you are right in front of me, and yet you still consider it necessary to announce your presence. Anyhow, I nodded affirmatively, already working out a response to a likely solicitation for money. It is school resumption time, and it is usual for people to go soliciting for help to pay children’s school fees in a country where basic education is so unaffordable.
“Oga, I have come to inform you that I am thinking of running for President.” I thought the guy was talking about the Presidency of the Mechanics Village Association. So, I brightened up. No, he meant President of Nigeria. I removed my eyeglasses and dropped my pen.
“President of Nigeria? How? Look, have you been drinking?”
“Oga, you know I am a Christian. I don’t drink. I am serious oh. I have been thinking about it for a while. I can do a better job. The way these people are running Nigeria, some of us have good ideas about what can be done. If we leave this Nigeria to these politicians, they will finish all of us. Anybody that likes this country should get involved.”
I paid attention to him.
“Oga, look at me, I can do it. We can do it. I have worked it out. By the grace of God, I will be the next President of Nigeria.”
I had known this mechanic for a while, but I never suspected he had very tall ambitions. I had not yet given him my honest opinion; he had already conscripted me. “We can do it”. We? Every Nigerian politician is an optimist, and the most optimistic are often the ones who don’t even stand a chance at the polls.
I pretended to be interested all the same; so he continued with his campaign.
“Oga, you know me. Am I a lazy man? No. I am not.” When people insist on answering their own questions the best you can do in the circumstance is to listen.
“What this country needs now is a mechanic, somebody who can take a look at a vehicle that is having problems, and fix it. We mechanics do that every day. When they bring a car to you, first you diagnose. What is wrong with the car? Why is it not functioning well, and then you go straight to the problem and fix it. Why can’t people fix Nigeria? If we mechanics were to behave like politicians, this whole country will be littered with broken down vehicles. In the hands of these politicians, Nigeria is broken. E be like say Nigeria don knock engine sef. I am the man who will fix that engine.”
“But nobody will give you any chance. Everybody will laugh and think you are joking.”
“I am not joking, Oga. What does it take to be President? I have done my homework. The only thing they are asking for is a WAEC certificate. I have my certificate ready and I can produce it to prove that I completed secondary school.”
“How many credits?”, I asked, trying to humour him.
“INEC does not ask for five credits. Even F9 parallel sef can be President of Nigeria. No be Nigeria?”
“But you don’t have the resources. You’d need a lot of money.”
“Oga, it is not about money. And if it is money, God will provide. Our Pastor in our church has been praying for me and God is speaking to us. When I become President, I will declare free education, free health and there will no lazy youth in Nigeria again!”
“Why don’t you start at a lower level. may be local government chairman, gain some experience.”
“Ha. Oga, Experience has shown that in Nigerian politics you don’t need experience. Who has experience helped? All those former Governors in the National Assembly, what kind of experience do they have? In fact, let me just say a lot of them go there to sleep and collect free money, travel free. I have seen their pictures. They go there to sleep. When some thugs stormed the place to steal the Mace, not one of them could stand up and protect the Mace. Lazy Senators. Only a woman, a sergeant at arms was courageous enough to challenge the Mace thieves. When I am President, nobody will dare steal the Mace. It won’t happen.”
I felt like telling him that there has been too much drama over the significance of the Mace in our legislatures. It is at best a ceremonial symbol. For a session of the legislature to be valid under the 1999 Constitution what is required is a quorum as defined under Section 54, but of course the kind of criminal conduct that was put up at the Senate, last week, is condemnable and should be investigated and all authors of that act of impunity must be sanctioned accordingly.
I didn’t say anything to him along these lines, rather I was more impressed by his passion, his determination to save Nigeria and arrest the drift. I was also struck by the fact that he is not the only Nigerian with such passion. There have been many of his kind, now active on social media, promoting a vision of Nigeria and insisting that they would be better materials for 2019.
The number of these aspiring Presidents keeps increasing everyday and while I consider some of their posters a bit curious and the candidates a bit unusual, taken together, the shared anxiety about the Presidency and who is best fit to lead Nigeria beyond 2019 says a lot about public expectations. There are online, video-tapes of a certain Aunty Monica, for example.
She is based in Europe and she wants to come home to be President, to bring investment and tourism to the country, and she says she has “ideas in her head.” I have also seen such banners as “Vote Iya Bayo for president, Aunti Ramota for Vice President”, and “PFANN: A new refreshing wind blowing over the nation. Get ready. Elishama 2019.”"
"I am actually running for CAN President, campaign committee made mistake ― says Durotoye",https://punocracy.com/i-am-actually-running-for-can-president-campaign-committee-made-mistake-durotoye/,2018-04-24T06:43:33+01:00,"LAGOS (The T.A. Report) — Fela Durotoye has apologised to Nigerians for his misleading campaign, which has so far portrayed him as a 2019 presidential aspirant.
He disclosed in a statement, released on Monday throughhis websiteand Facebook page, that he is in truth running for the presidency of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), currently headed by Revd. Supo Ayokunle.
He also blamed his “overzealous” campaign committee for the “unfortunate misrepresentation of facts”, and promised to be more straightforward in his campaign slogans and statements.
“Fellow Nigerians, it has come to my notice that many of you wrongly believe I am standing for presidency come 2019. This is far from reality. I have no such aspirations, whether for next year or the next five years,” the statement read.
“My campaign committee, filled with ambitious and sometimes overzealous young men and women, must have desired otherwise. And I am truly sorry for this misrepresentation of facts. My intention, from the start, has really been to succeed Revd. Ayokunle as the president of the Christian Association of Nigeria.
“I have observed with melancholy the way and manner in which the body has been administered over the years, and my father eventually revealed to me in 2016 that it is time to do something about it. God told me in unequivocal terms that it is time I lived up to my name –duro ti oye(stand up to title). I am simply respecting the wishes of the almighty.
“So, fellow Nigerians, it is time we come to the ken that CAN needs our help, and we can! In this light, my new campaign slogan is “we can for CAN!” We must not retire until we cast Holy Ghost fire and make all the liars and enemies of progress perspire.
“And, of course, we should never forget that your attitude and state of gratitude will in the end determine your altitude and latitude; because you will never deserve some accolades until all your dues have been fully paid.”
Durotoye has been in the hot seat for constantly playing a God card in his speeches and campaign statements. Among other things, he had said he will “carry God on my head” and that it is time Nigerians “bring God back into politics”.

FACTCHECK: Are Nigerian youth lazy as Buhari claimed? ― YES!,https://punocracy.com/factcheck-are-nigerian-youth-lazy-as-buhari-claimed-%e2%80%95-yes/,2018-04-22T09:06:41+01:00,"[Okay, maybe fact check isn’t exactly the word I’m looking for… but read on anyway]
So it has been one scandal after another for Sai Baba in the past week, creating a big window for disgruntled folks to jump into conjectures and conclusions ― as usual. The one that stands out like Mr President when he is flanked by the governor of Kaduna, former governor of Edo or perhaps his professorial deputy, is the issue of lazy Nigerian youth. By Allah, baba is really patient. The fact that no one has gone to jail yet despite all that has happened and been said shows that he has been truly democratised. No doubt, the head that wears a crown must also occasionally wear a frown.
They say they said he said Nigerians are lazy, without first confirming from the footage. But, of course, he did not say that. He only said a lot of young Nigerians sit at home, sow nothing, while expecting bountiful harvests. But, hey, even if he said the youth are lazy, how is that even a problem? Is it not true? Let me tell you, the first confirmation that you are all lazy is that you even have the time to react to Mr President’s statements on the social media.
Or is it from your workplaces that you have been typing rants and epistles on Facebook and Twitter? If you all really have jobs, you won’t even know your President is in London – let alone that he said so and so about you. Joke is on you, people.
Some jobless people even went ahead to make T-Shirts out of the saga. I am sure they gave the contract to their friends in China who produce beautiful shirts. Surely, no Nigerian youth is capable of such sophisticated industry. Even those who blogged about it are all jobless! Linda Ikeji and the rest of them. Who doesn’t know blogging is what lazy, unemployed people use to while away time and express their lazy thoughts. Mtcheew.
When Mr President contested in 2015 and he saw how millions of young Nigerians trooped out for his campaigns and how they occupied the social media to ensure he becomes victorious, it was then he realised how massive the problem is. All those young Nigerians who campaigned vigorously for him are lazy. If not, they would have concentrated on their works instead. I am sure they in fact supported him because he promised to give them free N5000 monthly stipends. Nigerians! All they want is free money.
Take a look at the Nigerian youth who “trekked for Buhari” in 2015. Take a look at the Buharists and their counterparts on the social media and places like Nairaland. Take a look at the Al-Majiris in Mr President’s local government. Take a look at those scamming the N-Power scheme. Take a look at government workers who do nothing from dawn to dusk, yet shout like the Jabari tribesmen when salary is delayed by a week.
Take a look at those who stole the mace from the Senate only to deposit it under a flyover bridge the next day. Take a look at the young person next to you. In fact, take a look at yourself ― no, no, look again. What are you presently doing? Now, tell me we are all not lazy.
If I had a job, you think I will have time to write the previous 500 words? Let us not kid ourselves, people. This is a country of lazy people. It is our culture, our way of living. It is how we thrive. It is what makes us who we are – Nigerians. Even Mr President, upright has he is, has got infected somehow. If you did not know, Twitter was inspired by a lazy Nigerian youth, who thought writing long articles was too much work. I can’t remember his name now. Today, the most active users of the platform are none but lazy Nigerians ― having hashtags for breakfast, savage subs for lunch, and for whom shaking innocent tables in the best exercise in the world.
Nigerians are so lazy they have been shouting, “I deserve some accolades! I paid my dues! I deserve some accolades!” up and down, whereas even house rent and tax they have not paid. There is one youth who, every damn day, goes to the social media to say “somethn’ just happen right now”, and he says he is employed.
Yet, there is another one who has been carrying the same bag and wearing the same white shirt and tie for more than three years. He is busy venting his anger up and down instead of finding a good job. Truth be told, it’s like even Boko Haram boys have become lazy, though thanks to God for that one ― and, not to forget, to Mr President too.
If Nigerian youth are not lazy, they should prove it by getting their PVCs and voting next year. But, I am sure, they cannot even muster the strength to do that. You will see. It is only shout we know how to shout. Maybe when Mr President said we only sit at home, he was even referring metaphorically to the social media ― the new home of the Nigerian young folk."
"“The mace wasn’t stolen, it was only part of a legislative exercise” – Saraki tells Nigerians",https://punocracy.com/the-mace-wasnt-stolen-it-was-only-a-part-of-a-legislative-exercise-saraki-tells-nigerians/,2018-04-19T07:30:49+01:00,"The Senate President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Bukola Saraki has gone to Twitter to express his displeasure at how Nigerians misconstrued a nationalexercise ­by Nigerian senators on Wednesday, April 18, 2019.
He expressed himself thus:“It is part of the NASS culture to organize an assembly program that will unite all senators in a power run. The 7thassembly did a hurdle race in which they jumped fences in 2014, this is our own exercise. It’s a pass the mace relay race.”

Senate President Saraki, who was in Washington at the time of the exercise, expressed his grief over his absenteeism. He told journalists in America during a mini press briefing shortly after the incidence that he “wishes to be a part of it, but he had other errands to run for the country.I would like fellow patriotic Nigerians to relax, the mace wasn’t stolen, it was only a part of a legislative exercise.
He has however expressed his displeasure at how the media has been calling Senator Ovie Omo-Agege a thug. “He was only being patriotic,”the Senate President added.
The spokesperson for the Nigerian President, Mr Femi Adesina also expressed the President’s opinion in a media release this morning. The release read,“Nigerian youths need to learn from our senators. They might be old, but they are shining examples of leadership and athleticism. Learn from Abuja and Edo.”The Edo state parliament had also yesterday engulfed in fisticuffs while trying to impeach the Speaker, in a friendly exercise yesterday. The honourable members had emulated Anthony Joshua by choosing to be boxers in their little physical exercise.
The media has been awash with various stories of how the Senators and Honourable members are bad eggs to the young people of Nigeria. Our reporter gathered however that the opposite is the case. In a statement released by Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, now titled theMace runner,he mentioned that “we need to play with ourselves every now and then. The mace running had nothing to do with my suspension. I, in fact, came to participate in the spirit of sportsmanship. I appreciate the efforts of Senator Sheu Sanni who gave the house his waist belt to use when one of my men ran beyond the finish line with the mace.
“He had probably forgotten that we were supposed to return it.”About his subsequent arrest, Senator Ovie mentioned that “when you win in Olympics, they take you away from the pitch to dress you up for eventual medal presentation, which was what happened.”

"SHOCKING: 100 rich, talented men look on as unarmed thieves steal expensive wood",https://punocracy.com/shocking-100-rich-talented-men-look-on-as-unarmed-thieves-steal-expensive-wood/,2018-04-19T07:13:51+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) — The country was left in shock on Wednesday after a group of five unarmed men stole a very expensive wood from Red Chambers, Nigeria’s senior federal legislative house.
The wood, it was gathered, represents the house’s symbol of authority and gives it power to make laws. It was thus shocking when nearly one hundred rich, highly skilled men and women, members of the house, looked on helplessly as the wood was carted away by the common thieves. Their security guards, more than twice their number, also could not salvage the situation.
The 100 men, reports say, are one of the most well-paid government officials in the world. They have also been known to have skills in fence-jumping, kickboxing, furniture-hurling, and acrobatic dancing. In the house, in fact, is a renowned PhD holder in the Science of Commonsense. Yet, many looked on while some took to their heels during the daring operation.
It is not clear if the thugs made use of black magic to spellbind the Senators, though experts have suggested this to be the case.
While a report said the stolen wood has now been placed for sale on OLX, an online trading platform, other reports say it has been found under a flyover bridge in the Federal Capital Territory. One of the two objects, an insider at the National Assembly told The T.A. Report, must have been forged overnight.

Nigerian village people confess to supporting Buhari’s second term bid,https://punocracy.com/nigerian-village-people-confess-to-supporting-buharis-second-term-bid/,2018-04-17T04:00:01+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) — The Association of Village People of Nigeria (AVPN) has confessed to endorsing President Buhari’s re-election agenda.
It said this in a statement released on Monday, which was signed by its National President, Dr Lasisi Alaran. The statement reported that, after its 92nd Annual General Meeting held in March, the association resolved that Muhammadu Buhari is the perfect candidate to keep Nigeria the way it is.
“We have monitored the political landscape closely for a long time. We have studied all the candidates, and we honestly think Buhari is, in all ramifications, the worst of them all. That is why he has our full support,” the statement read.
“He has all it takes to become Nigeria’s President ― money, popularity, and money. But more importantly, he has all it takes to keep Nigeria the way it is ― insecure, confused, and undeveloped. In our nearly 100 years of existence as an association, we have not seen a more perfect candidate.
“It is because of this we communicated to the President that we support him having a second tenure. We suspect Mr President was referring to us when he said Nigerians appreciate his administration and are clamouring for his return.”
The association also urged President Buhari to get another running mate in 2019, advising against the choice of Professor Yemi Osinbajo.
“As much as we admire the achievements of this administration, we believe Professor Osinbajo has injected too much sanity into the Presidential Villa, and that is more good to the country than we can bear,” it said.
“We recommend that the President runs with Adamu Adamu, the Minister of Education. And if he is bent on having a Yoruba deputy (we already know the 5% people are a no-no), then there is perhaps no better man for the job than Adebayo Shittu of Oyo state. He is indeed one of our very talented ambassadors.
“We wish President Buhari all the best till 2023, and we urge all Nigerians to vote for him as he has all it takes to move Nigeria (backwards). Hopefully, by the time our great association is celebrating her 100 years anniversary in 2026, it will be with a toast to Nigeria getting crowned as the most failed state of the world. We shall get there.”

Great Ife! Great Ife
Africa’s most beautiful campus
Conscious, vigilant, progressive
Aluta against all oppression…
Another great Ife is a counterfeit…”

Student leader:Ever articulate gbagba! Ever militant gbogbo! Greatest gbagba gbogbo…

(Bursts into an office, panting)
Professor Ajanlekoko:Ha! Professor Dick, there’s fire on the mountain! I drove past Awo Hall just now and I saw highly charged students clutching cudgels, ready for mass protest. They’re calling for the head of Professor Dauda! This thing is getting out of hand! Ha! And I always warned Dauda that girls with crazy curvatures are volatile. That’s why I go for pregnant and married students only! How do we clear this mess now?
Professor Dick:The situation is unfortunate. As for me, I only go for the willing ones; many of the girls out there are brainless and poor, so they’re gladly ready to roll in the hay with you. God will take control, sha. I’ve told Prof Amu to use his contacts and appeal to the students. Hasn’t Amu got across to the students?
Prof Shoki:You can’t fully trust anybody in this matter! Some lecturers are happy that this is happening to Dauda, a leading figure in our camp…as if they too don’t eat biscuit bone.
(Dick cuts in sharply):Stop calling Prof Richie, Dauda! Call him by his real name! Dauda the Sexy Guy was only a nickname he got about 25 years ago when he impregnated his secretary and her three daughters. The woman pursued him to his Ikire home, stripped naked and cursed him. I suspect Prof Jack, Prof Sting and co. are the ones pushing this girl.
Ajanlekoko:I suggest we continue to refer to him as Prof Dauda because we don’t even know if this office is bugged or not. As an expert in law, I know what I’m talking about. Let’s not call him by his real name, let’s continue to call him Dauda.
Shoki:Ok, I get your point, Ajanlekoko. Let’s stick to Dauda then. Has anybody spoken to him? I’ve been trying to get him since the news went viral this morning. His phone is switched off. I can’t imagine how’s going to face his wife, children and his church, where he’s the second-in-command to the bishop.
Dick:Let’s forget about the family matter for now! Let’s address this immediate crisis! I’ve been inundated with calls from the media, the police, the NDLEA…
Shoki:NDLEA? Why is the NDLEA looking for him?
Dick:They said they want to test him for hard drugs.
Shoki:Hard drugs? Why?
Dick:Because he said he was going to play five matches and potentially score 25 goals.
Shoki:I don’t understand.
Dick:But you listened to the audio now. Didn’t you hear him say he was going to play five solid matches? Knowing him for his killer instinct in front of goal, he would find the net five times during each match, and that makes a tally of 25 goals!
Shoki:Jeez! How could Dauda implicate himself like this? Even Messi and Ronaldo combined aren’t that deadly. This is what I’ve always said; how could you demand five matches for just seven marks? The foolish girl scored 33 marks and he said he was only going to give her seven more marks to make a pass mark of 40. So, why demand five matches? He should’ve played a friendly match and moved on. How can you play European Championship League in only one stadium? I guess that was why the girl refuse.”
Ajanlekoko:Can you believe I was eyeing this little girl, too? Her name is Eni. It’s God that saved me o. Is this how this final year student would have dabarued my life as she’s dabaruing Dauda’s life at 62 years of age? Can you imagine that this wayward girl admitted in the audio that she has a boyfriend? Is that what her parents sent her to school to do?
Dick:Do you want to hear the truth, comrades? Dauda should’ve known the mad girl was setting him up when she was mentioning his name repeatedly. Me, I don’t talk to any of my takeaways on the phone. I use a dedicated email. If any problem arises, I’ll deny. That’s how I escaped when that busty girl, Cossy, wrote the university Senate, alleging that I was demanding sex from her. Nothing came out of the senate inquiry! I just got some boys to subtly threaten her while I engage some girls to give her money. She never showed up at the senate inquiry!
Shoki:Really? You’re lucky. (Please, let me pick this call) Hello, who’s this? Ehn?! Who? Ha! Dauda! But this isn’t your number? Where’re you…? In your driver’s house? Where’s that in Ife? Moore? We’re at our off-campus secretariat in Moore, too. Text the address to me and I’ll come and fetch you immediately. Don’t leave the house o. Students are looking for you. I’ll be there in five minutes… Comrades, let me go and pick Dauda, he’s down the road.
Ajanlekoko:Ok. Please, be careful on the way; those students are very angry. (Shoki exits)
Dick:After this heat, Dauda should just retire.
Ajanlekoko:But he has eight more years to retirement?
Dick:His rod and staff need a rest. He should use the remaining years of his life to beg God for forgiveness.
(Knock)
Ajanlekoko:I think they’re back. Please, open the door for them.
(The office suddenly becomes agitated as Dauda sneaks in disguised like a woman. He removes his wig, blouse, bra, skirt, earrings, goggles and lipstick)
(Sweating, Dauda clears his throat)“Thank you, my people. The enemies will fail in Jesus name…”
Lecturers:“Amen!”
Dauda:I fled the campus barefooted this early morning after listening to the evil audio. I changed my line when calls and texts messages nearly ran me mad. My wife and daughters have been calling me all day. One of my three pets in the church choir texted, calling me a wicked man; she said I was destroying other people’s daughters while I ensured my daughters got married as virgins. My Lord Bishop has been calling, too.
(More of his colleagues offer words of sympathy)
Shoki:As a professor of law, let me give a legal perspective to the audio recording.
Dauda:Please, do.
Shoki:Ok. To start with, you must deny that you ever spoke to that girl. When going to appear before the senate, take along with you one or two Indian films wherein the actors spoke Yoruba. You’ll play the film before the senate, and show that if technology could make Indians speak Yoruba, technology could make your enemies speak in your voice. Comrades, we have to destroy the audio evidence with legal technicalities.
Dauda:What if she comes up with fresh evidence?
Shoki:That’s why we should appeal to the emotions of her parents; that they shouldn’t allow her kill your career. We should beg them with real money. We’ll appeal to them to pressure her not to appear before the senate panel. If she doesn’t appear, you’re in the clear. You’re lucky the Federal Government is busy with re-election now.
Dauda:What if she refuses?
Shoki:Then, you’ll need to go to Jebako.
Dauda:What for?
Shoki:To see Baba Kokonsari Iponri Iku, the great juju man! He’ll cage the senseless girl.
Dauda:But many people know me in Jebako, I can’t go there to do juju again. May be I should call the girl?
Ajanlekoko:Oh! Ok, call her.
(Dauda prostates on the floor)“I hope she picks my call. (Pause) It’s ringing…God, let her pick it …Ah! Aunty Eni, bawo ni, ma? Ma, it’s me, Prof. Em, em, I’m begging you ni, ma. I’m flat on the floor, ma!… Ha! She’s cut the line! Aye mi, t’emi bami!

Why the increase in UI fees is a ‘wise’ decision,https://punocracy.com/why-the-increase-in-ui-fees-is-a-wise-decision/,2018-04-16T18:23:43+01:00,"The stakes were high. The race for what to write was more competitive than that between the sperm cells that eventually formed me. Too many things to talk about. Unibadan is raining hell; halls have been beheaded. The University has been churning out brilliant ideas; the latest being the meeting invitation to Parent and Guardian which reminds us of the good old days of PTA in high school. The management has ‘wisely’ breastfed medical students with peak milk, and now there fees are ‘reaching for the peak’. Protests everywhere. Resumption is as uncertain as tomorrow. In fact, UI currently boils.
Although, the choices were almost endless, the mother of them all is the hike in price. It stands out as a sore thumb would. Much as it has received weeklong stern opposition, it is time to take a breather. Because the management, whose members ate chicken and had their clothes drycleaned by our founding fathers in the yore years of their undergraduate, has, once again, shown one of the most thoughtful means of generating internal revenue. They have shown yet again that, among them, commonsense is as common as snow in Sahara Desert.
The hike in fees ought to have been more. Remember the saying that if you think education is expensive try ignorance. The school quiet understands this saying that is why an increase was inevitable. Out of the benevolent heart of our academic parents, they heeded the advice of Bill Gates to the Nigerian government that, the government should invest in the people. In their most brilliant smartness, they interpreted the billionaire’s words as making the people (who, here, are the students) to pay more. Give it to them.
Also, because the Nigerian people hardly trust innovative discoveries from our schools, the management had to look for an alternative udder to milk from. The school has reached a stage when the intellectual community finds it tough to sell its wit. Researches from the grey matter of our academic heavyweights, sadly, no longer matter because they are birthed on paper, they live on paper and die nowhere else.
The only time their lifespan is altered is when la cram la pour geniuses come calling on them. In fact, merely to erect a transformer in the school, a certain Ajadi, who is a technician from Agbowo, has to be hired. You may care to ask: where are our engineers? Well, they will supervise him. Fair deal? Now tell me, in a situation whereby we pay for what we know and equally do not sell what we have, how do we make a fortune? You, the students, are the next open cheque and trust them, you can’t escape it.
Again, let us examine the state of UI Ventures together. Remember the business treasure trove tucked in the textbook for GES 301 – Introduction to Entrepreneurial Skills? The 137-paged book, a compendium of anything business – from innovations for business success to financial planning and management, from feasibility studies to legal issues and so on – is a product of the school. Yet, the school businesses cannot find the product between this product of its and the business it owns. As a matter of fact, saying it can’t find the product is an overstatement.
Even a sum is a cold day hell. Therefore, because internally generated revenue is direly needed, and UI bread is like stiffened television casing, and UI water is better for washing than it is for drinking, and UI farm is not a big market for the school and its environ, and UI hotel has no evidence that a certain Department of Wildlife and Ecotourism exists, then the searchlight has to be beamed elsewhere. And to you is the sure bet. Thank your star that it is still within the bracket of 1-100 thousand upsurge. It could have been more!
Let me also add that, the increment, particularly in accommodation is for your good. Some of the things that hurt the drivers of the school’s affairs are situations that “de-market” the school or “impugn our integrity and abuse us at the slightest provocation of students” or public demonstrations that force the head to mouth: “they are disgracing us”. They neither want to be disgraced nor de-marketed (whatever that means) nor their hard earned integrity be impugned; hence, the increment.
Trust them, again because of that much treasured integrity, you won’t pay more to get less. If not totally 114% refurbishment, at least you will get 100% renovation to your Halls. See, the increment is a giant stride in the bid to transform the half-star vestiges in UI Halls of Residence to at least four-and-half-star (because the initial half will not be thrown away) habitations. Please don’t take my words to the bank; bank on their integrity.
Need I mention another reason the move is a smart one? Tell me how many of you pay as low as fourteen thousand outside and get as much as you get in the Halls? You pay more outside and yet you get lesser than the school offers. Still you complain! Isn’t that hypocrisy? Well, whatever it is, the school is not making profit as it ought to from its businesses, its wits are not generating revenue as you would expect; in spite of this, you kept enjoying subsidy. But not any longer. No more subsidy. Even on the national scene, oil subsidy has been itself halted few years back. It is a simple  analogy of, when the best is not available the available becomes the best.
To close, now that the cost of living in the school is more than the cost of schooling there, what does that imply? How did we get to the stage where we, the gown, supplies neither brainpower nor manpower to the town? How come we teach students to be brilliant entrepreneurs yet our businesses are being strangled by the torpid fist of incompetence? Why do we claim we have integrity more than we show that we truly do? Isn’t an institution’s learning power its earning power? How come ours is different? Does that mean we teach more and we learn less? Or we don’t learn at all? The clue is certainly in between the two options.
So let whoever has ears listen. These words are for the wise to chew and ruminate over – not just those who claim to be wise but those who truly are. Let the wise pick that which belong to them, let them chew it, swallow it and let it digest and mend the errors in the system. I’m munching my own already. And for those who are too wise to learn let them die of constipation. I’ve said my own. Verbum sap!

"‘I promised change, so why can’t I change my mind?’ ― asks Buhari",https://punocracy.com/i-promised-change-so-why-cant-i-change-my-mind-%e2%80%95-asks-buhari/,2018-04-16T00:23:59+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) — President Muhammadu Buhari has explained that his promise of change also involves the right to change his mind and laments the backlash that followed his declaration of desire to re-contest.
He stated this is in a series of tweets on Monday, posted through his personal account, @MBuhari. In one tweet, he challenged “naysayers” to go to court if they really think he has done something wrong.
“The contract I signed with Nigerians is that of change. I said it clearly and repeatedly during my campaign in 2015, so I do not know what the problem is now,” he wrote.
“Someone should explain to me why I can’t change my mind after promising change?” he asked. “I can change the country, but cannot change my mind? Isn’t that unfair?”
“Some naysayers from the PDP are saying I breached my contract with Nigerians, but I think they should take their arguments to the court of law if they really have a point,” he said in another Tweet.


Shortly after the tweets were posted, Tolu Ogunlesi (@toluogunlesi), on the same platform, also blasted “those who are not happy with Nigeria’s progress”.
“I don’t know what’s wrong with some brutes without PVC who think they have a say in national politics,” he tweeted. “Nigeria has greatly improved under this administration and it is generous of Mr President to want to continue despite the toll on his health.”
“I think those who are not happy with Nigeria’s progress should are free to pack their things and leave,” he added. “Thanks to Mr President, the North is now safer as a gateway to the Mediterranean sea.”
Meanwhile, Naomi Barbara has congratulated President Buhari and said her organisation is warming up to confer on him a newly introduced MLK Award of Meritorious Service during the Black History Month in 2019.

A Play of Two Cities: When the Nigerian President Travels,https://punocracy.com/a-play-of-two-cities-when-the-nigerian-president-travels/,2018-04-10T06:54:56+01:00,"Act One, Scene One
It is a sanitised clime. Here, common sense is a common commodity – used by the leaders in leading, deployed by the led in demanding for better leadership. Settling quietly at the heart of the city is the office of the President. Modest for a place that houses the first family in a nation of 200 million minds. It is surrounded by a handful of guards and a see-through gate. In the innermost office is President Sankara, the businessman, philanthropist and activist turned president. He had won the election the previous year by a landslide. Through the thick lenses of his eyeglasses, he pores through a thick document on his desk. With a red pen, he crosses out certain items and reduces some other figures. Boldly written on the document are the words: “2019 National Appropriation Bill”.
His phone suddenly rings. Swiftly, he picks up the holder. He’s been expecting it. On the other end is his Aide de Camp.
ADC:Mr President.
Sankara:Youssef, how’re you doing?
ADC:Very well sir… Mr President, on your scheduled visit to the Kanda Province, I’m just calling to ask how you want to go about it… The Governor too is on the line.
Governor:Good day, Mr President. We can’t wait to host you in Kanda in the coming week. In fact, my wife has ordered for ingredients with which to prepare your favourite delicacy.
Sankara:Ha-ha! Thank you, Your Excellency. Regards to your lovely wife.
Governor:Certainly sir.
ADC:The journey sir.
Sankara:Yes, I think I’ll just stick to the Business Class of our National Airlines as usual. I also would not like too much noise about this since we are only commissioning four rail networks, three housing estates, and one world-class university of science and technology. I don’t want my people to start asking if the president is jobless.
ADC:Oh, yes sir.
Governor:And Mr President, where would you like to be lodged during the four days? You know we house the only seven-star hotel in the country. We can make reservations as soon as …
Sankara:Oh no, dear governor. Asante sana! I want to use the period to spend time with my aging dad. He lives also close to the capital. We can always use a chopper to get to the launch sites, so as to cause minimal disruption in daily activities.
Governor:Alright then, Mr President. We’ll improve the security within that perimeter a day before your arrival.
Sankara:Thank you, brother.
ADC:Mr Governor, is there anything else you wish to confirm?
Governor:No, Youssef.
ADC:I guess that’ll be all then.
Sankara:Great! Have a good day, you two. And Youssef, don’t forget to see me by 10.
ADC:Yes, Mr President.
Sankara:Thank you. [Hangs up]. Now, back to this document…. How come the Ministry of Finance is getting so much for recurrent expenditures? Hmmm… Where’s this man…

Act Two, Scene One
It is a sanatorium. Here, common sense is as common as suya without pepper and square-shaped pizzas. The president’s office is the greatest highlight in a country of many miles and 180 million heads. So grand was the construction that an entirely new state was created for it in the bush. Surrounded by high walls and tough-looking armed men, it is not a place for common men, just as it also sieves out common sense and anything that resembles it. In the innermost office is President Wanmotam (one more time), popularly called Sai Baba. He has dozed off on his desk, understandably because this is one of the few moments he has to revitalise his aging bones. Just beneath his wrinkled face, dancing salsa with his rhythmic snore, is a document. Boldly written on it are the words, “2019 National Appropriation Bill”.
His phone suddenly rings. And, like one pursued from the dreamland by nightmarish umbrella-holders, he springs up. After six or seven seconds of face-rubbing, he manages to save the call from drowning into the missed calls log. On the other end is his loyal Aide de Camp.
ADC:Barka da asuba, Mr President! Ina kwana?
Wanmotam:Lafiya. Lafiya.
ADC:Mr President, the Governor of Lagos state is also on the line to finalise arrangements for you trip sir.
Governor:Good morning, Mr President. The industrious people of Lagos state cannot wait to welcome you to our beautiful city.
Wanmotam:I’m glad to hear that, Governor.
Governor:We have made reservations at the best hotel there is on the Island. In fact, we booked all the rooms for the entire four days, so that Mr President will suffer no disturbance in the slightest.
Wanmotam:Aaah! Good. You know I like a good sleep. Thank you, my governor.
Governor:We are also thinking of getting a customised Monster Truck to convey you to the launch sites, and to the hotel from the airport, Mr President. Or would you rather have a helicopter?
Wanmotam:No, no! I want to use my usual car. I want to be with my people on the streets. But please add ten more cars to the convoy. You know Lagos can be a very rowdy place. You don’t know who is who.
Governor:Of course, Mr President. We totally understand.
Wanmotam:What do you think about declaring one or two days work-free in my name too? I know you people love to work, unlike those of us in Abuja. But I don’t want people to remember my visit as the day they worked morning to night. Let them rest, and maybe have some time to come and wave at me.
Governor:Consider it done, Mr President.
Wanmotam:Excellent! You know that is why I say you are the only Your Excellency with a Centre of Excellence.
Governor:[chuckles] Thank you, Mr President.
ADC:Is there anything else left to be discussed, governor?
Governor:Well, yes… but it is not a matter for a phone call… ahem, when the President arrives, we will discuss it, especially if the First Lady won’t be able to make it.
Wanmotam:[Laughs hysterically, revealing his gap-tooth for the first time] Hahaha… this boy… of course, of course. You are a great host, my governor. My regards to your cabinet.
Governor:Yes, Mr President.
ADC:Have a great day, Governor.
Wanmotam:Goodbye, Bode.
Governor:Goodbye, Mr President.
Wanmotam:By the way, Lamidi, as soon as you’re done over there, come and pick up this budget, and give it to Prof. The first page alone is making me dizzy.
ADC:Okay, Mr President.
Wanmotam:Nagode. [hangs up]"
"UI students vow to go on hunger strike, lecture strike if increment in their fees is not rescinded",https://punocracy.com/ui-students-vow-to-go-on-hunger-strike-lecture-strike-if-the-increment-in-their-fees-is-not-rescinded/,2018-04-05T08:37:19+01:00,"Students of the University of Ibadan have vowed to fight back the recent increment in their fees with hunger and lecture strike. The students made this declaration to Yesterday’s Tomorrow’s Reporter, Bayode Otitokoro, in a recent congress held around the University axis.
“We have learnt our lesson. We have learnt that that protest is like a puff-puff punch on the skin of the management. This time around we won’t protest. We will go on hunger strike. We will boycott classes. By the time Jaja is flooded with malnourished patients the management will hear our moans,” a correspondent, who simply identified himself as Ola Yinka, challenged.
This reaction trails the 114% increase in the accommodation fee for residents in the undergraduate Halls of Residence as well as 186% for potential residents of Alexandra Brown Hall, UCH. While the former will now pay ₦30, 000, the latter have their price increased to ₦40, 000 – a price they paid ₦14, 000 for last session.
“From ₦14, 000 to ₦30, 000? It is unjust, callous and a sheer inconsideration to the poor Nigerian students. We shall not sit with our arms folded and watch students pay such fees through their nose. It is time to show them that enough is enough. The fees must fall,” another correspondent of ours, who insists his name should not be published, stormed.
An ongoing Facebook poll has shown that 26.1% of the students are ready to go on hunger strike. 40.6% are ready to go on lecture strike. 23.3% are ready to go on the two. While 10% don’t want wahala for themselves – they are indifferent.
Chidebere Johnson reminded Yesterday’s Today’s reporter of Pa Einstein’s advice about the folly of doing something over and over again and expecting a dissimilar result.
“Unanimously, we don’t even need to protest. Don’t apply the same method for years that has been useless and futile. Do you know hunger strike? Good. We can all do that together with lecture strike, in unison. Nobody goes to lectures. That’s just one of the many confirm and legal actions that can be taken.
“But this is where the spirit of unity is at work. As for me, being my Level Rep, I will influence my friends and classmates to join me in this campaign. And enjoin my fellow UItes to join me in this. We will not be doing it for ourselves alone; we will be doing it for generations to come.”
In our interview with parents on their take on the move, their responses agree with their wards’.
“Where do they want us to get such amount of money from? I’m a state worker whose husband died while my son [in your school] suckle. Oyo state government haven’t paid our salary for longer than I can remember now. No payment of salary not to talk of increment in salary. Yet they expect me to cope; how?” Mrs Okofu, a state government worker, queried, before going on to add, “I’m behind the students. Let them go on hunger strike. They can’t die. Were they even eating before?”
Mr Aderibigbe, a parent who is also a teacher, also lauded the move calling it a smart move. “Truth be told, they don’t need to fight. If they can carry out that plan, it will be a smart move. Should they do it, even Buhari will be forced to respond. Because as I see it many students will be out of school, especially medical students,” he concluded in a pained voice.

Enjoy!
SECONDS AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT:70% of Nigeria will groan. Only if they know what will happen in the coming months. The remaining 30% which is made of up aliens, Stockholm syndrome patients, and herdsmen will jubilate.
HOURS AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT:President Buhari and Nigerians are still in shock. Nigerians are wondering how he got to win. His Excellency is wondering why he didn’t take 100% of the vote. After all he’s done for Nigeria and Nigerians. Ungrateful bunch!
In an unbelievable joy frenzy, Herdsmen will slaughter some of their cows in thanksgiving. They will share the meat across Nigeria, but only the Yorubas will eat.
Riots will start in Igbo and Hausa states.
A DAY LATER:Congratulatory messages will fill the atmosphere. Representatives from Boko Haram will visit the Aso Rock to felicitate with His Excellency. Other presidential candidates will send in their goodwills. Fela Durotoye will go on national TV and talk about the beauty of taking risks, about how you shouldn’t retire from your desire, but instead re-fire till you acquire, despite the quagmire.
He will be arrested minutes later for hate speech.
The riots will keep escalating.
The Presidential speech will be read.
AFTER ONE WEEK:His Excellency will be getting ready to go into a 6-month ‘hibernation’; to figure out the best ways to proceed with the beautiful change process he has started. It’s not easy to be president. Especially when you’re an old one.
People will suddenly discover the highly inspiring presidential speech that was read is a potpourri of Martin Luther, George Washington and Tupac. And they will be happy to have such a well-read President.
The Nigerian army will eventually be deployed to end the riot turned mini-war. They will get there and end things peacefully, encouraging the people not to fight again. As brothers and sisters.
ONE MONTH:the ‘hibernation’ will begin.
There will be a mass emigration of ungrateful Nigerians. Those who can’t afford the expenses to Canada, Holland and England will relocate to Ghana, Cotonou and South Africa.
There will be a ‘power surge’ amongst the herdsmen, and they will begin to commit plenty atrocities. The Igbos and some Hausas will resist and fight. But the Yorubas will not be able to talk because they have eaten fried meat and kilishi.
6 MONTHS:His Excellency will return, but he will get ill. Stress. Too much work has gone into the past months. His cabinet will beg him to go to England and treat the headache. He will say no, that he wants to keep leading by example. No public servant should be treated abroad!
Getting to the National Hospital, the doctors will be confused. They’ve never seen this kind of headache before! They will not have the expertise to treat it.
Finally, His Excellency will reluctantly agree to go to England.
AFTER A YEAR:His Excellency will return again. Messiah. Straight spine. Drums. Gunshots. Cute smiles and encouraging hand waves. Headache gone.
While walking around, will notice that almost all the north and some parts of central Nigeria have been wiped off by Boko Haram and the machine-gun-carrying Herdsmen. He will be livid and warn them not to do that again. He will then order that their guns be seized, since they don’t really need guns to guard the cows.
The good works will then continue. Because his Excellency doesn’t believe in doing the same thing and expecting a different result, he will change his cabinet from the old and recycled leaders to fresh and young minds. He will provide the herdsmen with staffs. And beg the military to forgive them, because they know not what they’re doing.
AFTER TWO YEARS:the purchasing power of the Naira, like it has been since his first day in office, will keep increasing.
His Excellency will complete the hospital and educational projects he has started since the past four years. The National Hospital will now be able to treat headaches.
Boko Haram will finally be crushed. 80% of the herdsmen will be using staffs.
The ungrateful Nigerians will begin to migrate back.
Full of clues and ideas, His Excellency will keep delivering. A Naira will finally be equal to a US dollar. Nigeria will continue to experience fuel surplus, pump price will go from 45 Naira/liter- which he made possible during his last tenure, to 20 Naira/liter. Another airport will be built in Ekiti. The monthly 5000 Naira paid to extremely poor Nigerians will be increased to 10 thousand Naira.
AFTER THREE YEARS:the plan has finally taken an amazing shape. The change. Complete freedom from corruption.
All the recovered monies and loots will be read out, and Nigerians will be satisfied they have so much money to save. Workers will complain bitterly about how the government doesn’t wait for them to finish spending one salary before paying another one. Do they think they are that needy?
Nigeria now has the strongest economy in the northern hemisphere. A drastic increase in life expectancy will be experienced, because every provision for social amenities has finally been perfected. After 7 years.
Nigeria will start begging other countries to come get employment, since we will now have more than enough. Nigerian universities will become educational hubs. Russians and Americans will start going the length to get Nigerian visa and scholarships.
We’re capable, we don’t just have some of the youngest and strongest populace, we also have the natural resources.
AFTER FOUR YEARS:his Excellency will be honoring the invitations of other developed nations to help fight corruption.
Fellow African nations will cry out to Nigeria to teach them how a national reformation can be started in four years, and then completed in another four.
Nigerians will start weeping, they will miss a great revolutionary leader, who has single-handedly lifted Nigeria out of perdition.
Ex president, Pastor Olusegun Obasanjo will write a letter of apology.
His Excellency, President Buhari will be crowned African of the Decade.

Buhari tricks Lagosians into endorsing second term bid with mass trekking,https://punocracy.com/buhari-tricks-lagosians-into-endorsing-second-term-bid-with-mass-trekking/,2018-03-31T07:44:55+01:00,"LAGOS (The T.A. Report) — President Muhammadu Buhari, sources have revealed, successfully tricked residents of Lagos state into endorsing him for a second term with massive trekking.
He achieved this by directing Akinwunmi Ambode, the state governor, to declare a work-free day and close major roads in the state, they said.
One media aide close to the President said Buhari knows the road closure was unnecessary, but thought it could really boost his re-election bid.
“We all know there was no need for roads to be closed down, but the President convinced Ambode that it worked in 2015 and can work again in 2019,” he said.
“Remember a man trekked from Lagos to Abuja for Buhari before he became president and it became a sensation. The idea was what if we have this on a larger scale. You know, thousands of people trekking to work because of Buhari. It might endear the President to people once again.”
Another source close to the President said the President could not bribe people to trek for him for fear it might turn into another scandal.
According to him, “We considered giving money to people from Lagos, considering their opinions are well-respected, to engage in the trekking. But Governor Ambode reminded us of what happened when he gave money to Twitter users to share pictures of a clean Lagos. Besides, the Dr King award we paid for has not really paid off. So, we thought if the carrot will not work, then we might as well use a cane.”
Asked if the strategy has yielded any positive results, he said it is too early to determine.
“We are still waiting to see. It doesn’t seem it’ll work yet, but it was worth a try. And we never can tell too.”

In the quiet and deserted corner of Lagos.
Right at the intersection of Walter Carrington crescent and Ozumba Mbadiwe street.
In Victoria Island.
Standing outside the drivers side of the car.
She screamed at her driver as he stared at her in shock from the open door of the car.
“I said get out of my car!”
“Madam please na.”
“Don’t let me slap you.”
“No be my fault ma.”
A policeman from the detachment of police officers that guard the street which houses the embassies of the US, Germany, Netherlands, India e.t.c ran across to her with his gun still in his hand.
“Madam, wetin e do you?”
She turned to him.
“This man has no respect for consituted authority.”
“Who.be constituted authority?”
“I am. It is my car. I pay his salary. He has no right to disrespect me.”
The policeman turned to the driver.
“Oya come down first.”
The driver stepped out gingerly.
His white shirt and black tie over trousers alongside his well polished black shoes cut a smartly handsome look.
He stood in front of the policeman with his hand behind his back.
“Wetin you do your madam?”
He swallowed unexistent saliva before he fearfully responded.
“Na small mess I mess.”
The policeman lowered his gun.
Dumbfounded.
“You mess?”
The drivers voice had a tremor.

All she could do was mutter in disbelief.

2019: IT IS EITHER BUHARI OR BUHARI.,https://punocracy.com/2019-it-is-either-buhari-or-buhari/,2018-03-27T10:52:05+01:00,"Nigerians can be funny. Rather than rejoice and applaud the gallant stride of the Buhari-led administration for delivering the Dapchi schoolgirls from Boko Haram, they choose to use their suspicious nose to sniff conspiracies. As if that is not enough some even claimed – note, without any evidence than suspicion – that it was staged. For real?
If they are right who staged the deal? Were there middlemen in the deal? Or was it a direct deal? Who were the negotiators? Buhari? Shekau? Mansur Dan-Ali? Buratai? Who? How much was paid? How was it paid? In what currency was it paid? Does Boko Haram spend naira?
Who cares about how much was spent? Would they have preferred a forceful demand? Is our military fit to take up such feat? What did Buhari do right? How come it was this fast? Or is Boko Haram simply just pitying Buhari? Who or where is their next target?
How come their target is always young, vulnerable girls? Why not boys? To expand their number base? To satisfy their sexual urge? Besides, do they have sex too? Do they love too? If they do, how do they show it? Are they loved too? I mean, I’m just curious.
They say book is Haram yet they use bombs. Are bombs made by supplicating using comboloio? If they don’t read how do they know what the government or the people are planning for them? If book was taboo isn’t the first verse revealed to the Prophet ‘Read!’? Do they even understand the lexical exegesis of the Qur’an? Confused fellows.
The PDP joined the bandwagon from the back door, humming and puffing with red-hot fury, dressed in jealousy. They took to Twitter to spill their tears like a toddler from whom a discourteous adult has snatched his lollypop. They claimed the kidnap of Dapchi girls was a political shenanigan from the APC. Same way the abduction of the Chibok girls was a political stunt? Poor party. They always seem clueless.
In a press conference in Abuja, the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan claimed Nigerians know the aim of the“devilish act”.To him and the PDP, it is not only a devilish act, it is also a move“to delude the public, set the stage for an orchestrated rescue, create a heroic myth and false sense of achievement around the APC administration and serve as a spur for President Muhammadu Buhari’s declaration to contest the 2019 presidential election, perhaps in the coming weeks.”
In 2014 when more than 270 Chibok girls were snatched from us, Johnathan (sorry, Dr. Johnathan; how could I forget that?), the then President, was snatched away too — by intelligence slumber. And before he could recover, he was already out of Aso Rock en route Otuoke. When is he going to declare his intention to run again? Poor man.
His wife, Mama Patience, also a doctor — remember her? — had no patience to hold her inglorious tears. Someone said in all the schools she went – even the ones abroad – she was taught in Igbo and pidgin that is why her English is so deficient. She further baptized us with a national ridicule of all-time. By the way, where is she currently? EFCC won’t let her ‘enjoy’ her hard-earned slice of the national cake. Poor woman.  I spotted her at Fatimah Aliko’s wedding in Kano, all smiles and clad in her typical pinky gown, wearing a pancaked face that concealed all her old age wrinkles. We missed her dramatic speeches and heroic humour. It may be the relief dose we need in this hard time.
By the way how come it is APC who has been gallant enough to deliver the snatched girls twice? Is it competence? Is it Buhari’s track record of fighting local insurgency? Or is it that certain persons in the party have a connection with the Boko Haram elements?
The IGP has visited schools in Bornu, Yobe, and Adamawa. He promised the students that the Policemen will be with them 24/7. The innocent children trusted him, roaring with sincere joy. How much trust should they have? Why do we always have to wait for them to strike us before we protect ourselves? He advised them to share any suspicious or strange sight with the Policemen. But have the Policemen been armed with the ammunition and intelligence to rebuff any move to strike by the ‘defeated’ sect? Are we assured that the security arms of the country have learned their lessons and such will never happen again?
Back to Buhari. He has shown, time and again, that he is the man for the big occasion. He delivers when you least expect that any hope is in sight like a certain Arsenal Football Club. He has shown that his administration might have battled too many peace and defensive threats. But, as many as they could be, he can cancel out the deficit by breaking the deadlock with an astonishing offensive onslaught against such threat. He has shown it again by the feat of the Dapchi girls. Who else can boast of such rich CV?
The bragging right couldn’t have returned earlier. You can always say you are the best like Muhammad Alli so long you can back it with result. One of Buhari’s angelic ministers, Mansur Dan-Ali, Minister of Defence, became an actor of braggadocio.
“Basically, I want to speak on the impression that people had that we cannot get the girls released,” he began with full confidence and an obvious face of joy. “If you can remember the last interview I had with Channels Television, I said in two weeks, two months or less we are going to get the girls released and this has happened.”
Dear reader that is walking the talk. Would anyone beat the man’s sense? Even if anyone does, his common sense is simply out of reach for anyone to beat.
At least insecurity is a global issue. We were all alive when the self-acclaimed “God’s own state”, the United State, was thrown into pandemonium by a 19-year-old Nicholas Cruz. Cruz had entered a school and rained gun bullets everywhere, killing 17 pupils. That is the country with the best military in the world, whose toupee President has just increased the spending of his country’s military by $1.3 trillion. How much more Nigeria? Or isn’t that amount way above our national budget? We are trying. Please, Buhari is simply it come 2019. Forget about what anyone says. They talk a lot.
Those saying he is baba go slow. They themselves are “Omo holdup”. Must we complain? Abah! Did they not say slow and steady win the race? In fact, the Yorubas like to caution hastiness when they say,akìí kánjú lábéè gbóná (he who hastily licks a hot soup risks his tongue being burnt).Buhari’s slowness is not weakness but rather a full mastery of the words of the wise.
It took Mahathir Muhammad 22 years (1981-2003) to fix Malaysia. It took Lee Kuan Yew 8 consecutive terms in office for 30 years (1959-1990) to turn Singapore around. It took Jerry Rawlings 26 years (1981-2002) to put Ghana on her two feet. It took Meles Zenawi 12 years (1995-2012) to get Ethiopia afoot. Please, we should not expect Nigeria to be fixed in 3 years. No. Buhari has to return in 2019. Remember there is power in continuity and consistency.
Let me draw your minds to happenings outside the shores of our Atlantic ocean. Though the economy of Russia has been faltering in recent time, the Russian people still believe in the power of continuity and consistency by reelecting the world’s most powerful man, Vladimir Putin. After 18 years in power, he was handed another 6-year term because you just cannot compromise continuity. China took a longer step further. She has just passed to law a lifetime term for her President Xi Jinping. Nigerians we can learn from these people.Biko, it is either Buhari or Buhari come 2019. Is everyone in line?"
ELEHA LEAH AND THE POLITICS OF DECEPTION,https://punocracy.com/eleha-leah-and-the-politics-of-deception/,2018-03-27T06:32:13+01:00,"Omo eni ku, o san ju omo eni nu lo – a dead child is better than a missing child,is an apt proverb when we think about our missing daughter, LEAH Sharibu.
It hurts My President, Muhammadu Buhari, and me, Penkelemesi Alayabioke that a star like Leah would be kept in the dark by terrorists. It is really sad. And what is more saddening is the fact that Baba Buhari’s detractors have said it is part of the seasonal Prison Break movie that Aso Rock Nolly is showing. What impudence!
Youths of this generation, I don’t like them for any reason. Must you attack the President? Don’t you have respect anymore? I see you running your fingers on social media, chattering on and on like wild birds, about how Leah is currently being detained to score a political point. How dare you say Baba is trying to make himself look like the Superhero of Christians and Muslims? Baba has been able to get over 100 girls out of captivity without bragging about it and this is what you pay him with? Is it not enough that you think we staged the release of the other girls?
Boko Haram took our Leah and wants to turn her into an Eleha, something that she obviously is not. My President is a President of all religions and ethnic background, and he is going to save our Leah. When that happens – mark my words it will – Baba will not even make noise about it. It is still the bunch of jobless youths that will turn it into a national debate. What is my own? As long as Baba keeps being our hero; and as long as the hero of Aso Rock, the conqueror of office rats and corruption, the peacekeeper in times of Herdsmen attack, the queller of Boko Haram and saviour of Dapchi girls, is returned to office in 2019, I shall remain a happy old man with no care for the unprepared bunch of youths in our great nation, Nigeria."
A Play of Two Cities: Ramaphosa vs. Buhari,https://punocracy.com/play-of-two-cities-ramaphosa-vs-buhari/,2018-03-26T00:23:32+01:00,"Act One, Scene One
This place goes by many names. But one of the most prominent is, “London of Africa”. Her people were the last to truly gain independence, but they were also one of the first to taste from the pot of prosperity. The streets here are sparkling neat and beautiful, sandwiched between radiant trains of tall trees. The houses also stand tall and proud, with no limbs missing. Here, urban planning is a Bible that is religiously followed. Illegal structures are not demolished every other day. The schools are world-class and the leaders are people-lovers loved by the people.
A crisis has just rocked the government. Zuma, the self-educated polygamist, has just been couriered from the corridor of power. The government accused him of grand corruption; and the honourable thief he is, he had remembered to teach himself also how to resign. A new Sheriff has taken over. His name: Cyril Ramaphosa. Though he is as bald as his predecessor, he is certainly not as bad. His baldness seems to represent transparency, while Zuma’s showed there was literally and literarily “nothing on his head”.
The day is 16 February 2018. Ramaphosa climbs the stage to address the people for the first time as their president. He looked them straight in the eyes, cleared his throat, and declared, among other things:
This is the year in which we will turn the tide of corruption in our public institutions. The criminal justice institutions have been taking initiatives that will enable us to deal effectively with corruption. Amasela aba imali ka Rhilumente mawabanjwe. We must fight corruption, fraud and collusion in the private sector with the same purpose and intensity. We must remember that every time someone receives a bribe there is someone who is prepared to pay it.
“All hail Ramaphosa! All hail Ramaphosa!” cried the people, who saw in him the much-awaited messiah.

Act One, Scene Two
It is a month after the historic and heroic declaration, and Ramaphosa has already rammed into the marketplace of corruption without making a fuss. He is a president-priest who has joined Promise and Action in a blissful matrimony. To the people’s delight, he has made certain Zuma is to face prosecution over 783 counts of longstanding corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering charges. The question at this point is no longer ‘if’ but ‘how soon’, as the country debates who is to pay Zuma’s legal fees.
A bright future waves in the horizon to this Southern country. Being at the feet of Africa, even with great challenges, it has lifted the continent high in the international community. Today, it seems it shall soon grow wings like the Greek God, Hermes, and elevate the black continent even higher.

Act Two, Scene One
The place goes by many names, and one which stands out like a sore thumb is “Giant of Africa”. But even the sons and daughters of this giant laugh at the irony, and mock their leader for offering assistance to one of the continent’s shining light, Ghana. He had said, “See, I am ready to help you fight kwarapshan. Whatever you want me to do, just tell me. I’mghanado it.” And the people of Ghana had responded, “Brada, why not first take care of the kwarapshan in your backyard? If you need advice, we are ready to offer some, man.”
This land, her people were one of the first to gain independence. They were one of the first to taste from the plate of prosperity. But they are also one of first to break this plate just as fast as they got it. What remains from it is called the ‘national cake’. But there is nothing national about it. Only one tribe has access to it: the rich and privileged. Others are forever banned from its scent and taste. They may however have a glimpse using 3D glasses, except most of them cannot even afford it.
Here, urban planning is a myth, regulated day and night by a billion-naira ministry. The city masterplan is a slave to the city’s master planners. Buildings grow like refugee pimples, with no guidance whatsoever. And once in a while, government amputates these outgrowths, rendering people homeless and homes peopleless, and making a city that already looks destitute appear like one of the strongholds of ISIS. Needless to say, the schools are not world-class and the leaders are not people-lovers. One reflects the ills in the other – the schools the leaders, and the leaders the schools.
A crisis has just rocked the government. The shoeless man was given the baton of relay and was asked to run, after the people saw that he now has all sorts of designer sneakers with nothing to show for it. In his place, an agent of change and preacher of the gospel thereof, Muhammadu Buhari – the autocrat turned democrat, the old turned young, the tribalistic turned nationalistic, the Sai Baba of our time and of all times after this – was asked to take on the mantle of manning the mandate of country management.
It was indeed a historic moment. Never in the past had the country witnessed so huge a revolution. And so, the people hi-fived and patted themselves on the back, expecting a change from adversity to prosperity. Their expectations are not too high; they only want corruption and insecurity to be given a quit notice from the land. On 29 May 2015, Sai Baba mounted the lectern to affirm and stamp the people’s modest aspirations. He cleared his throat, looked them straight in the eye [through his tinted goggles] and proclaimed:
My people … At home we face enormous challenges. Insecurity, pervasive corruption, the hitherto unending and seemingly impossible fuel and power shortages are the immediate concerns. We are going to tackle them head on. Nigerians will not regret that they have entrusted national responsibility to us. We must not succumb to hopelessness and defeatism. We can fix our problems.
“Sai Baba! Sai Baba! Sai Buhari!” the people cried out, until their lungs also cried with them – for help.

Act Two, Scene Two
Nearly three years, several trips abroad and countless scandals after, the preacher of change has refused to be a practitioner of it. His ways are of the old. His reasoning is of the ancient. He leaves the people of Nigeria wondering where they got it wrong. Had they mistaken a snail for a ram because of what looked like horns? Had they thought the axe was a distant relative because its butt was wrapped in wood? One of them, with a PhD in Russian Savagery, even tweeted, “Perhaps when he cleared his throat to deliver his inaugural address, he was clearing it of truth and not phlegm.”
Today, 23 March 2018, Buhari shall mount the podium once again. It is the first time he would grant a press conference in his own country, and it is, people thought, the perfect opportunity to demand for answers. His, Minister of Misinformation, Lai Baba, is seen walking to the podium to declare the event open.
Lai Baba:[clears his throat] Gentlemen of the press, I thank you for accepting our invitation to attend this event. It is indeed a great honour to have you here today and make history with us. We all know this is the first time since the days of Mansa Musa and Shaka the Zulu that any African leader will grant a press conference in his country; and it calls for celebration. Records also show that it is the third time ever in the whole world, with North Korea and Brazil taking the first and second position. It shows how much Mr President cares about this country, and how much respect he has for accountability… Thank you once again for joining us. I shall now invite the His Excellency, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, to address us.
[Lai Baba leaves the lectern, and Sai Baba gently fills his shoes.]
Sai Baba:Good morning, gentlemen of the press. You all know I am a military man, and so I am not a fan of long speeches. I will thus not be taking your time.
[Mild laughter dances through the hall.]
Sai Baba: [Continues] I have just put this in place to ask Nigerians to trust us with their votes in 2019. Nigeria has, under my watch, become a force to reckon with in the world. No other African leader has gone to Germany to put Merkel in her place, and declare that the woman’s workplace is in the oza room. Quote me anywhere. No other African leader! Not even Robert Mugabe. Again, under my watch, Boko Haram has been technically defeated, and only kidnaps people haphazardly. You can see from recent evidence that they even moved among the people, waved to them, and did not kill anybody. This shows that our government has finally tamed them. Finally, we have recovered trillions of naira under this administration, and we are keeping them safely for times of great need [whispers to himself, “like 2019”.] … So, we urge Nigerians to give us their mandate that we may continue the good works.
Lai Baba: Err, anyone have questions?
Journalist 1: Yes, Mr President. What is your take on the economy and Nigeria’s soaring unemployment rates?
Sai Baba: Yes, you see, this is because of the shortcomings of the Jonathan government. We are still trying to undo their misdeeds. It will certainly take time, and that is why we need Nigerians’ votes come 2019… Yowa! Next question?
Journalist 2: What do you have to say about the deteriorating health sector sir and Bill Gates’ recent allegations?
Sai Baba: Do not mind Gates. Why did he not talk when the Jonathan government was underfunding and understaffing everywhere? Now that I am in government, he thinks he can rubbish the legacy of change I have been trying to build. I have already set up a committee to look into his speech, and how we can react as a government. Next question, please.
Journalist 3: Nigeria’s ranking has got worse on the Global Transparency Index, Mr President. What is your government doing about it?
Sai Baba: Well, one, we cannot totally trust that platform called Transparency International. The Chairman asked for Zahra’s hand in marriage in 2015, but I said no, that I was going to marry her off to a fellow Nigerian. I suspect that is why they are sponsoring this shameless propaganda. This government has almost eradicated corruption. Our policemen only collect taxes and fines now, not bribes. And whistle blowers continue to expose corrupt practices. Whatever is left of corruption is because of the terrible Jonathan administration.
Journalist 4: But, sir, if the Jonathan government is to blame for all these things, including corruption, why have you not charged Dr Goodluck Jonathan to court yet? Is he above the law?
[Other journalists begin to cough and murmur.]
Lai Baba: [cuts in] Mr man, what is your name? Which organisation do you represent?
Journalist 4: My name is Sunkanmi, and I represent Sahara Reporters, sir.
Lai Baba: Haha! How did you get a pass? But we didn’t invite you…
Journalist 4: Ermm…. But…
Lai Baba: Security! Security! Security!
[Operatives of the SSS batter and handcuff Sunkanmi as they lead him outside the hall.]
Lai Baba: Ladies and gentlemen of the press, we are sorry but, due to a security breach, we have to call it a day. Thank you so much for coming.

[Exeunts Sai Baba, Lai Baba and other aides hurriedly, as some journalists scamper for brown objects that appear to be envelops.]

"BREAKING: Boko-Haram recaptures Dapchi girls, says ransom not enough",https://punocracy.com/breaking-boko-haram-recaptures-dapchi-girls-says-ransom-not-enough/,2018-03-22T08:00:32+01:00,"YOBE (The T.A. Report) — Barely 24 hours after the widely celebrated release of the Dapchi schoolgirls, The T.A. Report gathers that they have been abducted yet again.
A security guard stationed close to the Dapchi Government Science and Technical College said he received calls from many parents just after daybreak reporting that their children were discovered missing at the General Hospital, where they were taken to on Wednesday for checks and treatment.
An eminent member of Boko Haram confirmed to our correspondent that this truly happened. He cited the inadequacy of ransom paid by the Federal Government as reason for the second raid.
“The government is not serious at all,” he said, “When we released 82 Chibok girls last year, they paid us 2 million Euros. But now that we released more than 100 girls from Dapchi, they are saying they cannot afford more than $1 million, that the budget has not been passed and the economy is weak.”
“Please was the economy not weak last year?” he asked rhetorically.
“How many guns and bombs and trucks can we buy with just $1 million? Even the police with out-dated weapons can do nothing with it. How many wives even can our members marry with just $1 million? Please tell the Federal Government that we can make up to $10 million from these girls if we sell them to our foreign friends. We released them only because we love this community; but they may leave us with no other choice.”
The Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has however denied allegations that the Government paid a ransom to the terrorist sect for yesterday’s release.
“We are looking into the information of the girls’ re-abduction. But don’t let anybody fool you that we paid Boko Haram. No. We only gave them little money to fuel the nine trucks they used to return the girls safely. All it really took was for President Buhari to throw his body language and weight behind the negotiations,” he said.
“We have been told that the Chief Medical Director of the General Hospital is a card-carrying member of PDP and close ally of Goodluck Jonathan; and we promise to look into this soon. First we must do all we can to bring back our girls,” he added.

We hereby refuse to accept responsibility for the results of anyone’s credulity or mischief. Do not take us serious.

Nigeria is too old for the young,https://punocracy.com/nigeria-is-too-old-for-the-young/,2018-03-21T07:00:55+01:00,"
As the Yoruba people of Ile-Ife would say,erinoni fan, ki omo e fan –the elephant will not blow its trumpet, and its child would do so at the same time. I,Penkelemesi Alayabiokewholly adopt this agelong proverb.
Ehn, why should I not adopt it? From time immemorial, is it not the elderly, regardless of how old, or how frail, that will decide who does what and how? I hear some of you saying that we are too old for the government,iffahear, ko s’arugbo ni Ghana – there is no old man in Ghana.
You children of nowadays are a bulk of uncultured swine. You make stipends, and suddenly think you are old enough to decide for a nation of about 186 million people.Haba!Even in our national anthem, we say“our fatherland,”we say“our heroes past,”we say“guide our leaders right,”and importantly, we mention that God should“help our youth, the truth to know,”and this is the truth, the youth should not be found in place of power. The youths should pray for their fathers, the youths should celebrate our past heroes, even if it is the same people from 1966 till now, they are still heroes, and the youth should respect the elderso.
We are Africans and we have our way of doing our things… and the African way is that the elder has to lead, ignoring that he is old, or cannot hear the problems of the masses, and is too busy flying to London to fix his hearing problems, or that the elder cannot join you on twitter to end SARS; the elders will always know what is best.
I see some young men who made smallowo kolo – piggy bank money,and are carrying a banner that they want to run for Presidency, the only thing you will be running is your mouth- especially that public speaker among them. Look here children, do you think that managing business, or running consortium for building capacity of over a hundred thousand youths is enough to make you a Presidential candidate? How well do you know the game of corruption,ehn?Tell me, how much do you have in accounts littered across Europe?Oh oh.You want to rule a 57 and half-year-old Nigeria, you a boy of what age? How many times have you been given state pardon for committing a crime?Ehn?
How many times have you been hunted in your capacity as Vice President, for being corrupt? Tell me, how many times you have been summoned to appear before CCT, EFCC, ICPC, and a sea of other anti-corruption agencies and judicial arm? You say you have companies, you say your companies are a representation of the nation, but to encourage your workers by driving them without brakes on the highway of recession, you cannot do. To pay half salaries, you cannot do. To let them go on indefinite strikes, you cannot do. You cannot be a leader if you cannot motivate your people to be hardworking, without getting paidthat muchfor it. The white man will say it is volunteering job.
You see this country Nigeria, it needs a fantastically corrupt person to handle it. And all the white linen you people are parading yourselves in is not what will save our country.Abi,Yorubas will sayole lo mo ese ole to l’ori Apata–it is the thief that knows how to trail the footprint of another thief on the rock. No past criminal record. You have never been military Head of State, you do not have important people in government, your relatives are not holding important offices, but all of you are coming here to say it is your turn to rule. This country is too old for you to rulejare.You are all nothing but leaders of tomorrow. And tomorrow will never come if the elders do not decree it to do so.

The carried-over questions that must be answered,https://punocracy.com/the-carried-over-questions-that-must-answered/,2018-03-20T10:15:40+01:00,"“I don’t think anyone is happier than I’m now that JAC has called off its strike.”
“Point of correction they didn’t call off the strike; they suspended it – for five weeks. They will not hesitate to resume the strike if the government reneges on the agreements reached or delays in any aspects. I read their Press release.”
“Whatever. I’mshahappy about the development.”
“You are happy? What’s thrilling about it? Because I don’t seem to understand you.”
“Home has been boring. I just need a break away from home. And besides, it’s three months since the strike began. Isn’t that good news enough,ehn?”
“Good news my foot! It is not a good news until there is a full and proper implementation of their 2009 Agreements with the federal government as well as the various Memoranda of Terms of Settlements. Then we can be sure we will not be stricken by their strikes for long. Else it is as good as postponing the evil day.”
“Well, be that as it may, resumption is underway. At least you know each time the VC rolls out a piece like the one he recently rolled out, resumption is in sight.”
“Talking about the VC’s release, it baffles me a lot.”
“Well, that’s your headache. Nurse it yourself.”
“Is it out of place to question something the VC says?”
“See I’m not sure I’m ready to start what I can’t finish. A year is all I have left. I don’t want it tripled.”
“Coward. Tell me: what then is the essence of your whole years in the university when you can’t speak truth to power.”
“Speak truth to power? In this University? Wait first; to who? Count me out.”
“I’m baffled about your fear. As much as I’m not in support of insolence or tactless backlashes on our in locoparentis, I hate it when anyone shies away from telling the truth – irrespective of whoever’s ox is gored.”
“Youshawant to put yourself in trouble! Be careful o. Don’t say I didn’t say my own.”
“But the VC himself wrote on his Facebook wall that deliberate efforts have to be made to develop graduates core skills like critical and analytical skills creative problems. How else does one develop these skills if not by asking questions?”
“You can do that in class. Ask your lecturers or your friends. Not the management. Not the VC…”
“Why? Because he is a Prof? Or because he is infallible?”
“Isn’t that a long yardstick?”
“Indeed. By the way, why isn’t he always quick to speak to the students when either party seems aggrieved? Facebook is almost becoming his mouthpiece.”
“Have you forgotten that these days, we are not just always online, we live online?”
“Meaning we enrolled on Facebook,abi? Or is UI University of Internet on Facebook? So much that we must go there to know what is on the VC’s mind.”
“Ah! You are stepping out of bounds! You may have freedom of speech, remember; freedom after a speech is not guaranteed, however.”
“During Adewole’s stint in UI, when students are at loggerheads with the management he comes out to address them. When have you seen Olayinka do same? When?”
“My last statement still stands. Besides he did that – I’m not sure if I will be correct by saying he does that – on Diamond FM during the #FreeMote saga.”
“If that is the case, our mission of baking graduates who are ‘worthy in character and sound judgment’ is a farce. So, I feel UI needs a change of mantra.”
“For you to be worthy in character you must not be disrespectful to the elders. Respect is reciprocal.”
“And disrespect is reciprocal, too.”
“That sounds disrespectful. I’m sure you know.”
“Disrespectful? By asking a question or providing your own version of the solution to the school’s troubles?”
“I won’t answer that!”
“Read this!”
“Universities would not exist without students. Students are at the heart of the academic enterprise. It is worth remembering that some of the earliest universities, in medieval Italy, were established and managed by students.”
“Wait. Pause there. Oya, read on.”
“In the 21st century, in the era of massification, students are often seen as burdens, customers, or sources of income, but seldom as the key rationale for the university.”
“Clapyourself! That’s where some of the problems sleep.”
“Those are Prof. Philip G. Altbach’s words, not mine!”
“Exactly my point. At least it is contained in your textbook, not mine.”
“And so?”
“The essence of these discoveries is to implement them and not make them breathe on book pages while they are dead in reality.”
“Well, for the first time today, I agree with you.”
“Good for you. Beyond that, in that same post, students were called ultimate losers. They were also told not to unduly prolong the academic calendar. I may agree with the former. As for the latter, it can’t hold much air talk more water.”
“What do you mean?”
“For instance, look at the case of ID card delay. Till date, only a few have gotten their ID cards. And in fact, those that have gotten theirs were not given what the school promised.”
“What did the school promise?”
“They promised us an e-card that is multipurpose and standard. Yet, they can’t fulfill it after two years. What do you call that?”
“Again, I agree. 100%.”
“Yet, to the management students are still seen as small boys who are immature to think for themselves talk more think for the larger society. Or was it not with our ears we heard that the Students’ Union President had no beard? Tell me, of what connection is the beard and maturity?”
“But we don’t have anyone to report or complain to.”
“Yes, maybe you are right. But be that as it may, for them not to trust our mental capacity to solve problems then we also should question the relevance of the lessons they teach us in class.”
“Yes. Indeed you have raised a valid point. This act has, by a wide margin, crippled students self-esteem and confidence. Especially me.”
“That is why we must continue to ask the right questions. But remember your thinking cap must not be tilted when you are doing so.”
“It must be straight and upright.”
“Exactly. Take a look at the acceptance fee new intakes had to pay. No explanation. No pity. No consultation. Nothing.”
“I heard of a boy who couldn’t raise the fee before the deadline. He had to forfeit his admission.”
“Again, we suspect the possibility of increment in our school fee as well as accommodation fee. We’ve always been told time and again that we are not paying school fee. School fee is free, and that we lucky to make it into this University.”
“I only hope the increment will not come alive.”
“If eventually, it does, there will be no address as to why the increase has to stand. It is just a change we are expected to adapt to immediately by accepting without questioning. Well, would you blame them?”
“I think they have to understand that they, too, can be wrong. Irrespective of their age, status, experience, position, degree or degree, they are not infallible.”
“Add to that, and that we the students may not have it all but we have never lost it all.”
“Of course. Do they have it all either?”
“Well, their body language claims they do.”
“See, let’s talk about something else.”
“Book of life!”
“Imagine, 512 students have beentsunamizedout of the school.”
“Ah! About one-sixth of the newly admitted students. This is terrible. Blame the students as you like, the aftermath of incessant strike actions is part of what is playing out here.”
“Zoology is the worst hit. Many are out of Pharmacy and Veterinary Medicine too”
“Poor souls. The Minister of Education is the smartest Minister and most brilliant decision maker of all-time. He deserves a fresh bunch of banana for scrapping Post UTME. He must be proud of himself by now.”
“I still feel the leaking of the document called Book of Life is one of the holes in our school’s system. How a confidential document leaks few minutes after the Senate sits on the result is astonishing?”
“Maybe there are snitches in there. For every twelve, you know…”
“There is always a Judas.”
“Another big discourse you’ve just raised. We can’t exhaust it words.”
“You can’t be more correct. If this discussion was to stroll into the ears of these so-called eggheads, one can only imagine what will be its aftermath.”
“I think it is high time we implored an all-inclusive running of the school system – where everyone plays a role in maintaining the system. A system where we see each other not as foes in forwardness but, partners in progress.”
“Hmmm. The question is are we ready for that?”"
A Play of Two Cities: Nigeria’s Education System vs. The U.S.,https://punocracy.com/satire-a-play-of-two-cities/,2018-03-16T10:22:52+01:00,"Scene One, City One
It is the 16th day of March. The year is 2018. On this day, like every other, the Sun is wearing a wide grin. The trees are fresh and radiant like never before, as though someone rubbed them with shea butter before dawn stole its way in. The roads are fat and spotless, like rich spoilt kids whose dining room is permanently located at McDonald’s. The people, however, carry on with their day’s activities without pausing to notice the city’s sparkle, splendour, and surrounding beauty. It appears they have grown used to it.
On Alabama avenue, three young Caucasians, between the ages of 20 and 25, are seen cruising side by side in the fanciest of latest cars – 2060 models. One is Henry, another is Stone, and the last fellow goes by the name Steve. The tender fire of a conversation was soon kindled.
Steve: [Winds down and shouts to the other two] It is a beautiful day, isn’t it, fellas?
Henry and Stone: Oh yes! It is.
Henry: I can’t wait to see what records I’ll be shattering today, with the help of my Harvard V10. I have been collaborating with friends in the United Kingdom and Germany to see what changes we can make to our cities together. By 2020, we hope to send gasoline packing as we commercialise other sources of automobile energy.
Stone: Great work there, man!
Steve: Excellent! You guys sure know our cars cannot have a smooth sail without the city in great shape. So we have to do all we can to constantly improve it. My team and I, with our MIT 99, are already set to launch streetlights powered both by lunar and solar power. We just discovered we can tap from the moon at night just as much as we tap from the Sun when it’s day. With this, we can even have enough backup energy to last through unexpected blackouts.
Henry: Beautiful! Beautiful!
Steve: What about you, Stone? What have you been up to of late?
Stone: Well, I have just been concerned with speed, sincerely. Yesterday, my supercool sports car, Stanford+, sped at 310 km/hour on the Artificial Intelligence street, off the Innovations Crescent. Today, I am expecting to reach at least 314, before the Chinese beat us to it.
Steve: Boy, that’s remarkable!
Stone: Thank you, bruv!
And so the conversation continued with talks of IoT, AI, Blockchain, Climate Change etc. etc. Soon after, all three young men parked their vehicles just outside a skyscraper on Century Street, New World District. Boldly written on the intimidating structure is number 21. One by one, they entered. There was no guard at the gate, only a robotic scanner. After Stone, the last of the three, made his way in, the door silently shut by itself. “Welcome to the future,” it said in a soothing female voice.

Scene Two, City Two
The date is 16th of March. The year is 2018. The country is somewhere under the armpit of Africa, far away from its round head, foot and horn. Today, like every other, the Sun wears a frown. It is a little too hot. The day before, it was a little bit on the other side of hot. It has always been this way, hot or cold enough to make life difficult, but not too much to anger or madden its subjects. In this place, there are no trees. All were cut down decades ago and replaced with electric poles having little or no wires.
On the poles are big, colourful posters of men with caps and flowing attires. Their smile almost compensated for the Sun’s frown – wide enough to cover nearly all their edited faces. The streets are lean and haggard, like refugees from East Africa. Their skin, already made from dust, is covered in even more. Nothing is smooth. It is either high from bumps and bruises, or low from wounds and rashes.
We see three black boys, between ages 20 and 25, pushing heavily-loaded wheelbarrows. They trudge side-by-side, but never forsaking a convincing smile. One is Akande, another is Uche, and the third is Danjuma.
Danjuma: [wringing a face towel that just flew across his flooded face] Kai! This Sun is hot today o. Even me wey grow up for Bornu dey feel am.
Akande: I dey tell you, but e no mean sha. We go still reach where we dey go.
Uche: Me I don dey reason am. If only we had umbrellas in our wheelbarrows, we could get some protection from the harsh weather, or wetin you think?
Akande: Tah! What do we need those for? We no need am! Humbrella or no humbrella, my own wheelbarrow, UI 303, is the greatest in this place. First and the best, yesterday, today and tomorrow. Gba be!
Danjuma: [laughs hysterically, nearly slipping into a pothole] Chai! Wetin this Oduduwa pikin dey yarn for here? Didn’t you get the memo? NUC just released a ranking with my ABU 212 topping the list. Una no dey watch evening news?
Uche: See me see trouble o! Look at these small boys o. E be like say you need make I reset you to factory settings, ehn? Which one of your wheelbarrows can stand my UNN 767? Ehn? No be say dem say. Nah we dey always win competitions for this country. No be by NUC ranking o! And even if we accept that one, we go still top am next year. Nah borrow we dey borrow you for now.
Akande: Eez like both you are mad, habi? Okay, okay. When my wheelbarrow enter number 850 for top vehicles in the whole wide world, where your own dey? Na ask I dey ask o.
Uche: Abeg, comot for road! Wetin be the difference wey dey number 850 and we wey no enter? Tell me. Make you kuku no enter sef pay you than to disgrace yourself for international stage.
Danjuma: No mind am! The guy don high.
[Danjuma’s wheelbarrow suddenly gets stuck in a muddy pit].
Danjuma: Abeg, guys, come help me push this thing small. Akande, go front to pull am.
Akande: Ha-ha! See exactly wetin I don dey talk since? If nah my own premier wheelbarrow now, e go don tactically manoeuvre that problem. E fit suspend the pothole sef. Greatest UI!
Uche: [While pushing Danjuma’s vehicle] It’s a lie, oga. Great UNN! UNN kwenu!
Danjuma: Hehe, una both wan use me take shine abi? Nah greatest of the greatest ABU o! Nah we dey rock the town, from the South of Sahara to the West of Skilashi and from the East of Skelemba to the North of Limpopo. Forget se pothole dey disgrace us. E fit happen to anybody.
Thus continued the discussion, with occasional cries of ‘great’, ‘greatest’, ‘best’, ‘better’… After exactly nine hours and two minutes, they arrived at number 19, Century Street, off Comfort Crescent. It is a small hut, with its door rebelling against the hinges, and bricks bereaving the loss of their relatives. Written faintly but legibly on its wooden door are the words, “Welcome to the Museum.” As Danjuma parked his wheelbarrow against the wall and hurried inside to join his friends, the door, finally gaining its freedom, slammed against the grimy floor."
Why Nigerian Senators deserve to be paid more than they presently get,https://punocracy.com/why-nigerian-senators-deserve-to-be-paid-more-than-they-presently-get/,2018-03-13T08:30:53+01:00,"Nigerians are at it again. Always finding faults, where none exist, in everything about this paradise called Nigeria. Well, I find it difficult to blame them since the worth of a thing is often unknown until you lose it. This time around, they have started complaining about the so-called staggering pay our hardworking Senators are earning. I have gone over and over the figures hoping to figure out what is staggering about them, and I have not found one thing. Please, tell me what is staggering about a basic salary of ₦750,000? Okay, sorry, plus a sitting allowance/running cost of ₦13.5 million. And, yeah, not to forget the annual ₦200 million added to that for constituency allowance (code name for personal convenience allowance), among other petty additions. Tell me, what is staggering about this – except of course that it is in fact staggeringly small!
Our senators deserve more than this paltry sum. I mean; need I remind us that ours is one of the richest countries of the world, with one of the lowest poverty and unemployment rates, as well as a towering human development index ranking? With all this in mind, why should any sane person have a problem with our Senators earning ₦370 million per annum? Per annum, ladies, gentlemen and critics! Not even per week or per month.Haba!
Let us not forget that Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world where law-making is a full-time job. These people, with their impeccable love for Nigeria, have abandoned everything – their jobs, their families, their businesses – just to serve this country 24/7. They hardly even have time for themselves, which explains why many of them often sleep during plenary sessions. They spend hours upon hours deliberating how Nigeria can be much better than she already is.  Why else do we think they are called “honourable”? It is because of the daunting, selfless and, needless to say, honourable, nature of the job. The least we can do is pay them a little above the national minimum wage – say, about three or four more zeros. We are only encouraging them to work more with this small incentive.
[KiwiClickToTweet tweet=”They hardly even have time for themselves, which explains why many of them often sleep during plenaries.” quote=”They hardly even have time for themselves, which explains why many of them often sleep during plenary sessions.”]
Not only are our Senators hardworking and selfless, they are also loaded with lots of experience – which of course cannot be bought in the market, even black ones. Many of them are ex-members of Houses of Assembly and the House of Representative. Some of them have even served one or two terms as Governors. Not only that, they are equally blessed with great academic and professional achievements. Take a look at the Great Senator Dino Melaye for instance who graduated with a remarkable third class from Ahmadu Bello University when his mates were dropping out, and who (almost got away with the claim that he) graduated from both Harvard University and the London School of Economics.
Another fine Senator is David Alechenu Bonaventure Mark, GCON, whose chain of experience is almost as long as his name. Not only is he a retired Nigerian Army Brigadier General and former Military Governor of Niger state, he was also Senate President for a whopping eight years. Yet, he has come back yet again to serve in the house. And let us not cast aside our very own Ben Murray-Bruce, the founder of Silverbird Group. Even if you question this man’s experience, you certainly cannot match his common sense.
Finally, the lifestyle of a Senator is not easy to sustain. I am in fact sure many of them are constantly broke because of unending expenses. They have to send their children to the best schools in the world, they have to own luxury mansions both home and abroad to showcase the wealth Jehovah has blessed Nigeria with, they have to employ about a hundred staff (you know, cooks, car drivers, gatekeepers, phone holders, social media assistants, twitter handlers, and that kinda thing), they have to wear only designer attires imported from the abroad (including agbadas and babarigas) – as all stated under Section 419, subsections 1 – 6 of the 1999 constitution (passed, by the way, by none other than “we the people of Nigeria”).
Our Senators are also always victimised up and down with requests from everybody at every event. One 2013 study in fact shows that the average Senator gets up to 10,000 emails daily requesting for one support or the other. They therefore end up spending 90% of the salary given to them by the people back on the same people. It is pathetic. Our senators have become the primary source of Externally Generated Revenue for student organisations, NGOs among other bodies. And, of course, the saints they are, they always find it difficult to say “no” to these requests.
So, fellow Nigerians, the only debate that is worthy of our time is simply how much more we should add to the insufficient allowances of our Senators, not whether it is too much or not. The fate of any country lies in the quality of the laws that guide it. And the quality of the laws depends on the lifestyle of the Senators. Let us therefore treat our Senators as kings, even though we starve and die awful deaths in the process. I assure you it is worth it. There is no accomplishment greater than having a minute silence in your honour on the floor of the Red Chambers. And if, perchance, our dear Senators are too busy to do this while legislating for the remaining souls alive, don’t worry for you are a martyr nonetheless. A most patriotic one."
Governor Yahaya Bello Says Importation of Military Equipment Meant for the New State-Sponsored Movie,https://punocracy.com/governor-yahaya-bello-says-importation-of-military-equipment-meant-for-the-new-state-sponsored-movie/,2018-03-12T14:44:03+01:00,"[Lokoja]—The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, after days of uncomfortable silence has finally revealed that the military equipment intercepted by men of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) was actually meant for the making of a new state-sponsored movie titled “Inikpi Returns”.
Recall that the Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye has accused the governor on the floor of the Red Chambers to have imported sewn military camouflages with boller hats, many bullet proof vests, night vision googles, tactical boots, tactical knapsacks, training canvas, boxing gloves and so on.
The Senator also revealed that the military equipment has been intercepted by the Nigerian Customs Service and urged the Senate to investigate the governor while referring to him as a threat to democracy.However, the Governor has since denied the allegation in a press statement signed by the Senior Special Assistant to Kogi State Governor on Entertainments, Arts and Culture, Mercy Johnson-Okojie and made available to the press this morning.According to the press release, “The military equipment was meant for the making of our new state-sponsored movie, Inikpi Returns, which is a sequel to the Frank Rajah Arase directed Inikpi released late last year featuring Sam Dede, Odunlade Adekola, Saheed Balogun, Paul Obazele, Abija, Agbako among others.”She noted that though the first Inikpi was a box office disaster due to some technical faults on the part of the costumier and the imagineer, Inikpi Returns is set to set new records in the Nigerian film making industry as the state is doing everything to make sure that it re-creates reality as much as possible which explains the importation of real military equipment from North Korea.She further revealed that “the state is very impressed at the success and popularity of the Black Panther Movie and the whole concept of Wakanda Kingdom and which is why we are trying to draw enough inspiration from Ryan Kyle Coogler who has agreed to send his boys to help us on the set for the new movie, isn’t that impressive?“We need to reiterate that what we are trying to do here has never been done in the history of film making in Nigeria, Inikpi Returns is set to explore the story of a secret lineage of warriors traceable to the events following the ultimate sacrifice of the legendary Igala Princess, Inikpi, to save her people.“The movie explores these warriors as vigilante, superheroes and protectors of the Igala Kingdom right from the ancient days to the modern day and stuffs like that though I need to be truthful with you that we are yet to fully put the stories together, it is still a work in progress and all sons and daughters are welcomed to contribute their ideas on our Wiki page,” she enjoined.In a phone call by our columnist to the Senior Special Assistant to confirm the authenticity of the release, she added, “As a matter of fact, Dino Melaye is a dishonourable Senator and what he has succeeded in his pettiness was to raise a mere false alarm to disgrace his state on the floor of the Senate. When he leaves that Abuja we will be waiting for him here at home. Anyway, we have been speaking with the Custom Boss and the whole situation was just a misunderstanding, in fact, Hammed Ibrahim Ali has not only promised to release the equipment but he has also promised to make a guest appearance in the upcoming movie.“To us, this is not just about film making, it is not just about empowering our people and preserving our stories, it is much more about our IGR, we need to generate revenue at all cost to pay for workers’ salaries and see to the welfare of the citizens in the state. And you see, that movie when it finally becomes a box office success, it will hold the magic key to get the governor elected for a second term,” she revealed in a low whisper.Actors and Actresses on set location for the movie.Not certain about the account of the Senior Special Assistant, our columnist further placed a call to the most powerful man in the cabinet, the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Edward Onoja, who surprisingly confirmed the release. When asked about the whole drama of sacking and reinstating all cabinet members by the Governor, he said: “You’ve said it yourself, it is all drama. It is meant to be part of the trailer we are releasing to the public for the Inikpi Returns Movie. Or would you have believed that? Of course, you wouldn’t! What kind of Governor sacks the entire cabinet at this strategic political moment? It is all part of this administration strategy to show love for Association of Nigerian Theatre Arts Practitioners (ANTP) and Theatre Arts Practitioners all over the world. We are very surprised to discover people are actually having headache over the issue. I wonder if they had forgotten the words of Terry Mark that“Never let somebody’s drama determine the outcome of your day.”“51voteArticle Rating

“We need to reiterate that what we are trying to do here has never been done in the history of film making in Nigeria, Inikpi Returns is set to explore the story of a secret lineage of warriors traceable to the events following the ultimate sacrifice of the legendary Igala Princess, Inikpi, to save her people.“The movie explores these warriors as vigilante, superheroes and protectors of the Igala Kingdom right from the ancient days to the modern day and stuffs like that though I need to be truthful with you that we are yet to fully put the stories together, it is still a work in progress and all sons and daughters are welcomed to contribute their ideas on our Wiki page,” she enjoined.In a phone call by our columnist to the Senior Special Assistant to confirm the authenticity of the release, she added, “As a matter of fact, Dino Melaye is a dishonourable Senator and what he has succeeded in his pettiness was to raise a mere false alarm to disgrace his state on the floor of the Senate. When he leaves that Abuja we will be waiting for him here at home. Anyway, we have been speaking with the Custom Boss and the whole situation was just a misunderstanding, in fact, Hammed Ibrahim Ali has not only promised to release the equipment but he has also promised to make a guest appearance in the upcoming movie.“To us, this is not just about film making, it is not just about empowering our people and preserving our stories, it is much more about our IGR, we need to generate revenue at all cost to pay for workers’ salaries and see to the welfare of the citizens in the state. And you see, that movie when it finally becomes a box office success, it will hold the magic key to get the governor elected for a second term,” she revealed in a low whisper.Actors and Actresses on set location for the movie.Not certain about the account of the Senior Special Assistant, our columnist further placed a call to the most powerful man in the cabinet, the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Edward Onoja, who surprisingly confirmed the release. When asked about the whole drama of sacking and reinstating all cabinet members by the Governor, he said: “You’ve said it yourself, it is all drama. It is meant to be part of the trailer we are releasing to the public for the Inikpi Returns Movie. Or would you have believed that? Of course, you wouldn’t! What kind of Governor sacks the entire cabinet at this strategic political moment? It is all part of this administration strategy to show love for Association of Nigerian Theatre Arts Practitioners (ANTP) and Theatre Arts Practitioners all over the world.

"Governor Rauf Aregbesola pays 2019 salaries in advance, vows his government has come to stay",https://punocracy.com/governor-rauf-aregbesola-pays-2019-salaries-in-advance-vows-his-government-has-come-to-stay/,2018-03-12T08:33:17+01:00,"Governor State of Osun, Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, declared at the weekend while addressing a delegate from the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) Osun State Chapter that the payment of all owed salaries by the State Government had commenced. “We have commenced the payment of all owed arrears. The catch: all 2019 salaries and bonuses — from January to December — are being paid too in advance.”
In a 30-minute speech delivered by the political maverick, he profusely apologised, “We are sorry for any inconveniences we might have caused our workers. We are deeply sorry. It was a situation beyond our control. As you all know, China has been having a lot of dreadful environmental issues and there was a disastrous hurricane in the United States. All these, among others, put us in a very tight situation that we couldn’t just find our way around.”
He went on to emphatically state, “My people love me. They want me to remain in power, even beyond 2018. In fact, they are not unwilling to go against all democratic processes to reinstate me in the forthcoming elections. Although I cannot contest again, they will find a way themselves to make that happen.”
The Governor, toward the end of his speech, went ahead to promise, “Plans are already in the pipeline to start sending our teachers to Cuba. We have noticed that our inefficient payment of salaries for the past two years has negatively impacted on their psyche.” “We understand they may have to go to Cuba to learn some novel dance steps like Salsa and to breathe in its fresh air to be able to regain their sanity,” he concluded.
Mrs. Folaremi Ajanlekoko, a teacher at Agbalowomeeri Community Grammar School, who our reporter interviewed at the end of the programme, was however full of skepticism for the promises of the Governor. “Our governor talks more than he does. This is not the first time he would be making such groundbreaking promises only to renege on them. Nevertheless, we love him and we want him to remain in power for as long as he wishes,” she said, with a smile flashing across her face."
"President Buhari really thinks he is fighting corruption, medical report shows",https://punocracy.com/president-buhari-really-thinks-he-is-fighting-corruption-medical-report-shows/,2018-03-12T06:06:16+01:00,"ABUJA (The T.A. Report) — Chief Medical Director of Aso Rock Clinic, Dr Hussain Munir, says he is shocked to discover President Muhammadu Buhari actually believes he is fighting corruption.
Following the President’s infamous remark last Tuesday at Ghana’s independence anniversary celebration when hepromised the country support in fighting corruption, Dr Munir said he thought he was joking at first, but “new tests have shown that President Muhammadu Buhari could actually believe Nigeria is fighting corruption and is in a position to help others.”
He made this revelation at the maiden edition of the Annual Medical Practitioners’ Convention held on Monday at Sheraton Hotel, Abuja.
The medical report, a copy of which was obtained by a T.A. Report correspondent, claims the President suffers from a strange form of schizophrenia calledschizophrenia asovilae. “It is characterised by thoughts or experiences that seem out of touch with reality, disorganised speech or behaviour and decreased participation in daily activities,” the report said.
According to the Aso Rock CMD, this development is disturbing because people mostly do not get this disease after the age of 45. “Nevertheless, the results of this test have assisted us in putting some of the President’s actions into appropriate context, such as his recent remark in Ghana and his refusal to show empathy to victims of clashes in Plateau and Benue states,” he said.
“Remember that, following the unfortunate Munich shooting incident in Germany in July 2016, Mr President alsooffered help to the countryin fighting terrorism.”
“We may need to allocate more money to the Aso Rock Clinic to effectively arrest the situation before it gets out of hand,” he added.
Nigeria’s First Lady, Aisha Buhari, in a swift reaction, has discredited the report as false and misleading. “What is this Dr Munir saying? My husband is perfectly fine. The only doctors who can diagnose him are his personal physicians in the U.K., and they have said no such thing,” she tweeted moments ago.

"“I will run for President in 2019” – declares Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, in new video",https://punocracy.com/i-will-run-for-president-in-2019-declares-boko-haram-leader-abubakar-shekau-in-new-video/,2018-03-11T10:45:26+01:00,"The notorious Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, who now heads one of the two rumoured factions, has officially announced his intention to run for the highest office in Nigeria. The shocking revelation was contained in a five-minute video, recorded in Arabic, which was made available to the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday.
In the video, Mr Shekau was not dressed in his typical military uniform and turban. Rather, he was clad in a flowing white babariga and matching native cap, perhaps signifying that he is a changed man. Also, instead of his signature AK47, he was seen holding a walking stick with green and white colours.
“By Allah, I will be running for the President of Nigeria next year,” he declared two minutes into the video, after his prelude. “I have discovered that we cannot shy away from politics if we want to make real difference, so I have adopted the ideals of what I call Islamist Democracy,” he added.
“I want Nigerians to know that I am not a stranger to politics. I have had many key politicians as friends, and we policies together, but this is not enough.”
Abubakar argued that he is qualified for the top office considering the nature of some other individuals who have indicated interest. “If someone like Fayose, the rigging murderer from Ekiti, or Atiku can become president, why can’t I?” he asked, both hands thrown in front of him. “Besides, I am much younger than most of these people.”
He also promised Nigerians, towards the end of the clip, that he will tackle the problem of insecurity if he is elected as President. “With my experience as a soldier and freedom fighter, I promise to put an end to problems of insecurity once and for all – including Boko-Haram,” he said.
An ongoing opinion poll conducted by BBC Hausa indicates that 27.5% of respondents have no problem with his candidacy.
“The devil we know is better than the messiah we only met on Facebook,” Tunde Ajala, a carpenter from Ibadan, told The T.A. Report. “At least we know what to expect, and not when someone is shouting change, change, only to kill innocent people accidentally and embarrass us every time abroad.”
Mrs Chioma Onakufe, a secondary school teacher from Rivers State, thinks any candidate at all is better than the status quo. “See, anyone or anything but Buhari is good enough for me. Even if the devil becomes a politician today, I will vote for him. At least, with him, we know where we are going,” she said with a straight face.

Let’s face it: President Buhari deserves a second term!,https://punocracy.com/lets-face-it-president-buhari-deserves-a-second-term/,2018-03-10T04:10:52+01:00,"I hear some people saying President Muhammadu Buhari does not deserve a second term, or that he may as well just resign before his first elapses. What nonsense! Are those people living in Nigeria at all? I suspect they are all these people in “the abroad” who think they know it all and can dictate to the original, follow-come (and stay-at-home) Nigerians. The gospel (according to The Punocrat) truth is, His Excellency, President Buhari has performed excellently well in office, and is one the greatest leaders Nigeria has ever had. Tremendous evidence has shown it. Opinion polls, conducted by the BBC (Buhari Broadcasting Corporation) and BMC (Buhari Media Centre), have established it. And I, known for speaking the hard truth since I was a day-old baby, am about to validate it.
To begin with, Baba has shown great wisdom in the appointment of cabinet ministers. The children of anger, in their characteristic bad belle, said he waited half a year before appointing ministers, yet they are no angels, blah! Blah! Shior! How could they not have seen that Baba was only trying to delay the misery and inevitable display of incompetence? We all know death cannot be avoided, but at least it can be delayed. In his foresight, Baba knew the kind of people who awaited him as co-players in the executive arm of government, and he delayed their coming as much as he could to conserve tax payers’ money and reduce the agony to the barest minimum for Nigerians.
I mean; how could we have survived six more months of Abubakar Malami, the pro-corruption Minister of Justice and author of confusion; the non-performing Adamu Adamu of the Ministry of Education who is always in the news for the wrong reasons; and Solomon Dalung, described by sagacious Mike Asukuo as the man with the beret bereft of ideas. Not to forget our beloved Mama Taraba who has mistaken the field of play for the players’ bench in the spectators’ gallery and is just waiting to become governor come 2019; or our ever-gallant Propaganda Minister who has not been known to dish out proper facts, Alhaji Lai Mohammed. Six extra months with these fellas would have been simply suicidal. And Baba saved us from this. Sai Baba!
President Buhari is also a great economist who understands the concept of division of labour. He understands that Nigeria is too big to constantly travel to all the geo-political zones, so he just sticks to where his face is familiar for optimal results. This is a genius move because, by so doing, he has been able to maximise the office of the Vice President and delegated some of the tiring legwork to our good, loyal Prof. And why should he bother visiting the South-South when there is a Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, with annual budgetary pies and everything? The ignorant ones will interpret this as tribalism, favouritism, bigotry or any of these other words they just learnt from Merriam Webster Pocket Dictionary; but they are very wrong. It is merely the age-old application of the age-old rule of division of labour.
Oh, and they say Baba is selective in his anti-corruption war. They point at the cases of his protection of Abdulrashid Maina, Babachir Lawal and Usman Yusuf, the reinstated NHIS chief. My goodness! I have never come across a more embarrassingly silly argument. You call a thing an anti-corruption war, and you expect a soldier to turn against those fighting with him? – or at least by his side? Who does that? Baba is an astute military man and he evidently understands military tactics. Rule number one: at all times, know who your enemy is (in this case, the opposition). Even if your allies are no different in character as the enemy, you must never treat them as the enemy. It’s a basic rule of survival. There really is a lot Nigerians have to learn if they keep throwing about these claims.
And, yes, security too. Boko Haram is still on rampage, they rant.  Herdsmen from a certain tribe have joined, they cry. 110 Dapchi girls have been abducted, they say. Buhari does not know what he is doing and does not deserve a second term, they conclude. But I wonder, really, what are second terms truly for? Is it not to finish off a job that is yet to be perfected? And if that job is done in the first term, what again is there to do please? Slow and steady wins the race people! Justice rushed is justice crushed – and so is development. If Nigeria becomes a paradise today, it is the same people that will find it difficult to adapt and say it is all too sudden. Ahem!At least, the figure has dropped to 110 from the 276 in the Chibok case of 2014. And it will continue to get better – gradually.
Don’t even get me started by suggesting that Baba should do quick-quick and implement his entire manifesto in just four years. If he does that, he will be running contrary to the law of the land that states unequivocally thatevery President has not only the right but is duty bound to seek a second term.I am in fact sure it is written somewhere in the 1999 Constitution. So fellow Nigerians, the change has come, the change is good, and everything good deserves a second chance. Sai baba, sai Buhari till 2023!

To be continued – if you all still do not believe me."
"Tubosun Ajanaku graduates from University of Ibadan, says column to go national",https://punocracy.com/tubosun-ajanaku-graduates-from-university-of-ibadan-says-column-to-go-national/,2018-03-07T02:40:11+01:00,"06 February 2018
Founder of The TA Report, an independent Satirical Column at the University of Ibadan, Tubosun Ajanaku, has confirmed the completion of his programme at the University of Ibadan. He wrote his final paper, GES 401, on Monday afternoon and was seen immediately after among his colleagues at the Department of Theatre Arts engaging in the traditional sign out ritual.
In a Facebook post, Ajanaku wrote about the challenges he faced at the University of Ibadan, his nomination as the entertainer of the year and what the fate of his column is now that he is graduating.
“It has not been easy at all. To spend four years at the University of Ibadan, as they say, is not beans. It has been four years of mosquitoes and malaria, four years of light and darkness, four years of study and strike, four years of (student-)unionfulness and unionlessness. Some have even suggested that I am an unserious student and should be expelled or given an SDC letter, but today they have been put to shame,” he wrote.
“I want to thank the organisers of Emigro for nominating me as the Finalist-Entertainer of the Year. I do not know what they mean by this though. I was expecting to get nominated as Most Handsome or Take Home to Papa of the year, but I am grateful all the same. I urge all my fans to vote for me that I may clinch this award.
In the same post, he said he plans to open a new blog for his column, which will be taking on a national scope soon. He also used the opportunity to thank various individuals at the University.
“Now that I am finally graduating, I will no longer be reporting news from the University of Ibadan. I want to upgrade to the national scene. President Donald Trump has described us a shithole country, and with my big glasses, I want to observe how deep exactly this hole is. I hope to open a blog for this soon, so watch out. Well, I guess this is a potential move from SDC to SSS, but if nobody takes on the big guys, who will?
“I would like to thank my girlfriend, Monisola, for her backing and support. When everyone called me a madman, comedian and liar, she stood by me. I thank all my fathers and mothers at the University of Ibadan, and our dear Vice Chancellor for constantly feeding my muses with groundnuts of ideas. I am grateful sir, and I sincerely wish you all the best in the years that remain for you at the Tamuno Building. I thank especially all my imaginary staff at The TA Report – the graphic designer, the editor, the correspondents and the generator man.
“My appreciation also goes to all students of the University of Ibadan, especially those who read and share our news reports. The Column is nothing without you. May your journeys be laced with challenges and crowned with success. Thank you, University of Ibadan!”

"UI VC Olayinka blames Ojo Aderemi for power outage in Mellanby, Tedder, says nothing can upset examinations",https://punocracy.com/ui-vc-olayinka-blames-ojo-aderemi-for-power-outage-in-mellanby-tedder-says-nothing-can-upset-examinations/,2018-03-07T02:37:01+01:00,"10 January 2018
Ojo Aderemi, President of the suspended Students’ Union of the University of Ibadan, is to blame for the power outage in Mellanby and Tedder Hall, says a statement from the Vice Chancellor, Professor Idowu Olayinka. In the brief statement, which was made public very early on Wednesday, the Vice Chancellor asserted that he has reliable information pointing to Mr Ojo and his cohorts at the National Association of Nigerian Students as those behind the power cut in the two halls.
He wrote: “The attention of the University has been drawn to the recent power cut, which is affecting Kenneth Mellanby and Lord Tedder Halls. It is rather unfortunate that that 200-level student of History, who has been growing impudence where beards are meant to be, will go to this extent in trying to shame the University. I have it on good authority that he, Ojo Aderemi, colluded with his rascal-friends at the so-called National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) to orchestrate this mischief.
“It is our belief that they are using this as a form of propaganda to desperately bolster their point that life on campus is unbearable and to instigate peace-loving students of the University to protest the lack of power and water, and possibly even the suspension of the Union.
“However, we remain resolute on the objective that nothing is going to disrupt the school calendar any longer.Even if Jesus returns today, we will plead with him for time to finish with our examinations. That is how much we love our students.We cannot spend 15 months on a session that is supposed to take only 9 or 10. We hereby plead for calm and assure members of the two halls that we are on top of the situation. We are equally working on making power stable across the University. Thank you.”
When The T.A. Report contacted Ojo Aderemi for his view, he said he has not seen the statement, and added that if it is true, he will have no choice but to respond adequately through an intellectual rejoinder.
“In all my years on this campus, I have never seen a Vice Chancellor as dramatic and paranoid as this. One would think I am having an affair with his wife to deserve this level of distrust. Rather than attack the many issues on campus, he is occupied with throwing libellous allegations about personalities, especially mine. Please tell him that I have no hand in the unfortunate power outage,” he said.
Meanwhile, Philip Olatinwo, a student of the University who was expelled the previous year, has asked for the Vice Chancellor to resign in a comment on his post on Facebook. “Is Mr Vice Chancellor suggesting that he is incapable of ensuring the safety of lives and property on campus? Including items as crucial as power cables? If so, then I suggest that he resigns and hands over the office to a more proactive leader. We cannot have this!” he wrote.

Babatunde Badmus gets query letter as UI management considers introducing GDC – Graduate Disciplinary Council,https://punocracy.com/babatunde-badmus-gets-query-letter-as-ui-management-considers-introducing-gdc-graduate-disciplinary-council/,2018-03-07T02:33:01+01:00,"07 January 2018
The TA Report has been reliably informed that Asiwaju Babatunde Badmus, former President of the Students’ Union, University of Ibadan, has been slammed a query letter for his “rude, disrespectful and insubordinate remark” on the Vice Chancellor’s Facebook post urging students to go on with their examinations. This is coming less than 24 hours after the said remark was posted.
The letter reads in part, “The Student Affairs Division has received a report preferred against you to the effect that you conceived and expressed rude, disrespectful and insubordinate remarks against General Abel Idowu Olayinka. Please provide reasons why your certificate should not be withdrawn and disciplinary actions not taken against you.”
It was also gathered that a high-powered meeting of the Vice Chancellor, Dean of Students, Deputy Registrars and School Legal Adviser is ongoing. And top on the agenda is a proposal that the school should introduce a Graduate Disciplinary Council (GDC) to complement the efforts of the infamous Students’ Disciplinary Council (SDC).
A very reliable source, who prefers to remain anonymous because of “the tension on campus,” told The TA Report that the ongoing meeting is not unconnected to the comment of Babatunde Badmus.
“The Vice Chancellor thinks it is becoming more and more rampant that once students graduate from the university, they resort to Facebook and other social media to lampoon and lambaste their lecturers. Before Babatunde Badmus, we have seen similar cases from individuals like Azeez Shuaib, Oredola Ibrahim and the one that calls himself TCool.”
“The Vice Chancellor is very mad at the way things are turning out. He says we need to find a way to discipline those who pretend while on campus till they are certified worthy in learning and character. They are wolves in sheep clothing, he said. And that is what brought about the idea of a GDC,” he said.
Asiwaju Babatunde Badmus had commented on the Vice Chancellor’s post, “Imagine the posture from a vice chancellor of my own prestigious University of Ibadan. THE TONE OF THIS WRITE UP shows that the vice chancellor will be a better ABACHA. Can you suspend ASUU, NASU and other staff Unions?” And the Vice Chancellor had replied to everyone’s surprise, “Your father and forebears are descendants of Abacha.”
BB, as he is fondly called, appears to be living up to his slogan while he was President of the Students’ Union – Uniting Uites. This is because his comment, which has gone viral, has become a rallying point for students of the university, amassing well over 100 comments and counting.
It remains unclear how the letter of query was written despite the ongoing NASU strike. One theory has it that the Vice Chancellor has tons of such letters on his desk, already signed and with different charges.

“I am not your dean of students” – says Professor Ajuwape,https://punocracy.com/i-am-not-your-dean-of-students-says-professor-ajuwape/,2018-03-07T02:28:30+01:00,"06 January 2018
Professor A.T.P. Ajuwape has denied being the University of Ibadan’s Dean of Students’ Affairs in a call placed to him in the early hours of on Friday, 5 January 2018. A correspondent of The TA Report, during the phone conversation, had attempted to obtain his official statement regarding the current state of student welfare and the just-emerging association, which calls itself The Guerilla Students’ Movement. It came as a shock however when he said, contrary to what many hold as true, that he, Professor Ajuwape, is not the Dean of Students.
“I do not know why people keep referring to me as the Dean of Students. I have corrected them over and over and have become frustrated. Listen to me carefully; I am not your Dean of Students! Go and look for him elsewhere,” he cried over the phone.
“Go and check the records. I can show you my letter of appointment. What is written there is not ‘Dean of Students’ but ‘Jinx of Students’ [that is, Chief-Prosecutor of the SDC],” he added when asked what office he has been occupying since the administration began in 2015.
“It is a new office you see, though a bit older than the office of the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Research, Innovation and Strategic Partnerships. The primary role of the Jinx of Students is to ensure a climate of fear using the instrumentality of SDC letters, proper propaganda and one-on-one coercions. And I have been doing this efficiently, so I do not understand why people are bent on assigning me a new role by force,” he lamented.
A message was sent on Facebook to the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof Idowu Olayinka, requesting for his take on this development. He responded that Professor Ajuwape was in fact appointed as the Dean of Students’ Affairs but he is guessing he did not read the letter to the end.
“The thing is Professor Ajuwape is a very energetic man – that is why you will observe that his initials are A.T.P., standing for adenosine triphosphate. So back in 2015, we looked around for someone to occupy two offices: Dean of Students and Chief-Prosecutor of the SDC (otherwise called Jinx of Students); and we found no better fit than Prof.,” he said. “But, you see, his extraordinary energy sometimes makes him impatient. My guess is that he did not read the letter of appointment to the point where it mentioned ‘Dean of Students’.”
Recall that in 2016, former S.U. President, Ojo Nifemi, had lamented that the student community lacked a Dean of Students. He had said in the press release, “The Union is already where we do not have anybody for us except ourselves… It is just like I am the Dean of Students and he [Speaker of the S.R.C.] is the Union President.”

Acitivities resume at Kunle Adepeju Building as new set of executives takes over,https://punocracy.com/acitivities-resume-at-kunle-adepeju-building-as-new-set-of-executives-takes-over/,2018-03-07T02:24:04+01:00,"11 December 2017
Activities have once again resumed at the Kunle Adepeju Building, popularly known as SUB (Students’ Union Building), as a new set of executives can be seen moving about and working assiduously inside the various offices. This came as a surprise to many students of the University who have lost hope in the restoration of the Students’ Union anytime soon. The T.A. Report, however, gathered that the new officials are members of the newly inaugurated Transition/Caretaker Committee, saddled with the task of housekeeping pending the return to the previous state of affairs.
Speaking with our reporter, the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Arachnid Araneae, fondly known as Spider, has said his Committee is ready for the daunting task ahead of them and will ensure stability till the suspension is finally lifted.
“The management has taken the right step by granting us permission to occupy the seat of power for students on this campus. For too long, the Kunle Adepeju Building has been desecrated by silence and inactivity. The fact that Kunle Adepeju was a martyr is no excuse for us to also murder the building, which bears his name. We have not only sent it to the grave, we have in fact made it a graveyard in itself,” he said, sitting behind a swivel chair that only recently graced the posterior of Ojo Aderemi.
“We understand that waiting for the reinstatement of the Union may be like waiting for Godot; however, my Committee members and I are ready for action. We are prepared to maintain the Union Building, safely keep the documents, and keep activities on-going for as long as is necessary,” he added confidently.
When asked who the other members of the committee are, Mr Arachnid mentioned Messrs Rattus Rattus (Black Rat), Bedbug, and Gecko as the General Secretary, Public Relations Officer, and Treasurer respectively.
Charles, one of the vendors whose shops are situated inside the building, expressed delight at the new development. “It feels good to finally have company in this place. At least, now we hear conversations and footsteps unlike before when it was total silence. Kudos to the school management,” he enthused.
It will be recalled that following a peaceful demonstration earlier this year, the University Senate had suspended all activities of the Students’ Union on 30th of May 2017. The Vice Chancellor, Professor Idowu Olayinka, has since been sighted on Facebook justifying the Union’s suspension and giving hope of its ultimate return.

Celebration as University of Ibadan acquires new technology to print SDC letters,https://punocracy.com/celebration-as-university-of-ibadan-acquires-new-technology-to-print-sdc-letters/,2018-03-07T02:19:25+01:00,"06 August 2017
It was all joy and merrymaking yesterday, 5 August 2017, at the Senate Chambers of the University of Ibadan, as staff of the institution celebrated the purchase of a state-of-the-art machine. This machine, it was gathered, is a sophisticated printer specially programmed for the production of SDC (i.e. Student Disciplinary Committee) letters.
While addressing journalists after the gala, the Media Assistant to the Vice Chancellor, Mr Sunday Saanu, said the introduction of the technology is long overdue and further reinforces the university’s claim as first and the best.
“For a long time, we have wanted to purchase this sort of technology, but we could not due to lack of funds. But recent developments on campus left us no choice but to cough out the money. The university believes this milestone, the first of its kind in Africa, will further expel doubts as to her constant ranking as the best,” he said.
“With the machine, we can now roll out SDC letters with ease,” he added. “They can be printed in thousands all at once, and in clear font too. There will be no room for ambiguity or timewasting.”
“The Vice Chancellor His Majesty, Professor Idowu Olayinka, is a visionary leader. We already have a blueprint to upgrade the machine by 2020 to one with AI (Artificial Intelligence). If that is done, the machine can print letters all by itself and even email to the concerned students. If we feel a student needs to be sanctioned, we just need to input his name or matriculation number, and the machine will find a fitting allegation for such student,” Sunday, further remarked.
“As a matter of fact, we hope to evolve soon to a stage where students will be given SDC letters alongside their admission letters. As you enter the university, the machine will project what your future offences will be, give you a query and fix dates for your hearing. Isn’t it brilliant?” he asked, his face beaming.
Asked how much the machine cost, he said he could not say for sure but it ranged between 10 and 15 million naira.
The machine was imported from the United States of America and is reported to have been produced by Draco and His Many Wives Ltd. The TA Report is also able to confirm that, in terms of hardware, it is a replica of one located at the White House, currently used by President Donald Trump to arbitrarily sack staff of the US Government.

UI Vice Chancellor admits brainy people don’t always get to the top,https://punocracy.com/ui-vice-chancellor-admits-brainy-people-dont-always-get-to-the-top/,2018-03-07T02:16:47+01:00,"04 August 2017
It came as a surprise when the number-one figure at the University of Ibadan, Professor Abel Idowu Olayinka, shared on his Facebook wall a listicle, on the 2nd of August, with the heading: “8 Reasons Why Brainy People Don’t Always Get to the Top.” The article which was written by Matshona Dhliwayo and published by the African Leadership Magazine provided reasons people of great intelligence do not often reach the peak in the institutions where they belong.
It was, and remains, unclear what message the Vice Chancellor was trying to pass. Was he saying his appointment as Vice Chancellor was not because he was the most intelligent of all candidates? Was he suggesting his case to be an exception? Or was he saying other qualities stood him out from among other respectable candidates as Professor Francis Egbokhare and Professor Oluleye? Perhaps the rare ability to deflate the gra-gra of a luta forces?
Whatever the intention was for sharing the piece, we may not be able to say for sure. But one thing is certain, the Vice Chancellor, who is approaching the end of his second year in office, is a smart administrator. The TA Report has come to this conclusion based on three premises: Only smart and brainy persons can always have their way the way Professor Olayinka has, with students especially; only smart persons have possession of facts no one else knows (even America), such as the existence of Agbowo Local Government; and lastly, Uncle Sunday Saanu would think so too.

Chaos as common sense leaves University of Ibadan,https://punocracy.com/chaos-as-common-sense-leaves-university-of-ibadan/,2018-03-07T02:14:37+01:00,"01 June 2017
There was pandemonium earlier today at the main gate as persons nearby sighted Common Sense storming out of the campus of Nigeria’s premier university. It was seen carrying a large backpack and two Ghana-must-go bags, suggesting that it was not returning anytime soon. All efforts by traders and passers-by to make it change its mind proved abortive.
According to Mr Akanni, an eye witness who sells books opposite the university, Common Sense was whining bitterly during its shocking exit.
“All of us at Agbowo were surprised to see Common Sense leaving University of Ibadan. We were worried because we do not know for how long the university can survive without it, and our businesses depend mostly on the student population. When we saw it, Common Sense was shouting, ‘I cannot take it anymore! I cannot take it anymore!’ like a madman,” he said gloomily.
Another eyewitness, Iya Tomiwa, equally a trader at Agbowo, expressed surprise that the security men who manned the school gate made no attempt to stop the occurrence.
“When we gathered to plead with Common Sense to remain for a little longer while we looked into its grievances, we were surprised to see the Abefele chatting as if nothing was amiss. One of them even came to clear the way for it to board a bus. It was as if they had been instructed to allow it go without check. We just do not understand,” she said.
In a phone conversation with Professor Idowu Olayinka, the Vice Chancellor of the university, he explained to The T.A. Report that Common Sense has proved too expensive and his administration no longer has money to maintain it.
“Good riddance if you ask me. Common Sense is too costly for us to maintain anyway. It has been pestering us to give students their ID cards, to respect all stakeholders, to provide constant electricity and so on. Let it just go to Agbowo Local Government where there is constant power supply,” he said.
“I’m just glad it did not wait for the Senate to look into its case. It is on the agenda for our next emergency sitting. It has just shown that it is indeed wise,” he added with a touch of sarcasm.
It will be recalled that the University recently instructed all undergraduate students to vacate the premises within hours for peacefully demonstrating against the non-provision of I.D. cards. It has also suspended all Students’ Union activities for the same reason.

Professor Abel Idowu Olayinka, Vice Chancellor of University of Ibadan, in a phone call with The T.A. Report, has explained why he mandated students to vacate the university premises before 6pm today. He said he is always not at his best with a lot of people around.
“Though the tone of my broadcast may suggest otherwise, students of the university should understand that my administration does not hate them. We are only telling them to leave the school to give us time to strategize and chart a way forward. Personally, I find it difficult to think clearly if I know 20,000 students are on campus under my rule. It is either they leave, or I leave for them,” he said.
“Besides, it is also in their best interest. Odude, the new Commissioner of Police is a crazy man. I know what he is capable of. With the protest going on in his jurisdiction, he may invade the school the next day and make true his words of killing our dear students. We definitely do not want that…for now.”
“Besides, our Moslem brothers now have all the time to themselves to fast,” he added jokingly.
He also appealed, in the phone conversation, to Ojo Aderemi, the Students’ Union President, not to resist the Senate decision.
“The new Students’ Union President should not try what that boy called Olateju tried with me last year. We will not condone any form of resistance or provocation. Ojo should in fact take this declaration as a blessing. It affords him, and that his Speaker, some time to grow more beard. That way, we will understand each other better. Maybe, even as equals,” the Vice Chancellor said.

Shocking! Tourette syndrome discovered in University of Ibadan,https://punocracy.com/shocking-tourette-syndrome-discovered-in-university-of-ibadan/,2018-03-07T02:00:24+01:00,"27 April 2017
Students of the University of Ibadan, for a while now, have been showing symptoms of a very strange disease called the Tourette syndrome. This shocking revelation is contained in a bulletin released by the university management on Wednesday, 26 April 2017. The syndrome is a neurological disorder characterised by involuntary tics and vocalisations, often the compulsive utterance of obscenities.
The symptoms appear to be aggravated between the hours 7 and 11 in the night, especially when power is not supplied to the halls of residence. They manifest in various ways. At times, a student with this disease may suddenly start woofing like a dog. Students have also been found to make sounds indistinguishable from those of chickens, cats, ghosts etc. Some have suggested that the source of the infection is UI Water and possibly UI Bread, which have been subjects of complaints for a long time.
Also, the University Management has just announced the introduction of a new unit in the school clinic, popularly known as Jaja, to cater for the embarrassing development. According to Mr Tunji Oladejo, the Director of Public Communications, “experts from China have been invited to properly diagnose and deal with the widespread cases. The university cannot afford to take chances, lest the disease, which we have been told is communicable, infects members of the staff.”
“Do not get me wrong please. We are concerned about the health status of our students; but it is no news that, for the current administration, the staff is the number one priority. We therefore have to leave no stone unturned to keep this situation under check,” he added.
Barack O’Payne, a Post-Graduate student and member of the Students’ Representative Council, told The T.A. Report that the situation is worse in halls of residence such as Independence Hall and Nnamdi Azikiwe Hall.
“It is funny that the school management is just taking notice of this. We have been seeing symptoms of this thing for a very long, even since my undergraduate days here, ranging then from cries like “Adewole o” to “I am hungry” and “Books are pursuing me”. History has it that it all started from Nnamdi Azikiwe Hall 10 or so years ago. And then, gradually it spread to Independence Hall, Lord Tedder Hall and so on. This is why cases in Zik and Indy remain Type A,” O’Payne said.
Freshmen who have yet to get accustomed to the situation of things have been complaining bitterly. Ms Iyanujesu Oluwatoyin, a resident of Queen Idia hall, told The T.A. Report that she was once admitted into the school clinic due to shock from the strange sounds.
According to her, “You see, I am terribly afraid of dogs. You may call it a phobia. About three weeks into the session, I was passing by Zik hall while going to my hall, and suddenly I heard dog noises from all corners. Thinking I was surrounded by those ugly beasts, I passed out. I had to be rushed to Jaja. Please, the school should find an urgent solution to this syndrome. We cannot go on like this.”

“My role model is Patience Jonathan” – says S.U. vice presidential aspirant,https://punocracy.com/my-role-model-is-patience-jonathan-says-s-u-vice-presidential-aspirant/,2018-03-07T01:40:42+01:00,"24 April 2017
Ms Akanni Olamide, an aspirant for the post of Students’ Union Vice President, has said in an exclusive interview with The T.A. Reports that she has so much respect for the former First Lady of the Federation, Mrs Patience Dame Jonathan. She said what some may consider as blunders are actually her way of imitating her beloved role model.
According to her, “What many people did not know is that Mama Peace have been my role model since I was in secondary school. She have also been my mentor for a while after I seeked her out at Aso Rock. I like her dressing style, I like her charisma, her humour, oratory ability and everything. She have a very special way of getting attention with the way she talks. That is what I have been following, and I think I am getting results.”
“I’m so excited about this election because I want to bring Aunty Patience to UI as a guest lecturer during the Students’ Union week,” she added.
When asked why the name “Team Assurance” as her campaign slogan, Ms Olamide said it was a mistake.
“I wanted to use Service2017, but my boyfriend said my service is not to the union but to him alone, so I changed my mind. Someone then suggested Team Assurance. I didn’t know why. But since it sounded cute and fashionable, I picked it. It was later on, after I had printed my banner that I borrowed a dictionary to check what it means,” she said.
“I want to tell Uites that I am sorry. It was a mistake o. Please I am not assuring you anything. Don’t come and say ‘Mide said this but did not do it. The only thing I can say is that I like fashion and I like services. I like servicing humanity, especially men who are in need.”
About her plans for the union if elected, Ms Olamide said there are none, but she knows she cannot fail because it is not her “portion.”
“Many have been promising in the past and have not been achieving anything. Many have planned without results. Ahn! Ahn! See, my own approach is: What if we did not plan and what if we did not promise? Is it not Albert Einstein that said it is mad people that cook with the same ingredients every time and expect a different taste?
“Please tell Uites to vote for me, especially those ones that like saying what does not concern them on Facebook. Tell them I am a good girl, and failure is not my portion.”

9 April 2017
The University of Ibadan, through the office of the Vice Chancellor, has voiced surprise at being ranked first by Webometrics in its first tertiary institution ranking for 2017. The Media Assistant to the V.C, Mr Sunday Saanu, while speaking to journalists on Saturday said it has come as a rude shock and that the university is considering a court action against the research group for the perceived blunder.
“Since the ranking was released in January, we have not had a second of rest. Our ICT experts have been running helter-skelter to see if there is any modicum of truth to this claim; but they have found none whatsoever. We have also been trying to see if a handshake has somehow travelled beyond the elbow somewhere,” he said.
“We find it difficult to understand why a so-called globally renowned research group would fabricate facts just so they may fit into general impression. And, as our school is one which stands firmly first for character before learning, we have instructed our legal team to look into the possibility of suing the body. We cannot afford to sacrifice integrity on the altar of cheap popularity.”
To buttress his statements, he reminded the reporters of a recent post by Pius Adesanmi, a Professor of Literature and African Studies at Carleton University, Canada, where he was quite critical of the university’s website.
“We shouldn’t forget so quickly what Professor Adesanmi wrote last month about the system. I agree with him completely that our website is atragic tale of broken links, non-existent URLs and other assorted evidence of 17th-century evidence.Ladies and gentlemen, let us not deceive ourselves; we cannot possibly top that ranking. No,” he said emphatically.
“This is not to say we are being lax about ICT. Not at all. The thing is this university works strictly with plans. We follow blueprints which we renew every five years. The one in operation presently is from 2015 to 2020, and there is nothing there about the website. It must have been an omission, but we promise to look into it come 2020,” he added.
It will be recalled that, in January, Webometrics released its first edition of the top 100 universities and polytechnics in Nigeria for 2017. The ranking, which provides indicators for more than 12,000 universities in the world, is based on university visibility, web access and web presence through domain, sub-pages, rich files and published scholarly articles.

UI management says overflowing drainage on Mellanby hall road part of Love Garden,https://punocracy.com/ui-management-says-overflowing-drainage-on-mellanby-hall-road-part-of-love-garden/,2018-03-06T21:22:59+01:00,"
6 April 2017
The Deputy Vice Chancellor Administration, Professor Emilolorun Ambrose Aiyelari, in response to calls to unclog the drainage just outside Kenneth Mellanby Hall, has said it is actually part and parcel of Gamaliel Onosode Garden, popularly known as Love Garden.
In a bid to find out why the school has not done anything about the blocked drainage and waterlogged road, The T.A. Report placed a call to the Professor. He explained that there is nothing to worry about as the situation was actually planned by the university authorities.
“Oh no, you have got it all wrong. The development on that road is deliberate. You see, unknown to most people, since the garden was created, we have always thought that something vital is missing. But we could not place our finger on it. Thankfully, last year, it hit us – a spring! How can we claim to have a garden without a spring? Silly, isn’t it?
“So we thought of having a fountain there, but the school Bursar said this would be way too expensive. Besides, it is not easy to sustain these kinds of things in a university such as ours. Take a look at the fountain Mellanby Hall for instance. It’s dried up now. I am aware Bello Hall also had something of the sort. They had to convert it into a fish pond, but they could not even manage that. We, therefore, decided to just clog the drainage a bit and create a passage way on the road. That way, we not only save costs, we also do not have to worry about power supply or long-term sustenance,” he said.
The T.A. Report also phoned Onifade Bello AbdulRahman, the Speaker of the Students Representative Council, to get this take on the issue. The school’s explanation, according to him, is the most ridiculous thing he has come across this year.
“In all my years on this campus, I have never come across such a ridiculous policy and attempt at rationalisation. Don’t the school know that the clogging is serving as a breeding ground for harmful organisms such as mosquitoes? It is also not befitting for a school that claims to be the first and the best. Most visitors pass by this road each time they come; imagine what thoughts shall cross their minds when they see the ugly sight,” he said.
The Intra-Campus Transport Committee has also expressed dissatisfaction at the development, with members threatening to increase transport rates due to damage caused to their vehicles by the fissure.

“We are not smart enough to decide for you” – Council of Student Stakeholders,https://punocracy.com/we-are-not-smart-enough-to-decide-for-you-council-of-student-stakeholders/,2018-03-06T21:18:21+01:00,"
6 April 2017
The Council of Student Stakeholders, the student version of SSANU (Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities), has come out with a message for the general student community. According to a brief press release made available to The T.A. Report on 6 April 2017, the Council admitted fallibility in its decisions, especially when it comes to endorsement of candidates.
The release further stated that voters should rather depend on the agendas and performances of candidates during the press and manifesto nights in deciding who to vote for.
Commenting on the release, OBJ, one of the aspirants for Students’ Union Presidency, said it is a welcome development.
“It is time Uites started seeing these endorsements for what they really are – political chauvinism and prostitution. For me, I think they are just a way of sustaining relevance and feeding the ego of the so-called stakeholders. It is good that the Council has come out to clear its intentions,” he said.
The full release, signed by the Council President, Mr Alabi Yusuf Teejay, and Secretary, Mr Shegz the Captain, reads thus:
We have been reliably informed that some Uites are planning to vote in the forthcoming Students’ Union elections based only on the endorsement of the stakeholders in their halls or faculties. We are not only perplexed to hear this, we unanimously also consider it laughable.
Our decisions are in no way meant to influence the electoral decisions of the electorate because we are not smart enough to decide for you. We are, after all, all intellectuals. The manifestoes, campaigns, and nights [i.e. press night and manifesto night] are there to guide everyone.
We only endorse candidates really because we have nothing else to do. And, as stakeholders, we have to declare support for likely winners of the election in order to remain relevant and indispensable.
Presently, the Council is not recognised by the Student Handbook and the Students’ Union Constitution. But our administration is working fervently towards passing a bill to the S.R.C. to remedy the situation. Through this, we believe our legislators can legitimise and propose statutory duties for the council. This way, we will have other things to keep us busy, while not having to bother about endorsements.
We thank all Uites for their understanding and continued support.

4 April 2017
In what appears to be her first official pronouncement, University of Ibadan’s DVC for Research, Innovation and Strategic Planning (RISP), Professor Adenike Adeyemo, has said students and lecturers may now write on the electronic, interactive whiteboards using temporary markers. She said this yesterday, 3 April 2017, at the university’s Administrative Building during a press conference.
According to her, the objects, which were donated to the institution years ago and which are available in most lecture rooms, have been lying fallow and “this has to stop.”
“You see, as the Deputy Vice Chancellor in charge of strategic planning, I have to see to the maximum use of resources within the university. And after an intensive brainstorming session with my aides, we decided that it is high time we put these boards to good use,” she said.
“It may be said that ‘but why can’t we use them to serve the purpose for which they were built.’ Well, it is no news that power supply is not that stable on campus, and this is a mighty mighty hindrance. But above all, the technology is too advanced for a university like UI. I have seen it used in Harvard and it was like voodoo. I’m telling you, our lecturers are not ready. Besides, our students who are used to getting dictated notes may not even understand well enough by the time we start using the board normally.”
Professor Adenike, whose position was formally named DVC RIP until the ominous import (i.e. Rest in Peace) was pointed out, said the only solution is to improvise.
In her words, “Lecturers have been coming to us to complain that they have nowhere to write key points in class. So, for us, this is the only solution. University of Ibadan has constantly been the best in Nigeria, and this is for no other reason than our creativity and optimum use of scarce resources.”
“We have just set up a committee to also look into the case of air conditioners which are not being used. We have no doubt that, very soon, some good use will be found for them as well,” she added.
It will be recalled that the university Senate, during its sitting on 8 March 2017, had elected Professors Adeyinka Aderinto and Adenike Adeyemo as the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Academic and Deputy Vice Chancellor, Research, Innovation and Strategic Partnership respectively. The T.A. Report wishes them all the best in their official endeavours.

Residents of various student halls in the University of Ibadan yesterday told The T.A. Report that they do not want porters to resume work at all. According to them, they have fared better during the Non-Academic Staff Union strike compared to the time before it started.
Ms Tomisin, the Chairperson of Queen Elizabeth II Hall, said since the industrial action began, there have been no incidents of infringement on privacy or indiscriminate fining of residents.
“This two-week period of strike has led us to realise that we have no need whatsoever for the so-called porters. They are useless, if not even harmful. The school should stop wasting hard-earned IGR on these people. We can take care of the hall ourselves. With them not around, we have been sleeping quietly with no fear of some man barging in. And there have also been no cases of innocents getting fined for the crimes of others,” she said.
The Chairman of their neighbouring hall Mellanby, Mr Oyegunle Gbenga Paul, also opined along similar lines.
“Let someone please tell the management that we have no need for porters. My executives and I agreed during our last meeting that it is high time we ported to a porter-free world. When the porters were around, two or three successful burglaries were committed under their lazy noses. But since they left, we have had no such incidents,” he said.
“Only God knows if they were even complicit in these crimes,” Paul, who is also a popular public speaker on campus, added with fitting hand gesticulation.
Mr Abass Adeyemi, a student of Microbiology, even suggested that the porters should be sacked without compensation. According to him, they do not deserve any pity.
“E don tire me sef. Oh, just the thought of them resuming,” he said with a look of disgust.
When asked to expatiate, he said, “Every day, all they do is watch television, fine students unnecessarily and engage in chitchat. If they are not doing these, then they will be molesting our ear drums with ballistic missiles under the guise of public announcements. They should all be sacked without exception and without pity. The university administration should even don them with a gown of misconduct and give them no compensation whatsoever.”
All efforts to get comments from the Students’ Union President, Mr Ojo Nifemi Emmanuel, proved abortive. All indications have it that he is presently MIA (missing in action) and AWOL (absent without leave).
It will be recalled that the NASU Chairman, Mr Segun Arojo, on Saturday declared the strike (earlier described by the Union of Campus Journalists as the fart of an ant) suspended.
