# Sarcasm Detection Task

This project is an individual preliminary work on Natural Language Processing, focusing on detecting sarcasm in the dataset. It explores machine learning models as the baseline models. Moreover, it implements deep learning methods that would aid in discovering more complex patterns from the dataset.
